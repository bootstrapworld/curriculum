= Linear Functions [Rocket-height]

== Facilitation - Link to SlideDeck

Students will be able to:

* Represent linear motion as a function
* Explain the difference between a function’s Domain and Range
* Write examples of how a function works given concrete inputs


== Big Idea

Students will be able to interpret and write linear functions


== Key Points

* Driving example is using a function to represent motion
* The starter file doesn’t produce any motion at first
* All steps of the design recipe are helpful for planning out our function
* Writing examples helps us catch mistakes
* Circling the things that change between examples helps us tell
which parts of the calculation are variables

== Guiding Questions

* When is it helpful to write a function as opposed to
to an expression? _(When we have repeated work we would like
to perform on any input: i.e., always multiplying a given
number by 7)_
* What other real-world situations might we use functions for?
* What does it mean to move at a constant rate?

== Implementation Guidelines

* Students must be familiar with The Design Recipe for this
activity

Pedagogy points:

* Function on multiple lines
* Why do we write examples?
* What mistakes did you/your partner make in DR

| 
* Write a function pc-diameter that takes a number and produces a
circle with the given diameter

* Write a function rocket-from-platform that takes a time and a
platform height and produces the height of the rocket at the
given time assuming it started from a platform of the given
height
