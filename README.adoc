We describe here the directories and files in the `curriculum`
directory, and how to use the programs provided.

For a generated document tree, please see
https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2023/en-us

== Structure of the `curriculum` directory

The top directory contains a bunch of scripts and subdirectories.

The curriculum content is placed in the subdirectories `lessons`
and `pathways`. `lessons` contains individual lessons, including
the lesson plan, exercises, and printable pages. `pathways`
contains pathway directories, each of which defines a collection
of lessons. (It is possible for a lesson to occur in multiple
pathways.)

The subdirectories `lib` and `shared` contain the components of
the program used to generate web pages and PDFs from the
`lessons` and `pathways`.  For instance, `lib` contains a general glossary of terms
used in the lessons: `glossary-terms.json`. `shared` contains directories named for
the various natural languages used for instruction, e.g., `en-us`
for US English, and `es-mx` for Mexican Spanish. Inside these
dwell centralized educational-standards dictionaries, e.g.,
`standards/standards-csta-dictionary.json` is a list of standards defined
by the CSTA.

The file `Makefile` is used (via `make`) to
constructs the web pages and PDFs a directory called
`distribution`.

Here is a skeleton of the `curriculum` tree, showing the salient
files, with a sample lesson and sample pathway:

  curriculum/
    Makefile
    lib/
      <language-independent implementation files>
      *.rkt
      *.css

              pages/
                *.{adoc,pdf}
                workbook-pages.txt
              solution-pages/
                *.adoc
                workbook-pages.txt
            back-matter/
              pages/
              solution-pages/
            resources/
              index.adoc
              images/
                *.{png,gif,jpg}
                lesson-images.json
              pages/
                *.{adoc,pdf}
                workbook-pages.txt

Some standard subdirectory names are used to separate and shadow
content based on (natural) language of instruction, the
programming language used, or whether content is being built for
student or teacher. Thus:

- The `langs` subdirectory uses further subdirectories, e.g.,
`en-us` for US English, `es-mx` for Mexican Spanish, and `fr` for French. Source
documents from the relevant natural language are chosen based on
the value of the makefile variable `$NATLANG` during build.
The default is
`en-us`. In order to ease transition, if a language other than
`en-us` is chosen, any content unavailable in the new language is
filled in by what's in `en-us`.

- Some of the directories have `pyret` and `wescheme`
subdirectories or both. These contain content that should shadow
the default content (one directory level up) if that
programming language is used.

- The directory `solution-pages` is used to house source
that will shadow `pages`, when the pages meant only for
teacher use are created.

In all these cases, it is important that the shadowing content
have the same file _basename_ as the content that is being
shadowed. Extensions can vary; thus it is possible for
`filename.pdf` to shadow `filename.adoc` and vice versa.

=== Structure of a lesson directory

Each lesson has a subdirectory, e.g., `sample-lesson`, under the
`lessons` directory.

A lesson plan is specified by an `.adoc` file in the language
directory for that lesson, e.g.,
`sample-lesson/langs/en-us/index.adoc`. While the file basename
doesn’t
have to be `index`, ensure that there is only one `.adoc` file at
this level.

Images are in subdirectory `images`.

Single printable and optionally printable pages are in subdirs `pages`
and `solution-pages` (some of these can be static PDFs
rather than adoc source files).
(The `solution-` versions, as already explained, are meant to supply
shadowing content intended for teacher-only documents.)

The file `pages/workbook-pages.txt` lists
the pages -- one per line -- in the
`pages` directory in the order in which they should show up in the
final workbook. By default,
these pages are rendered in portrait mode. If you desire a
particular file `file.adoc` to be in landscape, its entry line in
`workbook-pages.txt` should be `file.adoc landscape` rather
than just `file.adoc`. (The
entry `file.adoc` is convenient shorthand for `file.adoc
portrait`.)  (The words `landscape` and `portrait` may
be in any case.) Supplementary `adoc` files used by these pages
can be stored in subdirectories, typically named `fragments`.

Lesson pages are paginated by default when they show up in the
workbook. If you don’t want a page to be populated, its entry
line in `workbook-pages.txt` should be `file.adoc portrait
nopagenum`. (The aspect should also be mentioned, even if it’s
the default.)

(Any of the components in an entry line in `workbook-pages.txt`
may be enclosed in double-quotes.)

==== The images/ subdirectory

As mentioned above, the images for a lesson are collected in a
subdirectory called `images`.  References to these images in the adoc
files are of the form `@image{path-to-image-file, width}`, where the
`path-to-image-file` is the relative pathname of the chosen image file
in `images`, and the optional `width` is the desired width of the image.

The `images` also contains a `lesson-images.json` file that lists all
the image files in the same directory with their associated metadata,
i.e., _caption_, _description_, _source_, and _license_. The topmost
JSON object in this file maps each image name to an object containing
its metadata.

Here is an example:

  "louis.png": {
    "caption": "Louis",
    "description": "A very good standard apricot poodle named Louis",
    "source": "Image from Louis's hooman",
    "license": "Creative Commons 4.0 - NC - SA"
  }

Captions are optional and will print under the image on the webpage and printable exercises. They can be left out if no caption is desired.

Descriptions are for visually impaired folks using screenreaders so need to be detailed enough to allow students to engage with our materials. For example:

    "description" : "pie chart: 44.6% white, 22.8% Black, 19.8% Hispanic/Latinx, 9.9% Asian, Small wedges for some other race alone and 2 or more races",

If an image is created by us, not derived from other work, and is not a data display, use

    "source" : "Created by the Bootstrap Team.",
    "license" : "Creative Commons 4.0 - NC - SA"

If an image is created by us and derived from other work, indicate that. Here's an example of how we credit the data cycle images:

    "source" : "Created by the Bootstrap Team based on work from @link{http://introdatascience.org/, Mobilizing IDS project} and @link{https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/GAISE/GAISEPreK12_Intro.pdf, GAISE}",
    "license" : "Creative Commons 4.0 - NC - SA"
  },

If an image is a data display created by us using real data, please specify the source. For example:

    "source" : "Created by the Bootstrap Team using data from https://nces.ed.gov/Programs/Edge/ACSDashboard",
    "license" : "Creative Commons 4.0 - NC - SA"
  },

If an image is a data display created using fictitious data, please indicate that.

    "source" : "Created by the Bootstrap Team using contrived data",
    "license" : "Creative Commons 4.0 - NC - SA"

The build will issue warnings for underdefined images when `description`, `source`, or `license` are missing. (You will get warnings even if the value is an empty string. However, for the moment, empty-string captions are ignored.)

The build process collects all the image descriptions into a single file
`images.js` in `distribution/en-us`.

=== Structure of a pathway directory

Each pathway has a subdirectory, e.g., `sample-pathway`, under the
`pathways` directory.

A pathway narrative is specified by an `.adoc` file in the
language directory for that pathway, e.g.,
`sample-pathway/langs/en-us/index.adoc`. The file basename
doesn’t have to be `index`, but there should be only one `.adoc`
file in this directory.

There can also be a file `external-index.rkt` used to expand
pointers to URLs in the pathway narrative (see below).

In the same directory, the file `lesson-order.txt` lists
the names of the lessons (e.g., `sample-lesson`)
that should be included in the
pathway, in the order in which they should appear in the pathway
workbook. (The filename can be enclosed in double-quotes.)

The pathway directory can also contains a `resources`
subdirectory, where an `.adoc` file describes the “Teacher
Resources” page. There should be only one such `.adoc` file, but
it can be named anything (not necessarily `index.adoc`).

== Building and deploying using the Makefile

The top dir contains `Makefile`. Type `make` to build the distribution,
to populate the `distribution/` directory with the built documentation.

`make` can take optional targets on the command line:

- `book` -- creates the PDF versions of the HTML files, as also the
  workbook PDFs. By default, these are not created as it is a relatively
  time-consuming process and is required only after the author is sure
  that the HTML conversions have been thoroughly debugged

- `clean` -- removes `distribution/` so the next make builds from
  scratch. If this is the only option, there is no build done!

- `csv` -- makes a CSV version of the entire converted (`en-us` version
  only, for now) docs in `distribution/en-us/curriculum.csv`

- `deploy` -- deploys. (See section on "Deployment")

- `force` -- removes `distribution/` and builds from scratch

- `help` -- displays a brief help message

- `linkcheck` -- checks the various internal and external links in
  the documents to ensure they are valid. By default, this check isn't
  done to save time

`make` can take the following variable settings on the command line to guide the
build:

- `NATLANG=lang` -- builds for the natural language `lang`. The default is
  `en-us` (**En**glish *US*) . Currently, the only other language that has
  significant support is `es-mx` (**es**pañol **m**e**x**icano)

- `SEMESTER=season` -- typically either `fall` or
  `spring`. The default is `fall`

- `YEAR=yyyy` -- typically the four-digit year
  of the Common Era. The default is the current year followed by
  `-BETA`

- `COURSE=p1,p2,\...` -- if `book` is also specified, this makes the
  workbook PDFs and the related lesson PDFs _only_ for the comma-separated
  pathways `p1`, `p2`, `\...` specified

- `DEBUGADOC=nonempty` -- this runs Asciidoctor individually on each file.
  This is slow as molasses, but helps locate any AsciiDoc syntax error
  such as unterminated table blocks, as
  opposed to preprocessing errors. `nonempty` is any non-empty
  alphanumeric string. Some mnemonic values are `yes`, `y`, `true`, `t`,
  `1`.

- `TPC=n` -- We use puppeteer-cluster to generate the thousands of PDF files use in the student workbooks. By default, the cluster runs 2 tabs per core (TPC). This can be set to a higher number via this commandline argument, gaining speed at the cost of possible race-conditions.

[CAUTION]
--
`NATLANG`, `SEMESTER`, `YEAR`, `COURSE`, `DEBUGADOC`, and `TPC` are _makefile_
variables, *not* shell environment variables! You cannot set them as
environment variables and expect `make` to pick them up. To set,
`NATLANG`, say, to `es-mx`, use

  make NATLANG=es-mx

Calls such as

  NATLANG=es-mx make
  NATLANG=es-mx; make
  export NATLANG=es-mx; make

will not work! This is intentional: to avoid the build picking up
environment variables that were possibly set for other purposes.
--

The doctree for the built pathway (e.g., `data-science`) for the prose language `en-us`,
resides in
`distribution/en-us/courses/`. Thus:

    distribution/
      en-us/
        courses/
          data-science/
            index.shtml
            workbook/
              workbook.pdf
              workbook-long.pdf
              opt-exercises.pdf
            resources/
              protected/
                workbook-sols.pdf
                workbook-long-sols.pdf
                opt-exercises-sols.pdf

Here `index.shtml` is the web page corresponding to the pathway
narrative. The student workbooks in `workbook/` are

- `workbook.pdf`, the basic student workbook
- `workbook-long.pdf`, above plus the optional exercises
- `opt-exercises.pdf`, just the optional exercises

The teacher workbooks in `resources/protected` are

- `workbook-sols.pdf`, the basic teacher workbook, i.e., with solutions
- `workbook-long-sols.pdf`, above plus the optional exercises
- `opt-exercises-sols.pdf`, just the optional exercises

These filenames are standard and do not vary with course. Their location
identifies which course they describe.

Note that many workbook PDFs can be created: the students’ versions
are created
in the `workbook` directory; the teachers’ versions in
the “protected” directory
`resources/protected`.

Pages under `resources/protected` may prompt you for a teacher
password, which is available on signing up with Bootstrapworld.

The lessons referred to by the various pathways reside in
`distribution/en-us/lessons/`. Thus:

     distribution/
       en-us/
         lessons/
           sample-lesson/
             index.shtml
             pages/
             solution-pages/

For slide generation, please see
link:./README-slides.adoc[].

For more on the build process in general, see
link:lib/maker/doc/index.adoc[].

=== Sensible re-making

As expected of `make`, subsequent calls to it will only rebuild those
files in the `distribution/` that need to be updated, based on
modifications to the source files in the repo.

However, if you haven't changed the source docs, but there have been
changes to the building programs themselves (in `lib/`), or the
library/data files (in `shared/`), you will often need to regenerate the
entire `distribution/` from scratch.

You can manually delete the `distribution` directory and make again.

Alternatively, you can use the `make` target `clean`:

   make clean

This deletes any existing `distribution` (it is not an error if it doesn't
exist). A subsequent `make` builds anew.

You can also use `make force` followed by any other options (if needed).
This implicitly calls `make clean` before proceeding with the other
options.

Remember, re-making the entire distribution takes time, and is often too
drastic a step if you're working on one or two lessons, are
satisfied with local debugging, and immediate deployment is not the
goal. In such cases, you can simply go into `distribution/en-us/lessons`
and manually delete only those lessons that you want rebuilt. You can also manually
delete pathways in `distribution/en-us/courses` to rebuild specific
pathways. A subsequent `make` (even without `force`) will cleanly re-make
just your desired lessons and/or pathways, leaving the rest of the
`distribution/` untouched.

Be careful while deleting stuff in `distribution/` expecting them to be
regenerated. Deleting at too fine a grain (just one file, say) may not
always succeed in regenerating it. It's best to stick to deleting whole
lessons or pathways.

=== Deployment
(This section is relevant only to administrators.)

* You'll want sshpass in your environment to smooth the deployment process

  - on Linux/WSL: `sudo apt-get install sshpass`
  - on macOS: <Emmanuel, write this when someone needs it!>


* After `make`-ing the distribution, it may be deployed to the web host
using the `make` target `deploy`:

    make deploy

We
currently deploy to:
https://www.bootstrapworld.org

A typical `make deploy` goes to something like
https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023, assuming that
the environment variables `SEASON` and `YEAR` are `fall` and `2023`
respectively. These environment variables may be set at your OS
command line or in your shell profile, or on the `make` command line, e.g.,

    make SEASON=fall YEAR=2023 deploy

IMPORTANT: If `SEASON` and `YEAR` are not set externally _and_ are not
supplied on the `make`
command line, the default values of `fall` and `yyyy-BETA` (where `yyyy`
is the current year) are used. This is to prevent inadvertently
overwriting
a currently active deployment. _Always explicitly set `SEASON` and
`YEAR` when deploying in earnest._

Deployment requires that you have enabled SSH access to the website machine,
and that the environment variables `HOSTINGER_IPADDR`,
`HOSTINGER_USER`, and `HOSTINGER_PORT` are set to the appropriate values.

TIP: You are allowed to set these environment variables as makefile
variables, i.e., as options to `make`. However, it may be more
convenient to store these as environment variables, as, once set, they are unlikely
to change.

You will be prodded for your webhost password,
once to copy the files over and another time
to unpack them on the webhost machine.

[TIP]
--
Deployment uses
SSH to interact with your webost.
account. This can be slow. If you're updating an already deployed
doctree, you may set the variable `SKIPLIB` to save yourself the time taken
to recopy the large mathjax library, since it's unlikely to have
changed:

    make SKIPLIB=true deploy
--

== Standards compliance

The standards compliance for the various lessons is documented in the
directory `shared/langs/en-us/standards/'. In it are
dictionaries for the
various standards. For now, these are:

  standards-cc-ela-dictionary.json
  standards-cc-math-dictionary.json
  standards-cc-states-dictionary.json
  standards-csta-dictionary.json
  standards-ia-dictionary.json
  standards-k12cs-dictionary.json
  standards-ma-dictionary.json
  standards-ngss-dictionary.json
  standards-ok-dictionary.json

Each dictionary entry associates an educational standard label with its description
and all the lessons that comply with it. E.g., the following is an entry in the
dictionary file `standards-cc-math-dictionary.json`

    "6.EE.B": {
       "description": "Reason about and solve one-variable equations and inequalities.",
       "lessons": [
          "inequalities1-simple",
          "inequalities2-compound"
        ]
     }

It associates the label `6.EE.B` with the description `Reason about and
solve one-variable equations and inequalities.`, and says that the two
lessons `inequalities1-simple` and `inequalities2-compound` comply with
it. As you create or modify lessons, add their names to the
appropriate standard entries as appropriate.

The build process creates a menu for finding out the standards
complied with by the lessons and the pathway. The lesson’s menu
is embedded in the lesson plan, whereas the pathway’s (larger)
menu is linked to.

=== Other compliances

Compliances with textbooks and practices are similarly documented in the
subdirectories `textbooks/` and `practices/` of the `shared/langs/en-us`
directory.

== Lesson prerequisites

The directive `@lesson-prereqs{}` is used as a placeholder in a
table for row(s) that include lesson prerequisites (if any) and
standards. (The mode of inclusion may change in subsequent
versions depending on how predictable lesson-plan formats
become. For now, we need a placeholder.)

== Git basics

=== Cloning the repo
(This only works if you have been given access!)

Clone the repo directly, then `cd` into the folder:

  git clone https://github.com/bootstrapworld/curriculum
  cd curriculum

=== Creating your private branch in the original repo

Alternatively -- and this will work only for greenlisted members
-- clone the repo directly and add your own branch, e.g.,

  git clone https://github.com/bootstrapworld/curriculum
  cd curriculum
  git checkout -b my-sandbox

You can pull and merge from `master` as needed:

  git checkout master
  git pull
  git checkout my-sandbox
  git merge master

If conflicts arise, you will be given a way to resolve them.

=== Making a fork of the repo
Fork this repo to your GitHub account (say, `jrandomuser`). (This is done using
obvious buttons on the GitHub page.)

In your terminal, clone your fork thusly:

   git clone https://github.com/jrandomuser/curriculum

This will create a local repo where you can try things, change
things, etc. But first, to retain connection with the original do:

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/bootstrapworld/curriculum

Every time the original changes, update like so:

  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/master

You are probably in your own `master` branch. Even if you’re
“branching out” to other new branches, the above merge will
mostly work.  “Mostly” because merge often triggers conflicts
depending on how far you have diverged from the original. At the
very least, make sure you’ve checked in all your changes that you
care about, before you attempt a merge. For changes you aren’t
ready to check in, save the concerned files somewhere else, and
make sure there are no “modified” files in your directory.

== Setting up your environment

You will need a Unix-like environment to construct documents from this repo:

  - If you're already on some flavor of unix, you're there! ✅
  - If you're on Windows, you'll want to install
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[WSL2] to give yourself a Linux environment first (we recommend Ubuntu).
  - If you're on MacOS, your environment is close but missing some Unix tools. You'll want to install https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] first, * then follow the "Next Steps" directions Homebrew suggests.

The subsections that follow will walk you through installing the following tools:

* Bash, which keeps all the scripts humming. (This is already available on Linux, macOS, and WSL) ✅
* `jq`, used for checking correctness of JSON files
* Racket, to do pre-processing and other bookkeeping.
* Asciidoctor, a Ruby program, to generate HTML from AsciiDoc.
* Lua, used for postprocessing.
* Node, A javascript runtime used by the packages below.
* NVM, or the "Node Version Manager". Allows us to use a specific version of Node.
* Several Node packages:
  - `puppeter`, and HTML -> PDF generator that converts web pages into PDF documents
  - `puppeteer-cluster` to build the hundreds of pages we have in parallel.
  - `pdf-lib`, which handles collecting all the PDFs and adding page numbers
  - `md2googleslides`, which generates slide decks from markdown files in each of the lesson plans
  - `mathjax`, which generates beautifully formatted math output

=== In macOS...

* Most packages can be installed via `brew`, with the following terminal command:
+
  brew install gnu-sed curl make coreutils gnu-tar lua asciidoctor pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman nvm jq racket

* Mac users will also need to add these unix tools to their `$PATH`. In the terminal, run `open ~/.zshrc` to edit your configuration file. Add the following to the bottom of the file, then save and quit-and-reopen your terminal:
+
  # add every gnu tool we have as a prefix to the path
  eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
  if type brew &>/dev/null; then
    HOMEBREW_PREFIX=$(brew --prefix)
    for d in ${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/opt/*/libexec/gnubin; do export PATH=$d:$PATH; done
  fi

=== In Unix or WSL...

* Most packages can be installed via `sudo apt-get install`, with the following terminal command:
+
  sudo apt-get install jq asciidoctor lua5.4 curl
+

* To install Racket:
+
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:plt/racket
  sudo apt install racket
+

* To install NVM:
+
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash


=== Additional Tools for Sublime

If you use the [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/), we've also created some tools that make authoring more pleasant and readable.

* There are two packages inside the `lib/sublime-settings/` folder in the repository. Both need to be copied into your Sublime User folder.

** *On MacOS*, enter the following in your Terminal: +
`open \~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User`

** *On Windows*, enter the following in your Windows Terminal: +
`explorer %APPDATA\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User`

Once these files are copied, quit and relaunch Sublime Text. You can now switch the Syntax mode from Asciidoctor to Asciidoctor+ when viewing an .adoc file, and Sublime will remember your preference for all future adoc files.

== Authoring guidelines

The `.adoc` files peppering this curriculum repo are written in
general-purpose AsciiDoc overlaid with some preprocessing directives written in
Racket that are available only in our documentation base.

AsciiDoc is a plain-text-based markup that is converted
by the Asciidoctor program into HTML.

=== A brief introduction to AsciiDoc

An AsciiDoc source file typically has the extension `.adoc`, at
least in our setup.

A title (aka “level 0”) header has its line preceded by a single
equal sign.

Level 1 headers (“sections”) are preceded by two equal signs.
Similarly for “subsections” at level 2, 3, 4, 5.

  = Title at level 0

  == Section at level 1

  === Subsection at level 2

  ==== Header at level 3

  ===== Header at level 4

  ====== Header at level 5

(That's it. Headers of level 6+ are not provided.)

TIP: By convention, the level of a section is one less than the number of `=` signs
used to specify it.

Itemized lists have each item paragraph preceded by a ``*`` or
``-`` and space.

Emphasized text is set within underscores: `+_emphasized text_+`.

Bold text is set within stars: `+*bold text*+`.

In-text code fragments are set within backticks: ``++`code fragment`++``.

Code displays are on contiguous lines that are indented (amount
of indentation doesn’t matter as long it’s non-0).

It's quite possible, and encouraged, to write decent AsciiDoc documents
without knowing all of its syntax.
Learn just the bare minimum to get started writing,
and then learn more as needed, either from the online manual, or by bugging
me. (If something seems too tedious to learn or input, I could
perhaps implement a simpler Racket directive.)

If your Asciidoctor version is at least 2.0.0, you can type

  asciidoctor --help syntax

to get a brief reference guide to the syntax. To create a browsable HTML
file, do

  asciidoctor --help syntax | asciidoctor - -o help.html

and open `help.html` in your browser.

=== Racket preprocessing

The `.adoc` files we author can contain some additional markup,
which we shall call _directives_.  All directives begin with an
`@`, and, if they take arguments, the latter are encased in
braces (`{}`). Here are all the directives:

==== Glossary

Glossary items are annotated with the directive `@vocab`. E.g.,

  @vocab{function}

In a lesson plan, such items are searched in the main glossary
file, `lib/glossary-terms.json`, and are inserted as lists at the
head of the document.

For a pathway narrative, the glossary items from all its
constituent lessons are collected into a file
`pathway-standards.shtml` that is linked to in the narrative
page.

// doesn't look like we're using shadowing glossaries anymore?

There can be auxiliary glossary files in `lib/` that can be used
to _shadow_ the main glossary for particular lessons. For now,
the only such shadowing glossary file is `glossary-terms-ss.json`,
used for Social-Studies lessons.

In order for a lesson `lessonA` to use a shadowing glossary, its
directory, i.e., `lessons/lessonA/langs/en-us`, should contain a
file `shadow-glossary.txt` that contains the name of the
shadowing glossary file.

===== Syntax of the glossary-terms.json file

The `glossary-terms.json` file (and any shadowing files) defines a JSON
object that is a list of glosses.
Each
gloss is an object with keys for the various natural languages in use
(for now, `"en-us"` and `"es-mx"`). The value for each such natlang is an
object with the following mappings:

- `"keywords"`, which specifies a list of sublists, each sublist listing
grammatically-related strings. Any of these can be used in the source
(whatever fits the prose flow), but the item in the generated glossary
will be the first string in the sublist.
+
An example value could be `[ ["mean"], ["average" "ave" "avg"] ]`. The
word in the source is used to find the relevant sublist, and _its_ first
item is used in the generated glossary.

- `"description"`, the definition for the glossed item.

[TIP]
--
As a convenience, it is not necessary to specify simple grammatical
declensions in the glossary file. Thus, in the glossary entry for
`"coordinate"` you don't need to tack on `"coordinates"`, although you
can call `@vocab` on either term in your source with the assurance that
they will both refer to `"coordinate"`.

For English (`en-us`), this convenience covers:

- `"-s"`, `"-es"`, `"-y/-ies"` plurals and singular present tense, e.g.,
  `"cars"` maps to `"car"`, `"boxes"` to `"box"`, `"stories"` to
  `"story"`, `"applies"` to `"apply"`
- `"-d"`, `"-ed"`, `"y/-ied"` preterites, e.g., `"saved"` maps to
  `"save"`, `"turned"` to `"turn"`, `"applied"` to `"apply"`
- `"-ing"` gerunds, e.g., `"applying"` maps to `"apply"`

Latin (the aforementioned `"axis"`/`"axes"`) and Old English plurals
(`"child"`/`"children"`) need explicit entries however; sorry!

Spanish (`es-mx`) has its own set of declension detection mechanisms
(`"-iones"` to `"-ión"`, `"-ques"` to `"-c"`, `"-gues"` to `"-g"`,
`"-ces"` to `"-z"`, `"-es"` to `""`).

==== Lesson descriptions and dependencies

Each lesson plan is strongly advised to start out with a

  @description{A brief paragraph describing the lesson.}

The description is displayed in the lesson plan, but is also part
of the autogenerated thumbnails used by the pathway narrative for
each of its lessons.

A lesson can optionally include a set of keywords, which are used
when searching for lesson content. While the title, description,
and standards alignment are already included in the search,
occasionally there are search terms a user might employ which are
_not_ reflected in any part of the lesson (e.g., “PEMDAS”, “GEMDAS”). These
keywords can be added anywhere in the lesson with the `keywords`
directive: `@keywords{PEMDAS, GEMDAS}`. Multiple keywords are comma-separated.

==== Callout Boxes

===== Strategy boxes

Use

----
@strategy{This is the title}{

  This is some _body_ text.

}
----

to generate a “strategy box”, a boxed text with a blue border.

===== Lesson "Points"

Use

  @lesson-point{
    This is an important point!
  }

to generate letterboxed text to emphasize critical points.

// @lesson-point{
//    This is an important point!
// }

===== Lesson Instruction

Use

  @lesson-instruction{
  - Do this first
  - Then this
  - And finally this
  }

to generate a list of instructions, inside a box with the "letterhead"
of a teacher at a whiteboard.

==== Exercises

Exercise files are typically recipes and have calls to one of two
directives

  @design-recipe-exercise{...}

  @assess-design-recipe{...}

The former is used to specify a correct recipe; the latter to
introduce a recipe that needs to be debugged. For examples of
such recipes, please see the `.adoc` files in the various
`fragments` subdirectories in the repo.

==== Calling preproc routines directly

Some files are more elaborate than recipes and contain
sketches of solutions and tables that need to be filled. These
use some extra directives like `@do`, `@show`, `@showsoln`, and `@code` that then
use raw Racket code to format the exercise. Examples of
these can be found in the `Supplemental` lesson.

===== Code fragments

`@show` can call the preproc procedure `code` to typeset code fragments.
The code fragment is specified in s-expression format, and gets
converted to the appropriate format based on the prevailing programming
lang, e.g., s-exp for WeScheme and in-fix for Pyret.

  @show{(code '(+ 1 2))}

===== Circles of Evaluation (CoEs)

`@show` can invoke the procedure `coe` to typeset a _circle of
evaluation_ (_CoE_):

  @show{(coe '(+ 1 2))}

Sometimes portions of the code are left blank as an exercise. Use `(?ANS
suggested-solution)` in place of such portions. In student-facing pages,
this shows up as a blank. In solutions mode, the suggested solution is
inserted. E.g.,

  @show{(coe '(+ (?ANS 1) 2))}

===== Contracts

Sometimes, just a contract (part of a recipe) needs to be shown
in the text. Use `@show` to call the Racket procedures `contract`
(for a single contract)
or `contracts` (for multiple).

  @show{(contract "/" '("Number" "Number") "Number")}

Strings may drop the double-quotes (i.e., become symbols) as long as
they're quoted somehow. Thus, the above contract is equivalent to:

  @show{(contract "/" '(Number Number) "Number")}
  @show{(contract '/ '(Number Number) 'Number)}

This states that the function name is `/`, its domain list is
`("Number" "Number")` and its range is `"Number"`.

  @show{(contract "/" '("Number" "Number") "Number"
    "divides one number by another")}

adds an optional fourth argument stating the function's purpose.

You can add parameter names for each function argument:

  @show{(contract "/" '(("dividend" "Number") ("divisor" "Number"))
    "Number")}

This adds the parameter names (`dividend`, `divisor`) as annotations
under the corresponding type names.

To show multiple contracts,

  @show{(contracts
    '("/" ("Number" "Number") "Number" "divides one number by another")
    '("*" ("Number" "Number") "Number" "multiples one number by another")
   }

Note that `contracts` takes a list of arguments. Also note that
quoting each such argument removes the need to quote the
domain-list argument.

The directive `@showsoln` is similar to `@show` but renders
only
in solution pages.

The directive `@do` passes its argument to Racket, and renders
the standard output thereof. It is a general-purpose trapdoor into
Racket for things that are too difficult to do using regular
AsciiDoc and the standard directives. (That said, we haven't had
occasion to need it so far.)

==== Cross-references and pagination

There are a clutch of directives to allow easy cross-referencing between
pages in the converted document base.

The directive `@printable-exercise` is used to refer to pages
that are part of the workbook, e.g.,

  @printable-exercise{lessonA/pages/page.adoc, link text}

If `, link text` is not supplied, the title of the page is used.
The first and second components of the pathname may be dropped in certain
cases: `lessonA/` may be dropped if the reference is made within the
same lesson. In that case, the second component, if `pages/`, may also
be dropped. (The only other possible second component is
`solution-pages/`, which cannot be dropped.) The third component may
have extension `.pdf`, `.html`, or `.adoc`. If `.adoc`, it is resolved
to `.html`.

The directives `@opt-printable-exercise` and `@handout` are called the
same way, and are
applied to exercise pages not mentioned in the lesson's page list. (The
two are categorized differently in the collections appearing in the
pathway narrative.)

The directive `@lesson-link{...}` is a general-purpose link to any pages
within lessons, and uses pathnames relative to the
`distribution/<natlang>/lessons/` directory.

The directive `@dist-link{...}` uses pathnames relative to the
`distribution/<natlang>/`

==== Generic links

Use `@link{URL, link-text}` to refer to a generic URL
not part of the curriculum hierarchy.  The second argument for
the link text is optional.

==== Images

Use `@image{images/pic.png}` to insert the image `images/pic.png`.

An optional second argument gives the preferred width of the image.
Additional information about the image is retrieved from the
`images/lesson-images.json` file.

==== Comments

Comments can be inserted anywhere in the `.adoc` file as

  @comment{A comment}

Note that such comments _will be seen_ in the HTML source, which may be
exactly what you want, either for documentation or debugging.

If you don't want your comments to survive into the HTML, you may use
AsciiDoc's own commenting mechanism with `//` and `////` (see manual). While
these work mostly, their text is unfortunately subject to preprocessing for
directives, which may have consequences. To have truly inert comments, use

  @scrub{Everything within these braces is thoroughly scrubbed}

``@scrub``'s argument can contain plausible directives -- the only
requirement is that any braces within it should be paired. (This is
obviously needed to keep the extent of
``@scrub``'s argument recognizable.)

==== Conditional text

We sometimes need the same document to generate differing content in
different contexts, e.g., different target programming languages;
whether the page is in student- or solutions-mode; whether the page is
being converted into slide. We have a bunch of directives starting with
`@if...` that makes specifying this variation easier.

===== Programming-language specific text

Use the `@ifproglang` directive to conditonally include a
fragment text for a specific programming language. E.g.,

  @ifproglang{pyret}{
  This text occurs in the Pyret version of this document.
  }

  @ifproglang{wescheme}{
  This text occurs in the WeScheme version of this document.
  }

===== Slide-specific text

Lesson plan files are autoconverted to Google slides. To specify
that content should not be part of the slide:

  @ifnotslide{This content should not show up in the slide}

To specify that it should show up only in the slide:

  @ifslide{This content is slide-specific}

The slide converter will use the content of the lesson text to infer
the slide layout to use. While these heuristics may vary slightly over 
time, the general rules are:

- The slide layout will be partially determined by whether the text occurs within a Launch, Investigate, or Synthesize section
- @teacher{...} and "Common Misconceptions" will be auto converted into slide notes
- If the text has a right-aligned image, one of the "R" templates will be used
- If the text has a center-aligned image, one of the "C" templates will be used
- If the text has no image, one of the standard full-text templates will be used 


===== Student- vs solution mode

As described above, workbook pages get converted to both student and
solution versions. For content that should show up only in the student
version, use `@ifnotsoln`. For content that should show up only in
solutions mode, use `@ifsoln`.

We often have situations where a choice of answers is presented to the reader, but
the correct answer is identified only in solutions mode. Use
`@ifsoln-choice` to enclose this correct answer.

===== Pathway-specific text

As described above, a lesson can be picked up by different pathways.
Parts of a lesson file may be relevant only for certain pathways. Use

  @ifpathway{p1,p2,...}{text}

to specify that `text` should only be used
for the comma-separated list of pathways `p1, p2, ...`.

To specify that something should be used only for pathways that are
_not_ `p1, p2, ...`, use

  @ifnotpathway{p1,p2,...}{text}

===== Reusable text

When using `@if...` and `@ifnot...` pairs of conditional text, we may
often find that the controlled text nevertheless contains commonalities
that may be too tedious and/or error-prone to repeat. In such cases use
the `@define` directive to save reusable text in a dynamic directive,
and use call the directive (rather than repeat the reusable text)
whenever it needs to be used. E.g.,

  @define{savedtext}{... long piece of text ...}

  @ifslide{... slide-specific text containing @savedtext ...}
  @ifnoslide{.. non-slide text, also containing @savedtext ...}

==== Adding custom CSS classes

Some standard CSS classes to emphasize certain regions of text.

Add the class `.physics-table` to a table attribute to generate a
single-arg function
table, e.g., one that maps miles driven to cost.

You can add your own CSS classes or IDs. Classes are specified
with an initial dot and IDs with an initial `#`. Note that at
most one ID is meaningful, although any number of classes may be
specified. A combination of classes and ID are simply strung
together, e.g.,

   [.class1.class2.class3#onlyid]

The above works for blocks. Use `@span{classes and id}{text}` to
enclose CSS classes and/or an ID around arbitrary (i.e., in-line)
text. ``@span``s may be nested. `@span`’s first argument of
classes and ID is specified in the same way as for blocks,
without the brackets.
