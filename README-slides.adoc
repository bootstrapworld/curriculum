= Building slides

== Authentication

1. Create a directory `.md2googleslides` in your home directory.
+
----
  cd ~/
  mkdir .md2googleslides
----

2. Talk to Dorai! Ensure that he has added your preferred email
address is to the Google API settings, and then have him send you
the `client_id.json` file through a secure channel. Put this file
inside the `~/.md2googleslides` folder.

3. In your terminal window, _manually_ run md2gslides on a simple, dummy file.
+
----
  node node_modules/md2googleslides/bin/md2gslides lib/dummy-slides.md -n -t TITLE --use-fileio
----
+
This will generate some terminal output. The *first line* of the output looks something like
+
`Authorize this app by visiting this url:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline&scope=...`

4. Copy the _entire URL_ (it's quite long!) into a new browser window. This
will ask you to grant permission for `md2gslides` to construct google
slides for you, which requires two different permissions. Check both boxes
and continue. Eventually you will reach a web page that contains a code.

5. Copy that code, and paste it back into your terminal. This closes the loop
between md2gslides and Google, authenticating your computer. You're ready to rock!

== build-slide

The script `build-slide` is used to build the slides for an
individual lesson, whose name is supplied as its argument, e.g.,

  ./build-slide function-composition

This assumes that the lesson `function-composition` is
(or will be created) in the `distribution/**/lessons` directory.

`build-slide` converts the lessons's `slides.md` to a
post-processed `slides.mkd` (that expands out our
curriculum-specific directives) and then uses `md2gslides` to
construct and upload the corresponding presentation. If the
`repo`  does not already a presentation id associated with these
slides -- in the file `slides-pyret.id` say --, then a new id is
used and stored in the `slides-pyret.id`, and you are advised to
commit it to the repo, so that it can be reliably reused during
future calls to `build-slide`.

You can use some options to guide `build-slide`. The position of
these options on the `build-slide` argument line doesn't matter.

=== `-f` option

If `slides-pyret.id` is already present, then you are warned that
the current `build-slide` call could replace an existing
presentation on the web. Answer `y` to the prompt if that's what
you really want to do. If not, answer `n` to exit: You will then
be advised to use the `-f` option to create a new id that will
not dislodge the existing presentation.

Using the `-f` option is a good way to simply check that your
modified slides convert correctly without committing them to the
web yet.

=== `--rebuild` option

If you're cool with updating an existing presentation on the web,
and don't want a prompt asking for your confirmation, use the
`--rebuild` option.

=== `--proglang` option

The `build-slide` script takes as argument the name of a lesson
as it is in the `distribution` directory. For the default
proglang of `pyret`, this name is
the same as the name of the lesson in the repo. For other
proglangs, e.g., `wescheme`, the lesson directory inside
`distribution` sports the suffix `-wescheme`. `build-slide` called
with the suffixed lesson name will do the right thing, and will
copy the resultant `slides-wescheme.id` (not the suffix!) to the
correct lesson directory in the repo:

  build-slide function-composition-wescheme

If you prefer to use the lesson name as given in the repo even
for proglangs other than `pyret`, e.g., `wescheme`, you
may do so, provided you add the `--proglang wescheme` option:

  build-slide function-composition --proglang wescheme

It is ok to overspecify, i.e., to give the `--proglang` option
in addition to the proglang-modified name for the lesson as it
occurs in `distribution`:

  build-slide function-composition-wescheme --proglang wescheme

=== `--nomake` option

By default, `build-slide` calls `make` to ensure a proper
`distribution` folder before attempting to build slides for its
argument lesson.

However, if you're calling `build-slide` multiple times in quick
succession (perhaps within a shell loop), the `make` is redundant
except for the first time, and even a `make` that doesn't need to
update the `distribution` consumes valuable time. In such cases,
use the `--nomake` option to skip the `make`.

  build-slide --nomake function-composition

=== `--pd` option

The `--pd` option makes a `pd-slides.mkd` that has additional
material suited for a PD. The additional material is marked with
special directives that are ignored for regular HTML and non-PD
slides. (See below for the directives.)

== build-all-slides

`build-slide` builds the deck for a single argument lesson. To
build the slides for all lessons, use

  build-all-slides

To build the slides for all the lessons in a particular course,
e.g., algebra-pyret, use

  build-all-slides algebra-pyret

`build-all-slides` accepts the same options as `build-slide`:

- `-f` to make the slides without updating the currently public
  Google deck

- `--rebuild` to approve updating the currently public Google
  deck

- `--nomake` to avoid a sanity-check `make`. (Note however that
  if this option isn't given, `build-all-slides` will call
  `make`, but only once -- not once for each of the lessons that
  it processes. So failing to mention this option is not so
  terrible.)

== Slide syntax

=== Slide-specific directives

The lesson-plan adoc files are typically split into slides at the 2-level
sections, with the lower-level sections being ignored. An author
can insert their own slide-break with the directive
`@slidebreak`, which is a no-op as far as the regular HTML
generation is concerned or `@slidebreak{layout-name}` to specify a 
specific slide layout.

A final 1-level section, if it is named `Additional Exercises`, is
also converted to a slide.

PD slides are marked with `@pd-slide{...}` or
`@strategy{...}{...}` where the material is
inserted as a new slide, but only if the `--pd` option is used.

Note that introducing these in a final 1-level section
`Additional Exercise` implies this is no longer the final slide.
If you want to include a `@strategy` in such a slide, it's best
to use the primitives

  @ifpdslide{
    @strategy-basic{...}{...}
  }

as these don't introduce a tacit slidebreak. (The less verbose
directives `@pd-slide` and `@strategy` are built on top of
`@ifpdslide` and `@strategy-basic`.)

=== Unordered (aka bulleted) lists

Because of the difference between how AsciiDoc and Markdown
specify unordered lists, some care is needed when specifying them
in the lesson plan so they translate correctly to the slide.

==== AsciiDoc's unordered lists

AsciiDoc uses _two_ ways to specify the items in an unordered list.
Indentation does not matter:

- A sequence of ``++*++``'s followed by space(s) introduces an item. The
  number of ``++*++``'s indicates the depth of the item.

- A single `++*++`, `-`, or `•`, followed by space(s), introduces an
  item. An unordered list that uses a mix of these ornaments
  assigns a different depth (only 1, 2, or 3 are possible) to each of these, in
  text order. I.e., the first ornament used is at depth 1, the
  second (if any) at depth 2, and the third (if any) at depth 3.

==== Markdown's unordered lists

Markdown uses `-` followed by space(s) to introduce an item.
_Indentation matters!_ The number of spaces _before_ the `-`
identifies the depth: the more spaces, the more depth. The actual
number of spaces doesn't matter, only the relative order of their
number within the list.

==== How to write unordered lists in a lesson plan to satisfy slides

For depth-1 lists, write unordered lists in AsciiDoc however
you're comfortable: Use `++*++`, `-`, or `•` as you please. The
converter will convert to the correct Markdown. For nested lists,
however, for depths of 2 and above, use the multiple-`++*++` approach.
I.e., do not rely on using different symbols to signal different
depth.

===== `@QandA` with author lists inside them

The `@QandA`, `@Q`, `@A` lesson-plan directives sometimes imply an
implicit unordered list. However you don't need to keep this in
mind when inserting your own unordered lists within them. Start
with `++*++` for your first level, and increase the number of
`++*++`'s for more depth. 

It's all right to use `-` if you only have a flat list inside. For
lists with greater depth, use the multiple-`++*++` approach rather
than variable indentation with `-`.
