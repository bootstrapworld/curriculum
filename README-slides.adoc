= Building slides

== Authentication

1. Create a directory `.md2googleslides` in your home directory.
+
----
  cd ~/
  mkdir .md2googleslides
----

2. Talk to Dorai! Ensure that he has added your preferred email
address is to the Google API settings, and then have him send you
the `client_id.json` file through a secure channel. Put this file
inside the `~/.md2googleslides` folder.

3. In your terminal window, _manually_ run md2gslides on a simple, dummy file.
+
----
  node node_modules/md2googleslides/bin/md2gslides lib/dummy-slides.md -n -t TITLE --use-fileio
----
+
This will generate some terminal output. The *first line* of the output looks something like
+
`Authorize this app by visiting this url:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline&scope=...`

4. Copy the _entire URL_ (it's quite long!) into a new browser window. This
will ask you to grant permission for `md2gslides` to construct google
slides for you, which requires two different permissions. Check both boxes
and continue. Eventually you will reach a web page that contains a code.

5. Copy that code, and paste it back into your terminal. This closes the loop
between md2gslides and Google, authenticating your computer. You're ready to rock!

== build-slide

The script `build-slide` is used to build the slides for an
individual lesson, whose name is supplied as its argument, e.g.,

  ./build-slide function-composition

This assumes that the lesson `function-composition` is
(or will be created) in the `distribution/**/lessons` directory.

`build-slide` converts the lessons's `slides.md` to a
post-processed `slides.mkd` (that expands out our
curriculum-specific directives) and then uses `md2gslides` to
construct and upload the corresponding presentation. If the
`repo`  does not already a presentation id associated with these
slides -- in the file `slides-pyret.id` say --, then a new id is
used and stored in the `slides-pyret.id`, and you are advised to
commit it to the repo, so that it can be reliably reused during
future calls to `build-slide`.

You can use some options to guide `build-slide`. The position of
these options on the `build-slide` argument line doesn't matter.

=== `-f` option

If `slides-pyret.id` is already present, then you are warned that
the current `build-slide` call could replace an existing
presentation on the web. Answer `y` to the prompt if that's what
you really want to do. If not, answer `n` to exit: You will then
be advised to use the `-f` option to create a new id that will
not dislodge the existing presentation.

Using the `-f` option is a good way to simply check that your
modified slides convert correctly without committing them to the
web yet.

=== `--rebuild` option

If you're cool with updating an existing presentation on the web,
and don't want a prompt asking for your confirmation, use the
`--rebuild` option.

=== `--proglang` option

The `build-slide` script takes as argument the name of a lesson
as it is in the `distribution` directory. For the default
proglang of `pyret`, this name is
the same as the name of the lesson in the repo. For other
proglangs, e.g., `wescheme`, the lesson directory inside
`distribution` sports the suffix `-wescheme`. `build-slide` called
with the suffixed lesson name will do the right thing, and will
copy the resultant `slides-wescheme.id` (not the suffix!) to the
correct lesson directory in the repo:

  build-slide function-composition-wescheme

If you prefer to use the lesson name as given in the repo even
for proglangs other than `pyret`, e.g., `wescheme`, you
may do so, provided you add the `--proglang wescheme` option:

  build-slide function-composition --proglang wescheme

It is ok to overspecify, i.e., to give the `--proglang` option
in addition to the proglang-modified name for the lesson as it
occurs in `distribution`:

  build-slide function-composition-wescheme --proglang wescheme

=== `--nomake` option

By default, `build-slide` calls `make` to ensure a proper
`distribution` folder before attempting to build slides for its
argument lesson.

However, if you're calling `build-slide` multiple times in quick
succession (perhaps within a shell loop), the `make` is redundant
except for the first time, and even a `make` that doesn't need to
update the `distribution` consumes valuable time. In such cases,
use the `--nomake` option to skip the `make`.

  build-slide --nomake function-composition

=== `--pd` option

The `--pd` option makes a `pd-slides.mkd` that has additional
material suited for a PD. The additional material is marked with
special directives that are ignored for regular HTML and non-PD
slides. (See below for the directives.)

== build-all-slides

`build-slide` builds the deck for a single argument lesson. To
build the slides for all lessons, use

  build-all-slides

To build the slides for all the lessons in a particular course,
e.g., algebra-pyret, use

  build-all-slides algebra-pyret

`build-all-slides` accepts the same options as `build-slide`:

- `-f` to make the slides without updating the currently public
  Google deck

- `--rebuild` to approve updating the currently public Google
  deck

- `--nomake` to avoid a sanity-check `make`. (Note however that
  if this option isn't given, `build-all-slides` will call
  `make`, but only once -- not once for each of the lessons that
  it processes. So failing to mention this option is not so
  terrible.)

== Slide-specific directives

The lesson-plan adoc files are typically split into slides at the 2-level
sections, with the lower-level sections being ignored. An author
can insert their own slide-break with the directive
`@slidebreak`, which is a no-op as far as the regular HTML
generation is concerned or `@slidebreak{layout-name}` to specify a 
specific slide layout.

A final 1-level section, if it is named `Additional Exercises`, is
also converted to a slide.

PD slides are marked with `@pd-slide{...}` or
`@strategy{...}{...}` where the material is
inserted as a new slide, but only if the `--pd` option is used.

Note that introducing these in a final 1-level section
`Additional Exercise` implies this is no longer the final slide.
If you want to include a `@strategy` in such a slide, it's best
to use the primitives

  @ifpdslide{
    @strategy-basic{...}{...}
  }

as these don't introduce a tacit slidebreak. (The less verbose
directives `@pd-slide` and `@strategy` are built on top of
`@ifpdslide` and `@strategy-basic`.)
