= Building slides

== Authentication

1. Create a directory `.md2googleslides` in your home directory

----
  cd ~/
  mkdir .md2googleslides
----

2. Talk to Dorai! Ensure that he has added your preferred email
address is to the Google API settings, and then have him send you
the `client_id.json` file through a secure channel. Put this file
inside the `~/.md2googleslides` folder.

3. In your terminal window, _manually_ run md2gslides on a simple, dummy file.

----
  node node_modules/md2googleslides/bin/md2gslides lib/dummy-slides.md -n -t TITLE --use-fileio
----

This will generate some terminal output. The *first line* of the output looks something like

`Authorize this app by visiting this url:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline&scope=...`

2. Copy the _entire URL_ (it's quite long!) into a new browser window. This
will ask you to grant permission for `md2gslides` to construct google
slides for you, which requires two different permissions. Check both boxes
and continue. Eventually you will reach a web page that contains a code.

3. Copy that code, and paste it back into your terminal. This closes the loop
between md2gslides and Google, authenticating your computer. You're ready to rock!

== Subsequent uses

The script `build-slides` should be called after building a pathway (i.e.,
with a `distribution` directory populated with the built pathways
of your choice). This will build all the slides.md files in the
built lessons.

(The standard location for slides.md is in the lesson directory,
alongside its lesson plan adoc. It's ok if a lesson doesn't have
a slides.md.)

If a slides.md is being pushed to Google Slides for the first
time, a small file containing its Google presentation id is
created in your view of the repo (not just the `distribution`).
You will be encouraged to add it to your repo and push it so this
presentation id is used in perpetuity.  (If someone else has
already done it, you won't need to do it. You'll will just reuse
this presentation id.)

== build-slide

The script `build-slide` is used to build the slides for an
individual lesson, whose name is supplied as its argument, e.g.,

  build-slide function-composition

This assumes that the lesson `function-composition` has been
copied to the `distribution/` directory by a previous (any)
`make` call.

`build-slide` converts the lessons's `slides.md` to a
post-processed `slides.mkd` (that expands out our
curriculum-specific directives) and then uses `md2gslides` to
construct and upload the corresponding presentation. If the
`repo`  does not already a presentation id associated with these
slides -- in the file `slides-pyret.id` say --, then a new id is
used and stored in the `slides-pyret.id`, and you are advised to
commit it to the repo, so that it can be reliably reused during
future calls to `build-slides`.

If `slides-pyret.id` is already present, then you are warned that
the current `build-slides` call could replace an exising
presentation on the web. Answer `y` to the prompt if that's what
you really want to do. If not, answer `n` to exit: You are
advised to use the `-f` option to create a new id that will not
dislodge the existing presentation. Using the `-f` option is a
good way to simply check that your modified slides convert
correctly without committing them to the web yet.

===  `--proglang` option

The `build-slide` script takes as argument the name of a lesson
as it is in the `distribution` directory. For the default
proglang of `pyret`, this name is
the same as the name of the lesson in the repo. For other
proglangs, e.g., `wescheme`, the lesson directory inside
`distribution` sports the suffix `-wescheme`.  `build-slide` called
with the suffixed lesson name will do the right thing, and will
copy the resultant `slides-wescheme.id` (not the suffix!) to the
correct lesson directory in the repo:

  build-slide function-composition-wescheme

If you prefer to use the lesson name as given in the repo even
for proglangs other than `pyret`, e.g., `wescheme`, you
may do so, provided you add the `--proglang wescheme` option:

  build-slide function-composition --proglang wescheme

It is ok to overspecify, i.e., to give the `--proglang` option
in addition to the proglang-modified name for the lesson as it
occurs in `distribution`:

  build-slides function-composition-wescheme --proglang wescheme
