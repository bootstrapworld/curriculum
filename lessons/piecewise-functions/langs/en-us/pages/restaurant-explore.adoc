Alice's code has some new elements we haven't seen before, so let's experiment a bit to figure out how it works! *Open the “Alice's Restaurant starter file, click “Run”, and try using the `cost` function in the Interactions window.*

@vspace{2ex}

@n What does @show{(sexp->code '(cost "hamburger"))} evaluate to?
@fitb{30ex}{@ifsoln{_6_}}


@n What does @show{(sexp->code '(cost "pie"))} evaluate to?
@fitb{30ex}{@ifsoln{_2.25_}}


@n What if you ask for @show{(sexp->code '(cost "fries"))}?
@fitb{30ex}{@ifsoln{__"Sorry, that's not on the menu!"__}}


@n Explain what the function is doing in your own words.

@n What is the function's name? @fitb{20ex}{@ifsoln{cost}}
Domain? @fitb{20ex}{@ifsoln{String}} Range? @fitb{20ex}{@ifsoln{Number}}


@n What is the name of its variable?
@fitb{30ex}{@ifsoln{menu-item}}


@n Alice says onion rings have gone up to $3.75. Change the `cost` function to reflect this.


@n Try adding menu items of your own. What's your favorite?


@n For an unknown food item, the function produces the String `"That's not on the menu!"` Is this a problem? Why or why not?

@n Suppose Alice wants to calculate the price of a hamburger, _including a 5% sales tax_. Draw a Circle of Evaluation for the expression below.

@ifsoln{@show{(sexp->coe `(* 1.05 (cost "hamburger")))}}
