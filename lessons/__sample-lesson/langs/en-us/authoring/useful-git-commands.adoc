= Git Command Notes for Authors

== Commits

@n `git add lessons/.../langs/en-us/.../...`

@n `git commit -m "[DS] briefly describe the commit here (see #xxx)"`

	* The brackets at the beginning of the quoted phrase are optional. They tag a branch: `[math]`, `[DS]`, `[core]`, `[codap]` or `[OK]`.
	* The parentheses at the back are optional. They associate the commit with a git issue.

=== To cancel a commit before you push - Useful when you forget to include the git issue and want the chance to change the words in the commit.

	* `git reset HEAD~1`
	* You can unstage multiple commits by repeating `git reset HEAD~1` or using `git reset HEAD~2` or `git reset HEAD~3`

== Renaming or moving files

	* `git mv lessons/contracts/langs/en-us/pages/graphs.adoc lessons/flags/langs/en-us/tables.adoc`
	* The example code above both moves and renames the file.
		- If you just want to rename it, don't change the location.
		- If you just want to move it, don't change the name of the asciidoc.
	* If you haven't committed the file yet, you can just click on it in sublime or in your finder window and change the name of the file there.

== Making new files

	* `cp lessons/contracts/langs/en-us/pages/graphs.adoc lessons/flags/langs/en-us/tables.adoc`
	* This is useful when you want to make a new page with formatting similar to a page from another lesson.
	* To copy an entire lesson, use `cp -r` instead of just `cp`

== Building Pathways

	* `./build-pathway` will build all of the pathways
	* You can get `./build-pathway` to appear by typing `./bu` and `tab`
	* To specify pathways use:
 		- `./build-pathway data-science`
 		- `./build-pathway data-science --proglang codap`
 		- `./build-pathway algebra`
 		- `./build-pathway algebra --proglang wescheme`
 		- `./build-pathway algebra --proglang pyret`
 		- `./build-pathway __sample`
	* When working intensively with one lesson it is often most efficient to go to `pathways/langs/en-us/lesson-order.txt`, add the lesson to the file and save it, and then `./build-pathway __sample`
	* If you want to see the pdf version add `--book`
	* If it's not building all of your changes:
		- delete the lesson from the distribution folder in your directory
		- use `-f` or `-F` to force it rebuild the pathway from scratch. It doesn't matter where you put the `-f` or `-F` in the command line.
		- in extreme cases where Dorai has made big changes to the system, delete your entire distribution before building

== Changing Directories

	* `cd lessons/.../langs/en-us/.../...`
	* `cd` or `cd ~` goes to your home directory
	* `cd ..` goes up a level
	* `cd ../..` goes up two levels

== Comparing directories for changes

	* `git diff --name-status "@{1 month ago}" "@{0 days ago}" | grep '^A'`
	* You can do something like `git log --since="September 1, 2020" --name-only | grep adoc`   to get all the adoc files modified since that time.  You should also be able to use phrases like `--since="2 months ago"` or `--until="2 weeks ago"`

== Switching Branches

	* `git checkout fall2022` will take you to the branch `fall2022` if it already exists
	* `git checkout master` will take you back to the main branch.
	* If someone else just made a new branch, use `git fetch origin` to make it known to your computer.
