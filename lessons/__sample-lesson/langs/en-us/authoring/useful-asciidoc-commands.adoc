= Asciidoc Command Notes for New Authors - read (at least in part) as an asciidoc

== Don't be afraid to ask!

	* Sometimes it's way more efficient to post a question to the curriculum remix team
	* It might also be true that your work will surface a bug in something somebody else did and you won't be able to solve the problem alone!

=== Some files have commented notes to authors at the top because our system has layers and is dependent on other systems, which sometimes require work arounds.

The one that seems to work the best is:

@comment{}

But you will also see:

// comments out a section

////
comments out lines of code in between
////



=== Heads up!

Some asciidoc files use multiple languages! asciidoc, css, racket, mathjax...

== Text formatting

=== Style

- *bold*
- _italics_

[.underline]underline
[.underline]"if you want to underline more than one word, put the phrase in quotes"

@show{(sexp->code 'code)}
@show{(sexp->code '(coded sentences with "punctuation"))}
We are trying to write all functions using `sexp->code` ...
It's special Dorai wizardry that will
- take whatever we write in racket and automatically translate it into pyret if the document is opened in a pyret version
- autogenerate a list of functions used in the lesson plan and accompanying pages for a language prerequisites table
- who knows what other fabulous things it will do by the time you're reading this ;)

Widespread use of `sexp` in lesson plans is relatively recent, so you will also see code written like this.
- `code`
_``code`` at the beginning of an italicized sentence_

Feel free to update expressions you encounter to use `sexp->code`!
(And to use the alternate version of formatting code in text when wanting to format code that is outside the bounds of what `sexp` is used for.)


Vocab words like @vocab{variable} get flagged using the @comment{@vocab{}} directive when they are:

@n focal to the lesson and

@n focal to the sentence you're using it in.

_If you flag a word as a vocabulary word, be sure to add it to the glossary in both plural and singular form. The glossary is found in the curriculum directory (shared is at the same level as lessons and within that you will find glossary-terms.rkt)_

=== Size

- all sizes in bootstrap are written in `rem` not `pt` (10 pt = 1.1em) so that changes to the system as a whole can happen without having to rework font sizes on each section of each page individually.
- rem stands for relative em (em is a unit equivalent to the width of the letter "m")

== Formatting parts of the page

=== To center text horizontally on the line

[.center]
this text will be centered

=== Vertical spaces between lines of text

Vertical space is measured in "ex" (a unit equivalent to the height of the letter x.)
@vspace{1ex}

=== Fill in the Blank lines for students to write on

Width is measured in "em" (a unit equivalent to the width of the letter "m")
@fitb{30em}{if you want text to appear on the line, type it here}
@fitb{30em}{} whether or not you want something on the line you have to include the second set of brackets or it will break the build

@span{.right}{@fitb{60ex}{}}

This makes a line that fills the whole width of the page:
@span{.blankline}{}

=== Horizontal space between words on the same line

If you need significant space between words @quad{15em} will create that gap.

=== Links

These 4 directives are for links that appear in the lesson plan and should be auto-included in the list of materials at the start of the lesson plan.  (See comments in asciidoc)

_Note: What is included in the workbook is determined by what is listed in the workbook-pages.txt file in the lesson's "pages" folder._

@comment{
- @printable-exercise{pages/whateverthepagetitleis.adoc} This is for workbook pages only and will automatically be shown with the title and the page number in the lesson plan.
- @opt-printable-exercise{pages/whateverthepagetitleis.adoc} This is for pages that can be printed but are not going to be included in the workbook. W
- @online-exercise{whateverthelink is} or  @online-exercise{whateverthelink is, however you want the link to be named in the lesson plan}. This link is designed for things that we expect all teachers to use while teaching the lesson
- @opt-online-exercise{whateverthelink is} This link is desinged for things that some people may use.

Lesson slides and other external links can also be linked using @link{}
}

=== Bullet points

- can be written like this using hyphens
- and it's important to leave a space after the dash
- and a blank line before the first line of the list

* They can also be
* written using
* asterisks

@n we have a special autonumbering command that will

@n keep numbering top to bottom

@n even if you go in and out of a table or other formatting

@n but it's new

. so you will see
. some pages that are
. numbered like this instead
. if you have energy, switch them to our new numbering command


=== Tables

In the code below, cols= could also be defined more simply as 4,2,3,1.

You can change the numbers to shift the ratio of the width of the columns and add or subtract numbers to increase or decrease the number of colummsn.

The other formatting defines where in the cell the words end up being placed (see alignment notes below)

[cols="^.^4,<.^2,>.>3, 1" options="header", stripes="none"]
|===
| each vertical | bar 		| is 		| a
| break 		| between 	| columns	| .
|===

==== Aligning text within the table

- without a dot, we mean horizontal alignment.
- With a dot, it's vertical alignment.
- < means to the left (horizontally) or top (vertically).
- ^ is center (horizontally or vertically)
- > pushes to the right (horizontally) or bottom (vertically).
- ^.^ centers both horizontally & vertically

==== Inerting a table within a table
[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
| add a to the column width to let asciidoc know to look out for something complicated
| and
| use exlamation points instead of vertical bars to indicate the column breaks of the nested table
|  [cols="1a,1a"]
!===
! this 	! part
! is 	! nested
!===
|===


=== Programming Language specific content

When possible, use Dorai the Wizard's Special Code that automatically converts code you write into the correct programming language for the pathway.

@show{(sexp->code '(text "Math is fun!" 30 "red"))}

There are language specific commands (see asciidoc file):

- @ifproglang{wescheme}{}
- @ifproglang{pyret}{}

There are also pathyway specific commands, which we only use sparingly to include optional pages in core materials (see asciidoc file):

- @ifpathway{data-science}{}

=== Indentation
You can use

[.indentedpara]
--
and whatever you write in here will be indented
--

=== Landscape pages

_see comment_

@comment{
[.landscape] in the first line of the file makes it landscape
}

=== Special symbols can be included using unicode
