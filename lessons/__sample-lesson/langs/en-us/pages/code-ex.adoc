= How to use `code`

`code` takes an s-expression `S` and then depending on the
prevailing value of `PROGLANG`, renders `S` as either a Pyret or
a WeScheme code fragment. E.g.,

@show{(code '(+ 1 2))}

You can use `(?ANS e)` inside `S`. This will render as an
unfilled fill-in-the-blank of suitable length in the student
version, and as filled fill-in-the-blank (filled with `e`) in the
solution version. E.g.,

@show{(code `(+ (?ANS 1) 2))}

You can use `(?FITB L)` inside `S`. This specifies a permanent
fill-in-the-blank of length `L` in both the student and solution
versions. E.g.,

@show{(code `(+ (?FITB 4ex) 2))}

The length `L` is any valid CSS length, just like the first
argument to the directive `@fitb{...}{...}`.
