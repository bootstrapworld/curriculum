@n On the line below, *write the Code* to define `PRIZE-STAR` as a pink, outline star of size 65.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(define PRIZE-STAR (star 65 "outline" "pink"))) }}

@vspace{1ex}

Using the `PRIZE-STAR` definition from above, draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the Code for each of the exercises. Test out your code before moving onto the next item. One Circle of Evaluation has been done for you.

@n How does defining values help you as a programmer?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{More efficient. Avoids mistakes. Easier to make changes. Easier to read the code.}}
