@n In the code below, highlight or circle all instances of the expression that makes the repeated image. +

@n Write the code to define a value for the repeated expression.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(define yellow-star (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))) }}

@n Open the @starter-file{flags-china} and click "Run". +

** Type `china` into the Interactions Area and click *Enter*.
** *Save a copy* of the file, and simplify the flag code using the value you defined.
** Click "Run", and confirm that you still get the same image as the original.
** Now change the color of all of the stars to black, in both files.
** Then change the size of the stars.

@n Why is it helpful to define values for repeated images?


@fitb{}{@ifsoln{More efficient. Avoids mistakes. Easier to make changes. Easier to read the code.}}

*Challenge:*

- This file uses a function we havenâ€™t seen before! What is it? @fitb{}{@showsoln{"_put-image_" }}

- Can you figure out its contract? _Hint: Focus on the last instance of the function._

@fitb{}{@showsoln{"_put-image {two-colons} Image, Number, Number, Image -> Image_" }}
