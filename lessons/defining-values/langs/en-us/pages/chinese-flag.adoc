@centered-image{../images/china-flag.png, Chinese Flag. Red rectangle with a large yellow star in the top left corner and an arc of 4 smaller yellow stars to the right of the big star}

@n What image do you see repeated in the flag? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_small yellow stars_}}

@n Highlight or circle all instances of the structure that makes the repeated image in the code below. +

@n In the code below, highlight or circle all instances of the expression for that image. +
  @ifsoln{_students should highlight or circle:_} @showsoln{(code '(star 15 "solid" "yellow")) }


@ifproglang{wescheme}{@centered-image{../images/china-code-wescheme.png, China code WeScheme}}
@ifproglang{pyret}{@centered-image{../images/china-code-pyret.png, China code Pyret}}


@n Write the code to define a value for the repeated expression.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(define yellow-star (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))) }}

@n Open the @ifproglang{wescheme}{
@online-exercise{https://www.wescheme.org/open/editor?publicId=Gc01ngfMN0, Chinese flag starter file.}
} @ifproglang{pyret}{
@online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1zfp_NOVn5MU6CBX7_r6U1zYwseNzZw06&v=04918ef, Chinese flag starter file}
} and click Run. +
Then type `china` into the interactions area and click *Enter*.

@n *Save a copy* of the file, and simplify the flag code using the value you defined. Click Run, and confirm that you still get the same image as the original.

@n Now change the color of all of the stars to black, in both files. Then change the size of the stars.

@n Why is it helpful to define values for repeated images?

*Challenge:*

- This file uses a function we havenâ€™t seen before! What is it? @fitb{}{@showsoln{"_put-image_" }}

- Can you figure out its contract? _Hint: Focus on the last instance of the function._

@fitb{}{@showsoln{"_put-image {two-colons} Image, Number, Number, Image -> Image_" }}
