= Defining Values

In math, we use *values* like @math{-98.1}, @math{2/3} amd @math{42}. In math, we also use *expressions* like @math{1 \times 3}, @math{\sqrt{16}}, and @math{5 - 2}. These evaluate to results, and typing any of them in as code produces some answer.

@vspace{1ex}

Math also has *definitions*. These are different from values and expressions, because they __they do not produce results__. Instead, they simply create names for values, so that those names can be re-used to make the Math simpler and more efficient.

@vspace{1ex}

Definitions always have both a name and an expression. The name goes on the left and the value-producing expression goes on the right, separated by an equals sign:

@math{x = 4}

@math{y = 9 + x}

@vspace{1ex}

The name is defined to be the result of evaluating the expression. Using the above examples, we get "x is defined to be 4, and y is defined to be 13". **Important: there is no "answer" to a definition**, and typing in a definition as code will produce no result.

@vspace{1ex}

Notice that __definitions can refer to previous definitions__. In the example above, the definition of `y` refers to `x`. But `x`, on the other hand, _cannot_ refer to `y`. Once a value has been defined, it can be used in later expressions.

@ifproglang{pyret}{
In Pyret, these definitions are written the __exact same way__:
}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
In WeScheme, these definitions are written a little differently, making it clear that we're talking about definitions:
}

Try typing these definitions into the Definitions Area on the left, clicking "Run", and then _using_ them in the Interactions Area on the right.

@show{(code '(define x 4))}

@show{(code '(define y (+ 9 x)))}

@vspace{1ex}

Just like in math, definitions in our programming language can only refer to previously-defined values.

@vspace{1ex}

Here are a few more value definitions. Feel free to type them in, and make sure you understand them.

@show{(code '(define x (+ 5 1)) )}

@show{(code '(define y (* x 7)) )}

@show{(code '(define food "Pizza!") )}

@show{(code '(define dot (circle y "solid" "red")) )}
