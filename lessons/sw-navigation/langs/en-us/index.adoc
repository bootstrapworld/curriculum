=== Overview

=== Launch

We have learned that ships traded Chinese goods. That means that ships must have traveled between China and the other countries near where shipwrecks happened. How did ships find their way from one port to another?

Imagine that you were in the middle of the ocean on a ship. In every direction, all you can see is water. How might you know which direction to sail in order to reach a specific port? Traveling along the coasts might seem easier than traveling across the open sea. But the open sea could be faster, and less rocky.

Around the 1100s, the Chinese invented a tool called a “maritime compass”. This compass allowed them to navigate across the open sea without getting lost. Europeans didn’t use compasses until about 400 years later.
