= Project: Stress or Chill?

== The issue

People report being more and more stressed every day.  This trend is extending beyond adults, and is being reported by children and teenagers.  The amount of work people are responsible for has been increasing.  To understand what makes us feel stressed, some important questions to ask are:

. What factors affect my stress/chill level?
. Do different personality types have different things that make them happy/sad?
. Do you like to be alone or with people?
. Is your stress/chill level a function of the environment in which you find yourself?


== Objective

Students will analyze stress data and Personality Color data to answer these questions: 
. Do color personalities really predict a person’s personality?
. Do people with different personality colors tend to have different stress levels?
. What is the typical stress/chill level of the class across this project?
. What is my typical stress/chill level and how does it compare to the whole class?
. Do the stress/chill levels vary by weekday or weekend, or by the type of people you are with?
. Under which conditions is my stress/chill level affected?


== Procedure

Record your daily information on this sheet, and then enter it into our class Google Sheet.  Link will be posted in Classroom.  Use your initials with numbers.  As is possible, take a photo of what you are doing at each time slot. Take the @link{personality-colors.pdf, Personality True Colors assessment}. Calculate your personality type.  Enter your personality type in the column of the Google Sheet for each of your entries.  

== Survey questions

Use a random number generator to generate 2 random times a day for the next 5 days, including a weekend.  If a time falls within the school day, it is up to the discretion of the teacher to allow you to jot down your entry then or you will need to make a mental note and jot it down as soon as you can.

== Produce

Write a two-page report to address these research questions listed under the objective section.  Your data analysis should include both numerical methods (means, medians, etc.) and graphical methods (plots).   Use Pyret to produce these graphs (plots).

In your report, be sure to:

- Provide the plot(s) and numerical summary (or summaries).
- Describe what the plot shows.
- Explain why you chose to make that particular plot.
- Explain how the plot and numerical summary answers your statistical question.  
- Explain conclusions you made from your analysis.
- Present your report to another student in the class to get feedback.  Then make final edits before turning in the paper.
