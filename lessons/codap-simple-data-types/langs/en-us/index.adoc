| Key Points For The Facilitator

== Numbers & Strings @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students experiment with CODAP. They explore Number and String data types, and investigate how these data types behave in CODAP.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/driver-navigator.png, "Driver/Navigator", 150, ""}}
When programming in this class, you'll be working together using the _Driver/Navigator_ model. Each group can only have one "Driver" - their hands are on the keyboard, and their job is to manage the typing, clicking, shortcuts, etc. If you're not a Driver, you're a "Navigator" - your job is to tell the Driver where to go, what to type, etc. A good Driver types only what the Navigator tells them to, and a good Navigator makes sure to give clear and precise instructions.

@span{.title}{The Driver/Navigator Model}

This model of pair programming is extremely useful for teasing apart the "thinking" step from the "typing" one. Students - especially those who are new to text-based programming or typing itself - can struggle to put their thoughts into the programming environment. This model allows them to focus on _communicating their ideas_, but letting the Driver focus on the coding. Likewise, the Driver has a chance to focus on syntax and programming. Finally, the requirement that ideas are translated through another person's hands is an excellent scaffold for getting students talking about their thinking and about code.

Students should open the @starter-file{animals} in CODAP. Then, invite them to play in CODAP! Challenge students to do the following:

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Make a graph
- Move a table or graph
- Drag an attribute (like weight, name, or sex) to a graph's axis.
- Drag a 2nd attribute to a graph's axis.
- Add an attribute to the table called `test`
--

Debrief with students, then ensure that they all have created a blank column titled `test`. They can do so by selecting the grey plus sign (`+`) in the upper right-hand corner of the Animals Table. *NEED SCREENSHOT*

=== Investigate

In their `test` column, students will experiment with _numbers_ and _strings_. In order to complete the worksheet below, students must first select `test` on their Table and then choose `Edit formula` from the drop-down menu that appears. For each directive on the worksheet below, students must re-open the `Edit Formula` box, delete their entry - and then input the next entry. *NEED SCREENSHOT*

[.lesson-instruction]

Have students complete @printable-exercise{numbers-n-strings.adoc}. Ask them to pay special attention to the error messages!

- What did you Notice? What do you Wonder?
- Did you get any error messages? What did you learn from them? _Most of the error messages we've just seen were drawing our attention to @vocab{syntax errors}: Missing commas, unclosed strings, etc._
--

=== Synthesize
CODAP knows about many types of numbers, and they behave pretty much the way they do in math. Discuss what students have learned:

- Numbers and Strings evaluate to themselves.
- CODAP converts fractions into decimals automatically.
- Anything in quotes is a String, even something like `"42"`.
- Strings _must_ have quotation marks on both sides.
- Operators work just like they do in math - with a few exceptions. The `+`, for instance, will join together two strings, or a number and a string.
- CODAP knows the order of operations.
- Types matter! We can subtract one number from another, but we can't subtract the Number `4` from the String `"hello"`.

Error messages are a way for CODAP to explain what went wrong, and are a helpful way of finding mistakes. Emphasize how useful they can be, and why students should read those messages out loud before asking for help. Have students see the following errors:

- `6 / 0`. In this case, CODAP obeys the same rules as humans, and gives an error.
- `(2 + 2`. An unclosed quotation mark is a problem, and so is an unmatched parentheses.

== Booleans @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
This lesson introduces students to Booleans, a unique data type with only two values: "true" and "false", and why they are useful in both the real world and the programming environment.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
What's the answer: is 3 greater than 10?

Boolean-producing expressions are yes-or-no questions and will always evaluate to either `true` (“yes”) or `false` (“no”).  The ability to separate inputs into two categories is unique and quite useful!

For example, some rollercoasters with loops require passengers to be a minimum height to make sure that riders are safely held in place by the one-size-fits all harnesses. The gate keeper doesn't care exactly how tall you are, they just check whether you are as tall as the mark on the pole. If you are, you can ride, but they don't let people on the ride who are shorter than the mark because they can't keep them safe.  Similarly, when you log into your email, the computer asks for your password and checks whether it matches what's on file. If the match is `true` it takes you to your messages, but, if what you enter doesn't match, you get an error message instead.

[.lesson-instruction]
Brainstorm other scenarios where Booleans are useful in and out of the programming environment.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
--
In pairs, students complete @printable-exercise{pages/booleans.adoc}, making predictions about what a variety of Boolean expressions will return and testing them in the editor.
--

=== Synthesize
Debrief student answers as a class.

[.lesson-instruction]
What sets Booleans apart from other data types?

== Applying Functions @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to apply functions CODAP, reinforcing concepts from standard Algebra.

=== Launch
Students know about Numbers, Strings, Booleans and Operators -- all of which behave just like they do in math. But what about @vocab{functions}? Students may remember functions from algebra: @math{f(x) = x + 4}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- What is the name of this function? _f_
- The expression @math{f(2)} applies the function @math{f} to the number 2. What will it evaluate to? _6_
- What will the expression @math{f(3)} evaluate to? _7_
- The values to which we apply a function are called its @vocab{arguments}. How many arguments does @math{f} expect? _1_

@vocab{Arguments} (or "inputs") are the values passed into a function. This is different from @vocab{variables}, which are the placeholders that get _replaced_ with input values! CODAP has lots of built-in functions, which we can use to play with our dataset.

In their `test` column, have students type `sqrt(16)`.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- What is the name of this function? `sqrt`
- How many arguments does the function expect? _1_
- What type of argument does the function expect? _Number_
- Does the `sqrt` function produce a Number? String? Boolean? _Number_
- What did the expression evaluate to? _4_
--
What happens if we apply `sqrt` to an attribute (column), rather than a number?

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Enter `sqrt(Weight)`
- What do you observe?
- How about `sqrt(Legs)`?
- What happens when we enter `sqrt(Name)`?
--

Have students type `stringLength("rainbow")` into the interactions area and hit `Enter`. Next try `stringLength(Name)`

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- What is the name of this function? _stringLength_
- How many arguments does `stringLength` expect? _1_
- What type of argument does the function expect? _String_
- What does the expression evaluate to? _7_
- Does the `stringLength` function produce a Number? String? Boolean? _Number_
--

=== Investigation

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Create a column called `AgeNextYear` that uses a function to add one year to each animal’s age.
- Create a column called `RoundedWeight` that uses a function to give the weight of each animal rounded to the nearest whole number.
- Create a column called `Old` that uses a function to indicate which animals are  over 5 years old.
--



=== Synthesize
Debrief the activity with the class.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Think about the new columns you created using functions. How did the input of the function relate to the output?
- What kind of error messages did you encounter, if any?
