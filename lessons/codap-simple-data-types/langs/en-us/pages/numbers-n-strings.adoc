= Numbers and Strings

Make sure youâ€™re logged into CODAP, and have created a new column titled `test` in the Animals Dataset. In order to follow each of these directives, you must first select `test`, and then choose `Edit formula` from the drop-down menu that appears. You will be typing into the `Edit Formula` box.

== Numbers

@n Try typing `42` and then select `Apply`.  What happens? What is the largest number CODAP can handle?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_I didn't find a number that was too big!_}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What happens if you try a fraction like `1/3`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_The editor will return the decimal equivalent._}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Try writing negative integers, fractions and decimals.

== Strings

String values are always in quotes.

@n Try typing your name in the `Formula` box. What error message appears? Why do you think it appears?

@n Try typing your name in quotes.

@n Try typing your name with the opening quote, but _without the closing quote._ Read the error message!

@n Is `42` the same as `"42"`? Why or why not? Write your answer below:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_No. 42 is a number and "42" is a string._}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Explain what you understand about how strings work in CODAP.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Strings require quotes._}}

@fitb{}{}

== Operators

@n Just like math, CODAP has @vocab{operators} like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` and `^`. Try typing in `4 + 2`.

@n Type in and apply the following expressions, one at a time: `4 + 2 * 6`, `(4 + 2) * 6`, `4 + (2 * 6)`. What do you notice? Does CODAP know the order of operations?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Yes, CODAP automatically applies the order of operations._}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Try typing in `4 + "cat"`, and then `"dog" + "cat"`. What can you conclude from this?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_You can use `+` to combine two strings, and you can even combine a number and a string!_}}

@fitb{}{}
