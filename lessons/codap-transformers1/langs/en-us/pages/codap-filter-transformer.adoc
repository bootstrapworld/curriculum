== Creating a "Filter" Transformer (Guided)

Open the Transformers plugin, and select `Filter`.

@n Enter `filter-is-dog` as the name. What does this name tell you about the Transformer you are creating? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The Transformer will keep only animals that are dogs, and filter out the rest.}}

@n Which dataset should we select, to apply this Transformer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Animals Dataset}}

@n Examine the contract. Its input - or domain - is a Row. Explain why that makes sense.@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When we filter, we walk look at each row, one by one.}}


@n Now, take a look at the output - or range - of the contract. It is a Boolean. Why does that make sense? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are going to determine if the formula is true or false for each row.}}

@n A purpose statement explains the purpose of the expression. A good rule for purpose statements is to structure them like this: "The expression *_consumes_* one thing and *_produces_* another thing." With your class, write a purpose statement for this expression.

@n Enter `Species = "dog"` as the expression. Select `Apply Transformer`. What happens? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A copy of the original dataset is created, with only dogs!}}

@n Think of a scenario where you might need a table like this. How might it be useful? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Try typing `species = "dog"` as the expression (instead of `Species = "dog"`). What happens? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_An error message appears that says, "Evaluating `species = "dog"` failed: 'species' is unrecognized."_}}

@n What are some other possible reasons you might get an error message for the expression? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Incorrect spelling, wrong capitalization, forgetting quotation marks._}}

@vspace{2ex}

== More Filtering (Independent)

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-old` that creates a new dataset with animals older than 5 years. How many rows does the resulting table have?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_There are 9 rows._}}

@n Did you notice anything different as you created `filter-is-old`? For instance, how many datasets appeared in the drop-down menu for you to choose from? How did you decide which dataset to select?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There were two datasets - the one with only dogs, and the original animals dataset. I chose the original animals dataset.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-fixed` that creates a new dataset with only fixed animals. How fixed animals are there at the shelter?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_There are 18._}}
