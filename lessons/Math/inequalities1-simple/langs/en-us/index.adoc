| Key Points for the Facilitator
|* A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images.  But unlike those types, there are only _two_ values: `true` and `false`. While simple to explain, this different behavior can be confusing for some students.
* Boolean-producing functions are essentially yes-or-no questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions.

* For example, @show{(code 'odd?)} and @show{(code 'even?)} @ifproglang{wescheme}{(pronounced "odd-huh?" and "even-huh?" in Scheme)} are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.

== Introducing Booleans @duration{20 minutes}

=== Launch
Students should be logged into @starter-file{editor}.

Ask students to evaluate Circles of Evaluation for simple expressions they've seen before, and ask them to convert them into code.

- @show{(coe '(+ 1 2))}
- @show{(coe '(- 4 5))}
- @show{(coe '(* 8 0))}

Then show them unfamiliar Circles of Evaluation, and ask them to hypothesize what they think they mean, what they will evaluate to, and what the code would look like.

- @show{(coe '(> 1 2))}
- @show{(coe '(< 4 5))}
- @show{(coe '(= 8 0))}

Have students convert these Circles to code and type them in. What did they evaluate to? What do they think the outputs mean?

Values like `true` and `false` obviously aren't Numbers or Images. But they also aren't Strings, or else they would have quotes around them. We've found a __new data type__, called a @vocab{Boolean}.

=== Investigate


Have students open the @starter-file{boolean}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Explore the five functions in this starter file: @show{(code 'odd?)}, @show{(code 'even?)}, @show{(code 'less-than-one?)}, @show{(code 'continent?)}, and @show{(code 'primary-color?)}
- All five functions produce @vocab{Booleans}. Through your exploration, see if you can come up with an explanation of what a @vocab{Boolean} is.

[.lesson-point]
A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images. But unlike the others there are only two values: `true` and `false`.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{boolean-functions.adoc} and use the starter file to complete the questions, identifying inputs that will make each function produce `true`, and inputs that will make each function `false`.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Many students - especially traditionally high-achieving ones - will be very concerned about writing examples that are "wrong." The misconception here is that an expression that produces `false` is somehow _incorrect_. You can preempt this by explaining that our Boolean-producing functions _should sometimes return false_.

=== Synthesize
- Students will see functions on this page that they've never encountered before! But instead of answering their questions, encourage them to make a _guess_ about what they do, and then type it in to discover for themselves.
- Explicitly point out that _everything they know still works!_ They can use their reasoning about Circles of Evaluation and Contracts to figure things out.

== Introducing Inequalities @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover (or expand their understanding of) inequalities by identifying solutions and non-solutions and connecting expressions to graphic representations.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
How are equations different from inequalities?

@vocab{Equations} typically have finite solution sets: there's only one answer for an unknown, or perhaps several answers. @vocab{Inequalities}, on the other hand, can have _infinite_ solutions.  Inequality expressions divide all of the numbers in the universe into two categories: solutions and non-solutions.

_It is important that students learn to recognize that there are many possible solutions and non-solutions to an inequality and are able to identify whether or not a given number is or isn't part of the @vocab{solution set}._


[.lesson-instruction]
- We are going to practice identifying whether or not a given number is part of the @vocab{solution set}.
- Open the @starter-file{inequalities-simple} and click "Run".
- Look at the graph that appears (image below), as well as the provided code (lines 10, 18, and 26).
@image{images/inequality-works.png}
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

Students might observe the following:

* This starter file includes a special `inequality` function that takes in a function __(which tests numbers in an inequality)__ and a list of 8 numbers __(to test in the function)__.

* When we click "Run", we see a graph of the inequality on a number line.

* The solution set is shaded in blue.

* The 8 numbers provided in the list are shown as dots on the numberline. They will appear:
** green _when they're part of the solution set_
** red _when they are non-solutions_

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at line 18. Edit the list of values by deleting _one_ of the `-` symbols.
- Hit "Run". Examine the graph that appears (sample image below).
@image{images/not-quite2.png}
- How is this graph different from the one you first produced?

A successful input in this starter file will include 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions; in other words, the image returned will show 4 green dots and 4 red dots.

When students modify the list of numbers, they will see there are now 5 red dots and 4 green dots - along with a message that says, _"Challenge yourself: Find 4 true examples and 4 false"_.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open to the @printable-exercise{simple-inequalities.adoc} and complete it with a partner, identifying solutions and non-solutions to each inequality and testing them in the @starter-file{inequalities-simple}.
- For each inequality, you must find four solutions and four non-solutions.
- Try using negatives, positives, fractions and decimals as you generate your lists.

=== Synthesize
- What patterns did you observe in how the inequalities worked?
