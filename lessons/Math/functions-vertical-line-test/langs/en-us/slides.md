# The Vertical Line Test 

<!--

* Decide whether you want to have students interact directly with the @link{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IW5uMg491e33Av_XdGSivsAy28S9QSVivEYonpjTeF8/edit?usp=sharing, Interactive Function Activity} on their computers or whether it would be easier for your situation to project each graph from the peardeck on the white board and have students come up to add points that satisfy the rules or dictate points that satisfy the rules to a scribe who will add them to the graph.
* Rulers or straight edges might be useful in supporting students during the section of the lesson that focuses on the vertical line test.

* To learn more about how to use PearDeck, and how to view the embedded links on these slides without going into present mode visit https://help.peardeck.com/en

# Functions Are Reliable

Functions are reliable. If we give them what they need, they produce the same thing with that same collection of inputs every time.

Some examples of functions: 
- Time worked is related to money earned. 
- The speed of a car is related to the gas it consumes per miles driven.

What kind of relationships are functions, exactly?

# Functions Are Reliable

* Open the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IW5uMg491e33Av_XdGSivsAy28S9QSVivEYonpjTeF8/edit?usp=sharing, Interactive Function Activity}.
* Choose an x-value that is within the domain of the graph. Apply the rule to your x-value to get a y-value. Finally, place a dot on the graph with the appropriate (x,y) coordinates.
* When all of our dots appear, we'll end up with a visual representation of the function!

# Functions Are Reliable

How can we make a graph of a function from its rule?

Are there curves or lines that a function could not make? Why or why not?

# Identifying Functions from Graphs

We can test a graph to see whether or not it's a function using the "vertical line test". {style="font-size:14pt"}

@image{images/two-graphs-for-vertical-line-test.png}{width="800"}

<!--
Imagine overlaying a series of vertical lines on the graph. If the graph represents a function, none of the vertical lines will cross the graph at more than one point. If there is any vertical line that can be drawn that would intersect more than one point on the graph, it means the same input can have more than one output and the relationship is not a function.

# Identifying Functions from Graphs

Turn to @printable-exercise{functions-graphs.adoc} and use a straightedge and a pencil to draw vertical lines on each of the graphs to help you determine whether or not they are functions. 

When you finish, go on to @printable-exercise{functions-graphs-2.adoc}.

<!--
As students work, circulate around the room and make sure that they are actually drawing vertical lines on the graphs. Some students may benefit from circling the point where each vertical line intersects the graph.

What did you Notice? 

What did you Wonder? 

Record your responses on @printable-exercise{notice-wonder-functions.adoc}.

<!--
1. Noticings might include: functions can be lines, curves, v-shaped, or scatterplots! 
1. Wonderings might include: Why might some scatterplots represent functions and others not? Are there other forms functions can take? How do you end up with a circle on a graph?

# Identifying Functions from Tables

Turn to @printable-exercise{how-tables-fail-vertical-line-test.adoc} and follow the directions.

How can we identify whether or not a table of values represents a function? 

<!--
Circulate around the room verifying that students are remembering how to use the vertical line test and correctly identifying which tables represent functions.

# Identifying Functions from Tables

Turn to @printable-exercise{functions-tables.adoc} and look at the values in each table carefully to determine whether or not the table represents a function. If it's not a function, circle or highlight the points that let you know it can't be a function. 

When you're done, turn to @printable-exercise{notice-wonder-functions.adoc} and add any new Notices or Wonderings you may have. Then turn to @printable-exercise{functions-tables-graphs.adoc}.

<!--
As students work, circulate around the room and make sure that they are actually circling or highlighting the points on the tables that tell them that the table doesn't represent a function.

# Identifying Functions from Tables

What did you Notice? 

What did you Wonder? 

<!--
Confirm that students have correctly identified which graphs represent functions, and then lead a discussion on the activities above.

1. Students might notice: It can still be a function if y-values repeats. It didn't matter whether or not the x-values followed a pattern. It was easier for me to read the tables when the x-values were in order. 
1.Students might wonder: Why weren't the x-values always in order? If the points were on a graph, would they be connected? Can there ever be decimal values for x and y? What would these tables look like on a graph?
