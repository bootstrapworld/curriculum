Use @starter-file{plagiarism} to respond to the questions, below.

== Part 1: chimpanzee-article

Let's compare the output of `distance-to(chimpanzee-article)` with the output of `distance-to-cleaned(chimpanzee-article)`.

@n On both output tables, the angle produced in the "chimpanzee" row is zero. Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The `chimpanzee-article` is identical to itself, }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{both with and without stopwords.}}

@n When we used `distance-to-cleaned`, the angles were generally larger. Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The articles are _more different_ }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{after the stopwords are removed. When we remove stopwords, we end up comparing more meaningful sets of words.}}

@n When we used `distance-to-cleaned`, four articles produced an angle measure of 90°. What does this tell us?
@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{Articles separated by 90° are as different as possible. In other words, when we remove words like the, as, and of, there are no commonalities between the documents.}
}


== Part 2: mystery-article

Follow the steps below to make some discoveries about the `mystery-article`.

@n Type `distance-to(mystery-article)` in the Interactions Area. Look at the different angle measurements produced. Do you notice any outliers? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Yes}} Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{All of the angle differences are between 58° and 72°, }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{except for `giraffe-article`, which has an angle difference of ~48.738°.}}

@n Think back to when you compared `student-essay` with `elephant-article`. Those two paragraphs were virtually identical, which resulted in an angle difference of about 23.706°. The difference between these two rays (`giraffe-article` and `mystery-article`) is much greater, but still seems unusual. Can you make any hypotheses about `mystery-article`?

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{Maybe the mystery article is about an animal that is similar or related to the giraffe, meaning that some of the same words would be used to describe it.}
}

@n Let’s investigate further. Type `distance-to-cleaned(mystery-essay)`. What do you notice? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{All of the angle differences}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{increased to 88° or greater, except for `giraffe-article`, which now has an angle difference of 76°.}}


@n Time for the reveal! Type `mystery-article` into the Interactions Area. Why was the angle difference between this article and `giraffe-article` small? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The mystery article is about okapis, which are closely related to giraffes. Several unique words appear in both articles,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{including "okapi", "giraffe", "ossicone", etc.}}

== Part 3: Revisiting student-essay

@n  Type `distance-to-cleaned(student-essay)` in the Interactions Area. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{*Notice*: With the stop words removed, there is no angle difference between the ray representing `student-essay` and the ray representing `elephant-essay`. This student would have an extremely difficult time convincing their teacher that they did not plagiarize. *Wonder*: When a plagiarism detector produces an output of zero, is there any way that the student is innocent?}
