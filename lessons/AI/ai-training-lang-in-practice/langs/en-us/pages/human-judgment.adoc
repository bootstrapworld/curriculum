= The Importance of Human Judgment

== How Many Dimensions?

@vspace{1ex}

A teacher asks students to write an essay on one of three topics: modern art, soccer, or zebras. The teacher feeds the essays to a plagiarism detector *to compare the essays to one another.* It plots 32 points in a 1023-dimensional space.

@n What does the number 32 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher has provided the plagiarism detector with 32 student essays.}}

@n What does the number 1023 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{In sum, the essays include 1023 different words.}}

@n After thinking on it, the teacher realizes that students don't merely copy one another's writing; instead, they copy/paste text from the internet! The teacher opens her plagiarism detection software and tells it to consume a large @vocab{training corpus} of internet text about modern art, soccer, and zebras. How many dimensions will the space contain, now?

@vspace{1ex}

*Circle one:* @hspace{1em} more dimensions @hspace{5em}  the same amount of dimensions @hspace{5em} fewer dimensions

@n Explain your choice.

@blanklines{4}{
@ifsoln{The space will contain more dimensions. For a bag-of-words model, dimensionality reflects how many different words are in the corpus. We can assume that a large corpus of internet text will use more words than the students in the teacher's class did.}

== Assessing the Output

@vspace{1ex}

Consider each of the four outputs, below. What do you think is happening in each of scenarios? How would you advise the teacher?

@n The 32 points are scattered seemingly randomly all over a 1023-dimensional space, with no apparent clustering.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The models for the documents are not close; students appear to have written essays with a range of different words that appear in}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{varying frequencies. The teacher should have no need to worry.}}

@n The 32 points are scattered seemingly randomly, but there are two points plotted extremely close together.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{With the exception of two essays, students appear to have written essays with a range of different words that appear in varying frequencies. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher should focus on those two essays. Observe that the similarity is of the models, but the documents themselves may be quite different.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Therefore, the teacher should carefully examine the corresponding documents. If the documents are not similar, the closeness of the points}}

@n There appear to be three large, loose clusters of randomly plotted points.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{One likely explanation is that the three large, loose clusters represent the three different topics: modern art, zebras, and soccer. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students who write about one topic are likely to use similar terminology, and that terminology will differ by topic.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Since our three topics are extremely different, we should expect little overlap in specialized terminology between them}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{(although the “English”) parts will likely be quite similar). The teacher should have no need to worry.}}

@n There appear to be two large, loose clusters of randomly plotted points, with one point positioned far away from the two clusters. +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Perhaps one of the topics was far less popular than the others, and only one student opted to write about that topic.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher should have no need to worry.}}
