= What Makes a Language?

Respond to the prompts below by interacting with @starter-file{soekia}.

== Soekia & Tic-Tac-Toe 

Access the _Documents_ panel by clicking the "LOOK INSIDE @image{../images/arrow-forward-icon.png, 15}" button in the upper right-hand corner of @starter-file{soekia, "Soekia"}. 

- Click @image{../images/collection-icon.png,15} and select @image{../images/grid-icon.png, 15} from the drop-down menu.

@n Describe what you see. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are twenty-six documents. Document 1 is the same tic-tac-toe game we already played.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each document is a different color. It looks like they probably all narrate different possible tic-tac-toe games.}}

@n How are the documents of the tic-tac-toe collection *similar* to the documents of the fairy tale collection? How are they *different*? 

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{Both types of documents contain letters from the alphabet. The fairy tale documents contain sentences and paragraphs of words in English. The Tic Tac Toe documents use a special notation (made up of letters and numbers) to represent the moves of the tic-tac-toe game. Both document types can interpreted as a series of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.}

In the _Generate Text_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/send-icon.png, 15} to tell Soekia to generate a set of game moves. 
- Click ▶️ *TicTacToe-player* (beneath the list of moves) to see a visualization of the game you just generated. _Note that the player only appears after you have generated and paused a tic-tac-toe game._

@n In what ways does the game seem *similar* to a normal game of Tic Tac Toe? In what ways does it seem *different*?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{*Similarities:* Xs and Os alternate, gradually filling up the board. *Differences:* The game keeps adding Xs and Os after the grid is already filled up until all 45 moves from the list have been used up!

== Thinking About Natural Language Processing 

In the _Documents_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/collection-icon.png,15} and select @image{../images/music-icon.png,15} from the dropdown menu. 

In the _Generate Text_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/send-icon.png, 15} to tell Soekia to write you some music. Click ▶️ *Music-Player* to try playing your composition.
 
@n What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n @right{@image{../images/repeat-sign.png, 75}}In musical notation, a "repeat sign" (pictured on right) indicates that a section of the music should be repeated. Does Soekia's music player repeat when it arrives at a repeat sign? Why or why not? (_Stuck? Test it out in Soekia._)

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No, Soekia does not repeat sections of the music. Soekia does not know anything about making music!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It is simply adhering to the rules of probability to generate songs. It rarely correctly produces a repeat sign.}}

In the _Documents_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/collection-icon.png,15} and select @image{../images/chess-icon.png,15} from the bottom of the dropdown menu.

@n In actual chess, a player starts with two knights and there is no way to gain additional knights. How come additional knights sometimes appear in this chess game?

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{If Soekia's algorithm dictates that a knight needs to be moved, Soekia finds a way to move a knight!}
