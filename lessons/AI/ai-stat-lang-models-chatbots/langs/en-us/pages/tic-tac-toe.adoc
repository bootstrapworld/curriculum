| _In case you need a refresher on the game:_ 

- The tic-tac-toe board is a 3x3 grid.
- One person will draw an *X* in one of the squares.
- The other person will draw and *O* in one of the squares.
- Keep taking turns -- the goal is to get three in a row or block your neighbor from getting three in a row.
- The game ends when one of you gets three in a row or the grid is full.

== Design a Tic Tac Toe Notation


In order to communicate with Soekia about tic tac toe games, we'll need to record the moves using an annotation.

- Let's think of the 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid as a first quadrant coordinate plane with the origin (0,0) in the bottom left corner
- For each move, our notation must indicate: 
  * the player whose turn it is (X or O)
  * the ordered pair (x, y) for the location of the player's move on that turn 

@n How would you annotate the first turn (above)? @fitb{10em}{} @hspace{5em} The second turn? @fitb{10em}{}

== Annotating a Game of Tic Tac Toe

@n Complete the table by translating the 5 turn sequence above into our tic tac toe annotation.
@indented{_For Reference:_ 

- _If player X makes a move in the bottom right corner, we would describe that turn as: {nbsp} X31_
- _If player O makes a move in the middle of the left column, we would describe that turn as: {nbsp} O12_
