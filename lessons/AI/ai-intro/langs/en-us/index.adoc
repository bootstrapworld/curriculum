== What is Artificial Intelligence?

@objective{ai-effect}
@objective{ai-vs-ml}

=== Overview

Students discover the challenges of defining AI.

=== Launch

You've probably heard some buzz about @vocab{Artificial Intelligence}, or AI. The goal of AI is to enable a computer to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is what makes ChatGPT (and many other things!) work. ChatGPT already appears to be able to develop video games, achieve high scores on the SAT, write novels... and its capabilities are growing every day!

But what *counts* as AI?

@teacher{
Make sure you've made a copy of the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1w3oOSXTuMzCLLRDl7zh4YH_ddry2vUIGSSYOpqPWh-U/copy, survey} and have created a link to share with students, so that you can look at your data as a class!

@lesson-instruction{
- The survey link I've shared with you will give you a chance to consider seven different technologies and whether or not you think they represent AI.
- No need to overthink. If you're not sure, you can choose "I have no idea!" and move on to the next question.
}

@teacher{
This survey is designed to get students thinking about what constitutes AI. Once students have completed the survey, debrief using the questions and text below. The goal is to help students recognize that the best answer, in this case, is almost always "I have no idea!", because as different technological innovations become more familiar and more accessible... we stop thinking about them as AI.
}

@slidebreak


@QandA{
@Q{Did you find it easy or difficult to decide if each technology was AI or not?}
@A{Students will likely find this survey difficult to complete. That's a good thing! We want to illustrate that pinning down what is or isn't AI is challenging.}

@Q{How did you decide whether to vote "yes", "no", or "I have no idea?"}
@A{Responses will vary, but students will likely explain that they questioned whether human intelligence was needed to complete each task. Highlight the inherent messiness of this approach.}
}

@slidebreak


As you might imagine, the conversation around AI is often philosophical. AI uses a wide range of methods and technologies to mimic human intelligence. To understand what sort of tasks require human intelligence, we must consider _what it means to be human_, a topic which is informed by worldview and personal beliefs.

Pinning down exactly *what* AI is can be difficult! Because as different technological innovations become more familiar and more accessible... we stop thinking about them as AI.

@slidebreak


Computer scientist John McCarthy developed the term "the AI effect" to describe this phenomenon. According to McCarthy, humans often adjust either the definition of AI or the concept of intelligence to *exclude* capabilities that AI systems have mastered. In his words, "As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore."

@slidebreak


@QandA{

@Q{Have you witnessed "the AI effect"? If so, what were the circumstances?}

@A{The idea of a self-driving car no longer seems radical and futuristic as it did 5 years ago.}
@A{Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa have become commonplace.}
@A{When Deep Blue beat reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996, it was amazing. But the  chess-playing expert system run on a unique purpose-built IBM supercomputer couldn't do anything else besides play chess!}


@Q{If you haven't witnessed the AI effect, have you experienced a different--but similar--phenomenon, where technology that once AMAZED you suddenly seems... not terribly impressive? If so, what were the circumstances?}

@A{Responses will vary; invite students to share.}
@A{Teachers might share their experiences about life before robot vacuums, the internet, cell phones or video calls.}

=== Investigate

Modern AI is largely driven by a set of techniques called @vocab{Machine Learning} (ML for short). In Machine Learning, the computer analyzes lots of @vocab{data}, and then uses statistical models to identify patterns in that data. (Throughout this curriculum, you will encounter many different examples that illustrate the diversity of data on which Machine Learning can be applied.) While AI is often spoken about mystically, Machine Learning is concrete: it is a collection of @vocab{data-driven algorithms}--the instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task, which produce better results when given more data.

@slidebreak


AI so deeply relies on Machine Learning that many computer scientists prefer to use the phrase "AI/ML" when discussing a certain sort of technology that increasingly pervades our world.

An example of Machine Learning would be the particular algorithm that determines the angle of the steering wheel on a self-driving car.

When that algorithm is combined with others that detect people, read signs, and assess road conditions, we have an example of what people might consider AI... but it is really still just a collection of algorithms!

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{How would you describe the relationship between AI and Machine Learning?}
@A{Conversations about AI often enter philosophical territory.}
@A{Conversations about Machine Learning focus on algorithms used to identify patterns and make decisions.}
@A{ML powers modern AI.}

@Q{What is the AI effect?}
@A{The AI effect is when humans describe the behavior of an AI program as not truly intelligent.}
}


== Thinking about AI in Pop Culture

=== Overview

Students consider messages from various media about AI.

=== Launch

Many characterizations of AI envision technology that *does not currently exist*. The futuristic (often dystopian) AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the technology of the present.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
}

=== Investigate

Let's consider what sort of AI information we've absorbed just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games, along with our own personal opinions.

@lesson-instruction{
- Use @printable-exercise{ai-in-pop-culture.adoc} to guide your conversation and record your thoughts.
- With a partner, choose one book / movie / TV show / video game.
- Then identify *one* of the messages about AI from the list below that the book / movie / TV show / video game you picked supports.

** AI must be safely controlled at all times.
** AI could lead to social isolation.
** AI can help us understand what it means to be human.
** AI can help advance humanity and scientific discovery.
** AI may pose a threat to humanity.
** AI can perpetuate existing societal biases, leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups.
** Humans are helpless in the face of AI.

- Discuss how the media you picked supports the message.
- Share your reflections with the class.

=== Synthesize

@QandA{

@Q{What are some questions that you have about Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Learning that you'd like to learn more about?}

@Q{What _confuses_ you about AI/ML?}
}

@teacher{Consider writing down students' questions and possible misconceptions about AI. You can revisit these questions as answers emerge in subsequent lessons. If there are questions that surface that might inform future Bootstrap lesson development, we'd love for you to share them with us at @link{mailto:contact@bootstrapworld.org, contact@bootstrapworld.org}!}
