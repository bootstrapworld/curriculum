== What is Artificial Intelligence?
@objective{ai-vs-ml}

=== Overview

Students think broadly about artificial intelligence and compare it to machine learning.

=== Launch

You've probably heard some buzz about Artificial Intelligence, or AI. The goal of AI is to enable a computer to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is what makes ChatGPT (and many other things!) work. ChatGPT already appears to be able to develop video games, achieve high scores on the SAT, write novels... and its capabilities are growing every day!

As you might imagine, the conversation around AI is often philosophical. AI uses a wide range of methods and technologies to mimic human intelligence.

To understand what sort of tasks require human intelligence, we must consider _what it means to be human_, a topic which is informed by worldview and personal beliefs.

Modern AI is largely driven by a set of techniques called Machine Learning (ML for short). In ML,
the computer analyzes lots of data, and then uses statistical models to identify patterns in that data. While AI is often spoken about mystically, Machine Learning is concrete: it is a collection of data-driven algorithms that we can study and explore.

AI so deeply relies on Machine Learning that many computer scientists prefer to use the phrase "AI/ML" when discussing a certain sort of technology that increasingly pervades our world.

An example of Machine Learing would be the particular algorithm that determines the angle of the steering wheel on a self-driving car.

When that algorithm is combined with others that detect people, read signs, and assess road conditions, we have an example of what people might consider AI... but it is really still just a collection of algorithms.

=== Investigate

Many characterizations of AI envision technology that *does not currently exist*. The futuristic (often dystopian) AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the technology of the present.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
}


Let's consider what sort of AI information we've absorbed just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games, along with our own personal opinions.


@lesson-instruction{
- With a partner, choose one book / movie / TV show / video game.
- Then identify *one* of the messages about AI from the list below that the book / movie / TV show / video game you picked supports.

** AI must be safely controlled at all times.
** AI could lead to social isolation.
** AI can help us understand what it means to be human.
** AI can help advance humanity and scientific discovery.
** AI may pose a threat to humanity.
** AI can perpetuate existing societal biases, leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups.
** Humans are helpless in the face of AI.

- Discuss how the media you picked supports the message.
- Share your reflections with the class.
}


=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{How are AI and ML alike? How are they different?}

@A{AI is a broad concept, while ML is a specific set of algorithms that power modern AI. Conversations about AI often enter philosophical territory, whereas conversations about ML focus on algorithms used to identify patterns and make decisions.}

@Q{What are some questions that you have about AI/ML? What are you hoping to learn?}

@Q{What _confuses_ you about AI/ML?}
}

@teacher{Consider writing down students' questions and possible misconceptions about AI. You can revisit these questions as  answers emerge in subsequent lessons.}
