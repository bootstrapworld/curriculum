== What is Artificial Intelligence?

@objective{ai-effect}
@objective{ai-vs-ml}

=== Overview

Students discover the challenges of defining AI.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

You've probably heard some buzz about @vocab{Artificial Intelligence}, or AI. The goal of AI is to enable a computer to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is what makes ChatGPT (and many other things!) work. ChatGPT already appears to be able to develop video games, achieve high scores on the SAT, write novels... and its capabilities are growing every day!

But what *counts* as AI?

@teacher{
Make sure you've made a copy of the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1w3oOSXTuMzCLLRDl7zh4YH_ddry2vUIGSSYOpqPWh-U/copy, survey} and have created a link to share with students, so that you can look at your data as a class!
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

@lesson-instruction{
- The survey link I've shared with you will give you a chance to consider seven different technologies and whether or not you think they represent AI.
- No need to overthink. If you're not sure, you can choose "I have no idea!" and move on to the next question.
}

@teacher{
This survey is designed to get students thinking about what constitutes AI. Once students have completed the survey, debrief using the questions and text below. The goal is to help students recognize that the best answer, in this case, is almost always "I have no idea!", because as different technological innovations become more familiar and more accessible... we stop thinking about them as AI.
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

@QandA{
@Q{Did you find it easy or difficult to decide if each technology was AI or not?}
@A{Students will likely find this survey difficult to complete. That's a good thing! We want to illustrate that pinning down what is or isn't AI is challenging.}

@Q{How did you decide whether to vote "yes", "no", or "I have no idea?"}
@A{Responses will vary}
@A{If students asked themselves whether human intelligence was needed to complete each task, highlight the inherent messiness of this approach.}
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

AI uses a wide range of methods and technologies to mimic human intelligence. To understand what sort of tasks require human intelligence, we must consider _what it means to be human_, a topic which is deeply philosophical - informed by worldview and personal beliefs.

Also, as different technological innovations become more familiar and more accessible... we stop thinking about them as AI.

@slidebreak{Launch}

Computer scientist John McCarthy developed the term @vocab{AI effect} to describe this phenomenon. 

According to McCarthy, humans often adjust either the definition of AI or the concept of intelligence to *exclude* capabilities that AI systems have mastered. In his words, "As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore."

@slidebreak{Launch}

@QandA{

@Q{Have you witnessed "the AI effect"? If so, what were the circumstances?}
@A{Responses will vary; invite students to share.}
@A{Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa have become commonplace.}
@A{The idea of a self-driving car no longer seems as radical and futuristic as it did 5 years ago.}
@A{When Deep Blue beat reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996, it was amazing. But the  chess-playing expert system run on a unique purpose-built IBM supercomputer couldn't do anything else besides play chess!}


@Q{Have you experienced a different--but similar--phenomenon, where technology that once AMAZED you suddenly seems... not terribly impressive? If so, what were the circumstances?}
@A{Responses will vary; invite students to share.}
@A{Teachers might share their experiences about life before robot vacuums, the internet, cell phones or video calls.}
}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

Modern AI is largely driven by a set of techniques called @vocab{Machine Learning} (ML for short). AI so deeply relies on Machine Learning that many computer scientists prefer to use the phrase "AI/ML" when discussing a certain sort of technology that increasingly pervades our world.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

In Machine Learning, the computer analyzes lots of @vocab{data}, and then uses statistical models to identify patterns in that data. (Throughout this curriculum, you will encounter many different examples that illustrate the diversity of data on which Machine Learning can be applied.) While AI is often spoken about mystically, Machine Learning is concrete: it is a collection of @vocab{data-driven algorithms}--the instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task, which produce better results when given more data.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

An example of Machine Learning would be the particular set of algorithms that determines the angle of the steering wheel on a self-driving car.  When those algorithms are combined with others that detect people, read signs, and assess road conditions, we have an example of what people might consider AI... but it is really still just a collection of algorithms!

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

@QandA{
@Q{How would you describe the relationship between AI and Machine Learning?}
@A{AI combines multiple Machine Learning algorithms.}
@A{Conversations about AI often enter philosophical territory.}
@A{Conversations about Machine Learning focus on algorithms used to identify patterns and make decisions.}
@A{ML powers modern AI.}

@Q{What is the AI effect?}
@A{The way the bar for what behavior we consider intelligent for a machine shifts as we become used to machines being able to do things that used to seem impossible.}

== Quantifying Similarity

=== Overview

Students consider what it means to quantify similarity.

=== Launch

You just spent some time thinking about seven unique ML technologies: 

- spell check
- plagiarism detection
- self-driving cars
- chess-playing technology
- song/video recommendation technology
- google maps
- google translate

And learned that these technologies rely on machine learning - or, more specifically, @vocab{data-driven algorithms}... but what else do they have in common? 

@teacher{If your students want to speculate about what commonalities the technologies share, invite them to do so!}

=== Investigate

Many machine learning technologies use some method for quantifying similarity.

To wrap our heads around what that means, we're going to look at some mountain landscapes! 

@lesson-instruction{
Refer to the mountains landscapes pictured below as you complete the *first section* of @printable-exercise{quantifying-similarity.adoc}

}

@QandA{
@Q{What similarities do the 9 photos have?}
@A{Responses will vary.}
@A{They all show mountains and sky.}
@A{The photos are all rectangular in shape, and the rectangles are all the same size.}
@A{The photos all make me want to visit the mountains.}

@Q{What differences do the 9 photos have?}
@A{Some photos show a body of water, others do not.} @A{Some photos include the sun, others do not.}
@A{Some photos show mountains with snow, others show mountains with grass.} 
@A{The color palettes differ from photo to photo (blues, greens, whites).}
@A{Some mountains appear round while others appear pointy.}
@A{In some photos, the mountains occupy most of the photograph, while in others, the mountains are just a small fraction of what is represented.}
}


@lesson-instruction{
Complete the *second section* of @printable-exercise{quantifying-similarity.adoc}.
}

@QandA{
@Q{How was the experience of identifying similar and different photos? Was it simple or challenging?}
@A{Student responses will vary. Some students may articulate that it was challenging to decide which similarities to prioritize, when they were able to identify similarities across all photos.}

@Q{How confident are you in the decisions you made on the second section of the @printable-exercise{quantifying-similarity.adoc}?} 
@A{Student responses will vary.}
}


Let's think about another way of quantifying similarity. 

@center{@image{images/mountains-v-water.png, 400}}

@QandA{

@Q{What do you Notice about the coordinate plane image?}
@A{Only the first quadrant is visible.}
@A{The x-axis is "size of body of water".}
@A{The y-axis is "size of mountains".}
@A{There are three mountain landscapes (numbers 1, 5, and 7) positioned at various points on the coordinate plane.}

@Q{What do you Wonder about it?}
@A{How were the labels on the axes determined?}
@A{Where would I put the other landscapes on this coordinate plane?}
@A{How can I position landscapes that do not have any body of water in them?}

@Q{Where do you think Photo 2 belongs on this coordinate plane?}
@A{Invite a student to the board to identify where Photo 2 goes.}
@A{It should have a similar y-coordinate and a slightly greater x-coordinate.}
}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the third section of @printable-exercise{quantifying-similarity.adoc}.
}

NEED TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION OF WHAT THEY JUST DID / LEARNED / WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{How were the two ways you quantified similarity alike? How were they different?}
@Q{Can you think of any other ways to quantify the similarity of the nine mountain photos?}
}


== Thinking about AI in Pop Culture

=== Overview

Students consider messages from various media about AI.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

Many characterizations of AI envision technology that *does not currently exist*. The futuristic (often dystopian) AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the technology of the present.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

Let's consider what sort of AI information we've absorbed just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games, along with our own personal opinions.

@lesson-instruction{
- With a partner, choose one book / movie / TV show / video game.
- Then identify *one* of the messages about AI from the list below that the book / movie / TV show / video game you picked supports.

** AI must be safely controlled at all times.
** AI could lead to social isolation.
** AI can help us understand what it means to be human.
** AI can help advance humanity and scientific discovery.
** AI may pose a threat to humanity.
** AI can perpetuate existing societal biases, leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups.
** Humans are helpless in the face of AI.

- Discuss how the media you picked supports the message.
- Record your thinking on @printable-exercise{ai-in-pop-culture.adoc}.
- Share your reflections with the class.

@QandA{

@Q{What are some questions that you have about Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Learning that you'd like to learn more about?}

@Q{What _confuses_ you about AI/ML?}
}

@teacher{Consider writing down students' questions and possible misconceptions about AI. You can revisit these questions as answers emerge in subsequent lessons.
