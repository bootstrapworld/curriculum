= Measuring Similarity

== Previewing the Photos

@n What about the nine photos makes them all _similar_ to one another?

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{Possible responses: They all show mountains and sky. The photos are all rectangular in shape, and the rectangles are all the same size. The photos all make me want to visit the mountains.	
}
}

@n What about the nine photos makes them all _different_ from one another?

@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{Possible responses: Some photos show a body of water, others do not. Some photos include the sun, others do not. Some photos show mountains with snow, others show mountain with grass. The color palettes differ from photo to photo (blues, greens, whites). Some mountains appear round while others appear pointy. In some photos, the mountains occupy most of the photograph, while in others, the mountains are just a small fraction of what is represented.
}
}

== Sorting the Photos

@n "Alt text," short for alternative text, is a short description added to images on a webpage to provide context for users who cannot see the image. Write a description of Photo 1 that could serve as alt text, describing the image for someone who cannot see it.

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{There is a mountain landscape that fills up just a narrow strip of the rectangular photo (maybe 10% of the area). There is a body of water in the foreground and a cloudy sky with a bright sun shining behind the clouds on the left-hand side of the photo.
}	
}

@n Which is _more similar_ to Photo 1: Photo 2 or Photo 3? Explain how you decided which photo is _more similar_.

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{*Photo 2 possible responses:* Like the mountains in Photo 1, the mountains in Photo 2 fill up just a narrow strip of the whole photo. Similar to Photo 1, Photo 2 also includes a body of water in the foreground and a sun in the background. *Photo 3 possible responses:* Photo 3's color palette includes mostly white, brown, and blue.
}
}

@n Write a description of Photo 4 that could serve as alt text, providing as much detail as you can.

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{The green, grassy foreground speckled with some trees occupies about half of the photo's area. The mountains in the background appear jagged and pointy, with no snow. The blue sky in the background has lots of clouds, but no visible sun.
}	
}

@n Which is _more similar_ to Photo 4: Photo 5 or Photo 6? Explain how you decided which photo is _more similar_.

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{*Photo 5 possible response:* The foreground slopes down from the upper left of both photos. *Photo 6 possible responses:* Both photos include a grassy foreground and a sky with clouds. Photo 5 does not include any grass, and the grass takes up a lot of space in Photo 4.

== Using the Coordinate Plane

@n We just thought about where these images would land on a coordinate grid with its axes labeled _"body of water pixels"_ and _"mountain pixels"_. Think of other possible labels for the @math{x} and @math{y} axes. How many can you come up with?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{cloud coverage, mountain pointiness, position of the sun in the sky, amount of greenery, amount of blue, size of foreground, size of background, etc.}
