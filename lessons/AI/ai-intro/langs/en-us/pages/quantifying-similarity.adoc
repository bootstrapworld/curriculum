@n What about the nine photos makes them all _similar_ to one another?

@ifsoln{Possible responses: They all show mountains and sky. The photos are all rectangular in shape, and the rectangles are all the same size. The photos all make me want to visit the mountains.

@ifsoln{Possible responses: Some photos show a body of water, others do not. Some photos include the sun, others do not. Some photos show mountains with snow, others show mountain with grass. The color palettes differ from photo to photo (blues, greens, whites). Some mountains appear round while others appear pointy. In some photos, the mountains occupy most of the photograph, while in others, the mountains are just a small fraction of what is represented.
