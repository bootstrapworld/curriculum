| _In case you need a refresher on the game:_ 

- The tic-tac-toe board is a 3x3 grid.
- One person will draw an *X* in one of the squares.
- The other person will draw and *O* in one of the squares.
- Keep taking turns -- the goal is to get three in a row or block your neighbor from getting three in a row.
- The game ends when one of you gets three in a row or the grid is full.
