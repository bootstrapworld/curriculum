== Assessing Correlations

Use `lr-plot` to build several scatter plots to describe the relationship between the cost of insurance (`premium`) and each of the other variables in the dataset. Fill in the blanks below to describe the relationship between premium and driver's age.

@n Insurance premium vs. driver's age: There is a @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{strong}}{weak /strong / moderate}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{negative}}{positive / negative} correlation where r = @fitb{4ex}{@ifsoln{0.78}}.

@n Insurance premium vs. driver's experience: There is a @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{strong}}{weak /strong / moderate}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{negative}}{positive / negative} correlation where r = @fitb{4ex}{@ifsoln{0.80}}.

@n Insurance premium vs. number of accidents: There is a @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{moderate}}{weak /strong / moderate}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{positive}}{positive / negative} correlation where r = @fitb{4ex}{@ifsoln{0.411}}.

@n Insurance premium vs. annual mileage: There is a @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{weak}}{weak / strong / moderate}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{positive}}{positive / negative} correlation where r = @fitb{4ex}{@ifsoln{0.022}}.

@n Insurance premium vs. car's age: There is a @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{weak}}{weak / strong / moderate}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{negative}}{positive / negative} correlation where r = @fitb{4ex}{@ifsoln{0.172}}.

== Driver's Age vs. Insurance Premium

Here is the regression equation for driver's age versus insurance premium: @math{y = -0.3335x + 507.608}. Use it to respond to the prompts, below.

@n According to the model, a driver who is 18 pays $@fitb{10ex}{} insurance premium.

@n According to the model, a driver who is 30 pays $@fitb{10ex}{} insurance premium.

@n According to the model, a driver who is 60 pays $@fitb{10ex}{} insurance premium.

@n Ben is 60 and has been driving since he was a teenager. Paul is 60 and just took his driving test last week. Who do you think is at greater risk of getting into a car accident? @fitb{}{}

@n Given what you just learned about Ben and Paul, do you see any problems  with using the regression equation (above) to determine insurance premiums? Explain. @fitb{}{} +
