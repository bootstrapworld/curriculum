= Building and Testing a Decision Tree

@link-instructions{For this page you will need to refer to your decisions from @printable-exercise{part-2.adoc}.} 

== Build and Understand the Tree

Complete the tree (left), then fill in the blanks (right).

[cols="1,1", stripes="none"]

@ifnotsoln{@center{@image{../images/tree-w-blanks.png, 350}}}
@ifsoln{@center{@image{../images/final-tree.png, 350}}}

@n The root node of this tree is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{age}}.

@vspace{1ex}

@n The first set of branches includes: +
@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{teens}}, @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{twenties}}, and @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{thirties}}.

@n Write the rules that this decision tree follows. Predict that: + 
{nbsp}@fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{interested}}{interested / uninterested} teens will buy the game. +
{nbsp}@fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{everyone}}{who?} in their 20s will buy the game. +
{nbsp}@fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{previous customers}}{who?} in their 30s will buy the game.

== Test the Tree

@n Below is a new set of potential customers. Use the decision tree and rules above to predict whether or not they will buy the game.

@vspace{1ex}

[cols="2,2,3,2,2,2", stripes="none", options="header"]
|===
| name 		| age 		| shopping history 	| interest in game 	| buys game | model predicts
| Kat 		| teen 		| new customer		| yes 				| yes		| @ifsoln{will buy}
| Billy		| twenties	| new customer		| no 				| no		| @ifsoln{will buy}
| Chen	    | twenties 	| previous customer | no  				| no		| @ifsoln{will buy}
|===

@n Compare the "buys game" column with the predictions. For which customers was the computer correct?  @hspace{1em} @ifsoln-choice{Kat} @hspace{1em} Billy @hspace{1em} Chen

@n Should we change any of our rules based on the addition of this new data? Why? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We shouldn't predict that all individuals in their 20s will buy the game. The new test data contradicts the rule.}}

== Reflect

@n Our rules made 100% accurate predictions with our training dataset, but were only 33% accurate with our test dataset. Why?
@blanklines{2}{@ifsoln{The training dataset is small, and only represents a sample of the population. The sample was not representative, as there are individuals in their twenties who choose not to purchase, among others who contradict the training data.}}

@n What could we do to improve the quality of this decision tree? @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{4}{@ifsoln{We would need to collect a bigger, more representative dataset, and then build the tree again.}}
