@n What do you Notice about the two decision trees above?

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{The trees are different because the "not flat" branch of the tree on the right terminates with "mug or cup".}
}

@n What do you Wonder about the two decision trees?

@n Which decision tree (above) would make predictions more efficiently? Explain. +
_Hint: A program is *efficient* when it performs a task with minimal time, memory, energy or data._
