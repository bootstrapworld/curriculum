@n What do you Notice about the two decision trees above?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The trees are different because the "not flat" branch of the tree on the right terminates with "mug or cup".}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you Wonder about the two decision trees?

@n Which decision tree (above) is more efficient? Explain. +
_Hint: AI is *efficient* when the computer performs a task with minimal time, memory, energy or data._

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The decision tree on the right. There are fewer decisions to make!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n How could efficiency be advantageous? Why might it be disadvantageous to maximize an AI's efficiency?
