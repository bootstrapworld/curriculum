== Another possible decision tree from this data

@n Make a second decision tree for the same 6 items listed above using "flat?"" as the root node with "used-to-chop" as the first decision node for *yes* and "utensil?"" as the first decision node for *no*

- For each question, add the missing "yes" or "no" arrow.
- Determine whether your arrow will lead to
  * a leaf node (a single item from the list)
  * a decision node (a new question)
- Keep adding to the decision tree until you've created pathways that lead to all 6 categories: Spoon, Fork, Knife, Plate, Mug, Cup
