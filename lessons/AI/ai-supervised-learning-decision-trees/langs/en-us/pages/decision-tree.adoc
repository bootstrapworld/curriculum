= Decision Tree: Spoon, Fork, Knife, Plate, Mug, Cup

@n The decision tree below has been started for you, but only the first question "utensil?" has both a yes and a no arrow.

- For each of the other questions, add the missing "yes" or "no" arrow.
- Determine whether your arrow will lead to
  * a leaf node (a single item from the list)
  * a decision node (a new question)
- Keep adding to the decision tree until you've created pathways that lead to all 6 items: Spoon, Fork, Knife, Plate, Mug, Cup
