- previous teenage customers @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{will not buy}}{will buy / will not buy / no prediction}
- new teenage customers @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{will buy}}{will buy / will not buy / no prediction}

| Predict that 

- interested teenage shoppers @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{will buy}}{will buy / will not buy / no prediction}
- uninterested teenage shoppers @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{will not buy}}{will buy / will not buy / no prediction}

Place a checkmark below each value that the computer would predict correctly. 

@n Use the decision stumps to determine how well each rule predicts whether or not teens would buy the game.

| Predict that 											

- new customers in their 30s @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{will buy}}{will buy / will not buy / no prediction}
- previous customers in their 30s @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{will not buy}}{will buy / will not buy / no prediction}

- uninterested customers in their 30s @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{no prediction}}{will buy / will not buy / no prediction}

@n Add checkmarks to the correct predictions. Then determine how well each rule predicts which customers in their thirties buy the game.
