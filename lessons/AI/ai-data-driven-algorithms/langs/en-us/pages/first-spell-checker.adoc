= The First Spell Checker

The very first spell checker would use misspelled words as inputs.

- *First*, it would develop alternative candidates for the misspelled word (input) by making one of the following adjustments: (1) replace a single letter with a different one, or (2) swap the positions of two adjacent letters.

- *Next*, it would search the provided dictionary to see which alternatives were valid options.

- *Finally*, it would produce a list of valid correctly spelled words for the user to choose from.

== Part 1: Follow the Algorithm ("wello")

@n Generate alternative candidates for the misspelled word ("wello") by completing two steps.

- First, replace *one* letter with a different one. We’ve provided a first option to get you started. (Hint: these candidates don’t need to be real words!)

@hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{cello} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{}

- Next, swap the positions of two *adjacent* letters. Again, we've provided a first option to get you started.

@hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{ewllo} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em}

@n Are any of the candidates you listed above _actual_ words? If so, circle them. How many _plausible_ candidates did you find? @fitb{8em}{}

@n In question 1 above, there were only five blanks for you to fill in. About how many more *additional* candidates could you generate by replacing one letter? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A computer would generate 125 options. After replacing the first letter in the word with each of the letters in the alphabet, }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{it would return the first letter to "w" and try replacing each of the other letters in the word with all of the other letters in the alphabet.}}

@fitb{}{}



== Part 2: Reflect

@n What do you think are some limitations of this algorithm? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There is an extremely limited number of ways in which a word can be misspelled.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{For example, if two separate letters in a word are incorrect, the spell checker has no chance of proposing the correct word!}}

@n How is the first spell checker's algorithm similar to whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We can't}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{think of any similarities! Maybe your students will have ideas, though.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n How is the first spell checker's algorithm different from whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Human spell checking relies a lot on context, instinct, and previously acquired knowledge of spelling. The first spell checker }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{did not use any of these tools that humans use. The spell checker has the ability to enumerate thousands of words;}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{no human would even think to approach a spelling error in this way. A human wouldn't have the time or ability to list so many words.}}
