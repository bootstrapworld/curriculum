= The First Spell Checker

The very first spell checker would use misspelled words as inputs.

- *First*, it would develop alternative candidates for the misspelled word (input) by making one of the following adjustments: (1) replace a single letter with a different one, or (2) swap the positions of two adjacent letters.

- *Next*, it would search the provided dictionary to see which alternatives were valid options.

- *Finally*, it would produce a list of valid correctly spelled words for the user to choose from.

== Part 1: Follow the Algorithm ("wello")

@n Generate alternative candidates for the misspelled word ("wello") by completing two steps.

- First, replace *one* letter with a different one. We’ve provided a first option to get you started. (Hint: these candidates don’t need to be real words!)

@hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{cello} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{}

- Next, swap the positions of two *adjacent* letters. Again, we've provided a first option to get you started.

@hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{ewllo} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em}

@n Are any of the candidates you listed above _actual_ words? If so, circle them. How many _plausible_ candidates did you find? @fitb{8em}{}

@n In question 1 above, there were only five blanks for you to fill in. Approximately how many more *additional* candidates do you think you could you generate by replacing one letter? @hspace{1em} about 10 more @hspace{3em} about 50 more @hspace{3em} about 100 more @hspace{3em} about 1000 more

@teacher{A computer would generate 125 options. After replacing the first letter in the word with each of the letters in the alphabet, it would return the first letter to "w" and try replacing each of the other letters in the word with all of the other letters in the alphabet.}


== Part 2: Reflect

@n What do you think are some limitations of this algorithm? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There is an extremely limited number of ways in which a word can be misspelled.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{For example, if two separate letters in a word are incorrect, the spell checker has no chance of proposing the correct word!}}

@n How is the first spell checker's algorithm similar to whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We can't}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{think of any similarities! Maybe your students will have ideas, though.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n How is the first spell checker's algorithm different from whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Human spell checking relies a lot on context, instinct, and previously acquired knowledge of spelling. The first spell checker }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{did not use any of these tools that humans use. The spell checker has the ability to enumerate thousands of words;}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{no human would even think to approach a spelling error in this way. A human wouldn't have the time or ability to list so many words.}}
