@n What is the *first word that is spelled incorrectly*? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{wello}} How did you know that that word was misspelled? Explain in as much detail as you can. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample responses: "wello" is not a word that I have encountered before; I know that from experience that it would make sense to say "hello" }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{before class starts; "wello" and "hello" have four letters the same with just the first letter being different.}}

@n What correctly-spelled word do you think the author _intended_ to write instead? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{hello}}  How did you choose that word in particular? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Although "cello" and "fellow" (among others) are also close misspellings, "hello" makes the most sense. Having a greeting here fits and }}

@n Do you think a 6-year old would be able to identify and correct the second misspelled word in this sentence? Explain. @fitb{}{}
