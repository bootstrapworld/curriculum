= Ode to a Spell Checker by Jerrold H Zar


Eye halve a spelling check her,

It came with my pea sea.

It plane lee marks four my revue

Miss steaks aye kin knot sea.


@vspace{1ex}

Eye ran this poem threw it,

Your sure reel glad two no.

Its vary polished in it’s weigh,

My checker tolled me sew.


@vspace{1ex}

A check her is a bless sing;

It freeze yew lodes of thyme.

It helps me right awl stiles two reed,

And aides me when aye rime.


@vspace{1ex}

Each frays come posed up on my screen,

Eye trussed too bee a joule;

The checker pours o’er every word

To cheque sum spelling rule.


@vspace{1ex}

Bee fore wee rote with checkers

Hour spelling was inn deck line,

Butt now when wee dew have a laps,

Wee are knot maid too wine.


@vspace{1ex}

Butt now bee cause my spelling

Is checked with such grate flare,

There are know faults with in my cite,

Of nun eye am a wear.


@vspace{1ex}

Now spelling does knot phase me,

It does knot bring a tier;

My pay purrs awl due glad den

With wrapped words fare as hear.


@vspace{1ex}

To rite with care is quite a feet

Of witch won should be proud;

And we mussed dew the best wee can

Sew flaws are knot aloud.


@vspace{1ex}

That’s why eye brake in two averse

Cuz eye dew want too please.

Sow glad eye yam that aye did bye

This soft wear four pea seas.
