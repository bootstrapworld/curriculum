= Ode to a Spell Checker by Jerrold H Zar (Revised)


I have a spelling checker,

It came with my PC.

It plainly marks for my review

Mistakes I cannot see.


@vspace{1ex}

I ran this poem through it

You're sure real glad to know.

It's very polished in its way,

My checker told me so.


@vspace{1ex}

A checker is a blessing,

It frees you loads of time.

It helps me write all styles to read,

And aides me when I rhyme.


@vspace{1ex}

Each phrase composed upong my screen,

I trust to be a jewel;

The checker pores over every word

To check some spelling rule.


@vspace{1ex}

Before we wrote with checkers

Our spelling was in decline.

But now when we do have a lapse

We are not made to whine.


@vspace{1ex}

But now because my spelling

Is checked with such great flair,

There are no faults within my site,

Of none I am aware.


@vspace{1ex}

Now spelling does not phase me,

It does not bring a tear;

My papers all do gladden

with rapt words fair as here.


@vspace{1ex}

To write with care is quite a feat

Of which one should be proud;

And we must do the best we can

So flaws are not allowed.


@vspace{1ex}

Thatâ€™s why I break into a verse

Cause I do want to please.

So glad I yam that I did buy

This software for PCs.
