The player of the partially-completed Wordle game wants some Pyret "assistance".  @link-instructions{Open the @starter-file{spell-checker} and click "Run".}

@n In the Interactions Area, test each of the three lines of code (below).

@n Which line of code would you recommend for the player? Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`alt-words("games", WORDS-ALL)`} }

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{because it returned the most suggestions.}}

@n The solution to the game above is "camel". Look back at the suggestions in your Interactions Area. Did any of the lists include it? 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. It's on the list from `WORDS-ALL`.}}

@n We used the very same function (`alt-words`) for each entry. Why didn't we receive the same results from all 3 expressions? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We gave the function different dictionaries each time.}}

@n To see the words in the `WORDS-100` dictionary, type `WORDS-100` into the Interactions Area and then click on `tree-set`. How many words are in this list?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{100. But they are numbered from 0 to 99.}}

@n What do you notice about the words in the list? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They are all 5 letter words and they're listed in alphabetical order.}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n What do you wonder? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n As you might have guessed, the `WORDS-1000` dictionary contains 1000 words and the `WORDS-ALL` dictionary contains even more (2314). How does that help explain the fact that `alt-words("games", WORDS-ALL)` returned the most suggestions? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Larger datasets have more information to draw from!}} 

@star Let's imagine that 

@indented{

- `this-word` and `that-word` represent two different five-letter words
- `alt-words(this-word, WORDS-ALL)` produces a list that includes `that-word`
}

@vspace{1ex}

Would you expect `alt-words(that-word, WORDS-ALL)` to produce a list that includes `this-word`? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If and only if both words are in the WORDS-ALL dataset!}} +
@fitb{}{} 

@star Can you produce an input that returns more than one word from the `WORDS-100` dictionary? If so, what is it? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary, but `alt-words("comic", WORDS-100)` will work.}}
