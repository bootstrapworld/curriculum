The very first spell checker would use misspelled words as inputs.

- *First*, it would develop alternative candidates for the misspelled word (input) by making one of the following adjustments: (1) replace a single letter with a different one, or (2) swap the positions of two adjacent letters.

- *Next*, it would search the provided dictionary to see which alternatives were valid options.

- *Finally*, it would produce a list of valid correctly spelled words for the user to choose from.

== Part 1: Follow the Algorithm 

@vspace{1ex}

*Misspelled Word: wello*

@n Generate alternative candidates for the misspelled word. _(These candidates don’t need to be real words!)_

@vspace{1ex}

- First, replace *one* letter from "wello" with a different one. _We’ve provided a first option to get you started._ 

@hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{dello} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{}

@vspace{1ex}

- Next, swap the positions of two *adjacent* letters. _Again, we've provided a first option to get you started._

@hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{ewllo} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em}

@n Circle the _actual_ words you listed above. How many real-word suggestions did you come up with? @fitb{}{}

@n You already found 5 "words" by replacing a single letter of *wello*. Using that strategy, about how many more could you list? 

@vspace{1ex}

@hspace{1em} about 10 more @hspace{3em} about 50 more @hspace{3em} about 100 more @hspace{3em} about 1000 more

@teacher{
A computer would generate 125 options. After replacing the first letter in the word with each of the letters in the alphabet, it would return the first letter to "w" and try replacing each of the other letters in the word with all of the other letters in the alphabet.

}


== Part 2: Reflect

@n What do you think are some limitations of this algorithm?

@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{There is an extremely limited number of ways in which a word can be misspelled. For example, if two separate letters in a word are incorrect, the spell checker has no chance of proposing the correct word!}
}

@n Compared to your own strategy for spell-checking, how similar / different is the first spell checker's algorithm? 

@blanklines{7}{@ifsoln{
When you check spelling, you rely a lot on context, instinct, and previously acquired knowledge. The first spell checking program did not have, or use, any of these strengths. In contrast, however, a human would not have the time, ability, or concentration to systematically list out thousands of potential words, whereas the computer has no difficulty doing so. Therefore, the strategies used by the human and computer may be extremely different for a similar task.
