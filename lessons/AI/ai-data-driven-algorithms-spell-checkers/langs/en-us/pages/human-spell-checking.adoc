== First Misspelled Word

@n What is the *first word that is spelled incorrectly* in the quote at the top? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{wello}} What was the _intended_ word? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{hello}} +
How did you know that that word was misspelled? Explain in as much detail as you can. @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{Sample responses: "wello" is not a word that I have encountered before; I know that from experience that it would make sense to say "hello" before class starts; "wello" and "hello" have four letters the same with just the first letter being different.}
}


@n Do you think a 6-year old would be able to identify and correct the first misspelled word in this sentence? Explain.  @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{Yes, a 6-year old would probably be able to identify the first misspelled word because it is a nonsense word--one that is not in the dictionary--so it sticks out. It doesn't make sense.}
}

== Second misspelled word

@n What is the *second word that is spelled incorrectly* in the quote at the top? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{thay}}  What was the _intended_ word? @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{they}} +
How did you know that that word was misspelled? Explain in as much detail as you can. @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{In this case, we need to have a good sense of spelling in English, and how phonetically correct spellings are not always actual words in the dictionary. To know that the word is misspelled, we must know the correct spelling, "they". Although "they" and "thay" sound identical, only one of the options ("they") is an actual word.}
}

@n Do you think a 6-year old would be able to identify and correct the second misspelled word in this sentence? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{No. "Thay" is not a word in the dictionary, but if we sound it out phonetically, the word produced would be identical to another word that does make sense here -- "they." That would be challenging for a young child to notice.}
}

== Reflect

@n You probably didn't need a dictionary to correct the two errors above. When might consulting a dictionary be a part of your spell-checking process? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@ifsoln{Technical words, words specific to a particular content area, or even common words that you are not sure how to spell.}
