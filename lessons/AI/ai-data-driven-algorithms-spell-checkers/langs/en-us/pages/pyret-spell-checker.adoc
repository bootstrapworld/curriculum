= A Pyret Spell Checker: The Algorithm

@link-instructions{Open the @starter-file{spell-checker} and click "Run".} Follow each of the instructions below to discover how our very own Pyret spell checker works.

@n In the @starter-file{spell-checker}, the function `alt-words` consumes a string and a dictionary... but what does it produce?

- Test `alt-words("straw", WORDS)` in the Interactions Area and record the results in the left column of the table below.
- In the second column, describe how each option differs from the input string ("straw").
- In the third column, record how many edits to the string "straw" this algorithm makes. _(A single edit could entail replacing one letter with a different one, for instance.)_

}

@n Test `alt-words("planet", WORDS)` in the Interactions Area.

- Notice that "planet" has six letters, but all of the suggested words have five letters. What else can you conclude about the spell checker's algorithm?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{One of the edits can be the deletion of a letter.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The spell checker only proposes five-letter words.}}
- To get from "planet" to "plait", delete @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{n}} and change @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{e}} to @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{i}}.
- To get from "planet" to "plank", delete @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{t}} and change @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{e}} to @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{k}}.
- The spell checker makes just _one_ edit when it proposes @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{"plane"}} as a match for "planet".

*Experiment with the `alt-words` function to answer the questions below, testing what it produces using Strings from your imagination.*

@n We have seen multiple two-edit changes. Does the program propose words that include three edits? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@n What is the maximum length string that this spell checker will accept? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{7 letters}}

- Why does that maximum length make sense with what we know about the algorithm? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A 7-letter word would require two deletions, using both of the available edits.}}

@n What else do you notice? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are words for which the spellchecker offers no suggestions (e.g. "octagon").}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{And there are words for which it proposes long lists.}}

@n The Pyret spell check program does not use the same algorithm as the @printable-exercise{first-spell-checker.adoc}. How are the programs different?  

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The first spell checker would only propose one adjustment, whereas the Pyret spell checker proposes two.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Pyret can delete letters, while the first spell checker could not. Pyret also only proposes 5-letter words,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{while the first spell checker did not have a letter limit.}}

@n *Edit distance* is a word programmers use to describe the number of operations needed to transform one string into another string. How can *edit distance* help us measure similarity? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A low edit distance indicates that two strings are very similar,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and a high edit distance indicates that two strings are very different.}}
