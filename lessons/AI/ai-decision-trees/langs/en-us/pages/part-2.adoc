== For Teens - Is Shopping History or Interest in Game a better Indicator?

@n Use the decision stumps below to make rules that predict whether or not teens would buy the game based on each category.

| Predict that 											

- new teenage customers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / won't} buy
- previous teenage customers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will not}}{will / won't} buy

| Predict that 

- interested teenage shoppers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / won't} buy
- uninterested teenage shoppers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will not}}{will / won't} buy

Place a checkmark below each value that the computer would predict correctly. 

@n Use the decision stumps to determine how well each rule predicts whether or not teens would buy the game.

| For our training data, this rule 

- would make @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{4}} correct predictions out of 5 attempts 
- is @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{80}} % accurate
| For our training data, this rule 

- would make @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{5}} correct predictions out of 5 attempts 
- is @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{100}} % accurate

@n Will you use shopping history or interest for your second decision node for teens? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Interest in game.}}

== For People in their Thirties - Is Shopping History or Interest in Game a better Indicator?

@n Complete the decision stumps below to make rules that predict whether or not people in their thirties would buy the game.
