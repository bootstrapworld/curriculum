= Exploring the Model

Use @starter-file{plagiarism} to respond to the questions, below.

== distance-to

@n In the Interactions Area, type `distance-to(student-essay)`. The table that appears displays the angle difference between `student-essay` and each of the other animal articles in the corpus. Use the information to fill in the blanks, below.

[cols="5,5,3", options="header", stripes="none"]
|===

|
| *article*
| *angle difference*

| most similar to `student-essay`
| @ifsoln{`elephant-article`}
| @ifsoln{~23.706°}

| most different from `student-essay`
| @ifsoln{`hamster-article`}
| @ifsoln{~77.620°}

|===

@n In the Interactions Area, type `distance-to(chimpanzee-article)`. One of the angle differences listed in the table that appears is zero. What does that tell you? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{When two articles have an angle difference of 0°, their bags of words are identical.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In this case, `chimpanzee-article` has an angle difference of 0° from itself.}}

@n Use the output of `distance-to(chimpanzee-article)` to fill in the blanks, below.

[cols="5,5,3", options="header", stripes="none"]

| *article*
| *angle difference*

| most similar to `chimpanzee-article`
| @ifsoln{`giraffe-article`}
| @ifsoln{~59.206°}

| @ifsoln{`rhino-article`}
| @ifsoln{~72.619°}

@n Is `distance-to` sophisticated enough to be able to determine with certainty whether or not plagiarism occurred? Explain. 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. If two essays have an unusually small angle difference, that is a signal for a human to investigate further.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A plagiarism detector cannot conclusively decide if plagiarism occurred.}}

@n Can you think of any ways to improve this model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students may propose giving more weight to important words.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{They may propose eliminating unimportant words from the analysis. Students may suggest somehow incorporating synonyms into the model,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{or analyzing sentence structure for similarity. Responses will vary.}}


== string-to-bag-cleaned

@n In the Interactions Area, type `string-to-bag(snail-article)`.

@indented{

a) How many unique words are used in the snail article? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{41 words}}

b) List each word that is used 2 or more times in the article. We've provided the first three: @fitb{}{a (2), and (3), be (3),}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{can (2), found (2), greater(2), in (2), of (4), snail (2), snails (3), the (3)}}

c) What do you Notice about the commonly used words? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They include 2 types of words:}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{words that are commonly used across the English language, and words that are of particular relevance to the article (snails)}}

@fitb{}{}
}

@n In the Interactions Area, type `string-to-bag-cleaned(snail-article)`.

@indented{
a) Notice that there are fewer unique words listed. How many unique words are on the table now? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{25 words}}

b) List each word that appears 2 or more times, now: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{found (2), greater (2), snail (2), snails (3)}}
