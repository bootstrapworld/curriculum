| What do you Notice?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{All of the documents with six words form a line when I plot their points! Points F, E, and J are sort of clustered around point C (which has the same location as Point D.)}

What do you Wonder?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{What does it means when points form a line? What does it means when points are close together? What about when they are far apart?}

@n Jane loves song A and wants to listen to a song that is similar. 

- Sierra suggests song H, claiming that it is similar to song A because five of its six words are the same.

- Jaden recommends song B. He says those two songs are similar because they are the only songs that have just one word! 

Who do you agree with?

@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{Students can reasonably agree with either Sierra or Jaden, depending on whether they think the _specific lyrics_ define song A, or if its repetitive nature is what defines song A. Some students may contest that it is too difficult to determine similarity with such limited information -- also a valid point. If your students discuss the actual distance of the different points on the coordinate plane, they are thinking like programmers!}
