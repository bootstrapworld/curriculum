== Determine Closeness

@n Use `cosine-similarity` to compare the student-submitted essay with the wikipedia article. Click "Run". What does the program tell you about the comparison? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`cosine-similarity(student-essay, wiki-article)` produces an output of ~0.97087...,}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ indicating that the texts are extremely close.}}

@n Did you know that "pachyderm" is a synonym for "elephant"? The student who wrote `student-essay-2` replaced all instances of "elephant" with "pachyderm". Use `cosine-similarity` to compare `student-essay-2` and `wiki-article`. What does the program tell you about the comparison?

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{`cosine-similarity(student-essay, wiki-article)` produces an output of ~0.7961..., meaning that the texts are still close enough to raise suspicion.
}
}

@n Your turn! Change the wikipedia article on your own by editing, adding to, and deleting from the text provided in the Definitions Area (`my-essay`). Use `cosine-similarity` to compare your text to the original `wiki-article`. Do you think your version of the elephants essay raise suspicion? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +
