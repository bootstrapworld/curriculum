= The Importance of Human Judgment

== How Many Dimensions?

@vspace{1ex}

A teacher asks students to write an essay on one of three topics: modern art, soccer, or zebras. The teacher feeds the essays to a plagiarism detector *to compare the essays to one another.* It plots 32 points in a 1023-dimensional space.

@n What does the number 32 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher has provided the plagiarism detector with 32 student essays.}}

@n What does the number 1023 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{In sum, the essays include 1023 different words.}}

@n After thinking on it, the teacher realizes that students don't merely copy one another's writing; instead, they copy/paste text from the internet! The teacher opens her plagiarism detection software and tells it to consume a large @vocab{training corpus} of internet text about modern art, soccer, and zebras. How many dimensions will the space contain, now?

@vspace{1ex}

*Circle one:* @hspace{1em} more dimensions @hspace{5em}  the same amount of dimensions @hspace{5em} fewer dimensions

@n Explain your choice. @fitb{}{} +
@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{The space will contain more dimensions. For a bag-of-words model, dimensionality reflects how many different words are in the corpus. We can assume that a large corpus of internet text will use more words than the students in the teacher's class did.

== Assessing the Output

@vspace{1ex}

Consider each of the four outputs, below. What do you think is happening in each of scenarios? How would you advise the teacher?

@n The points are scattered seemingly randomly all over a 1023-dimensional space, with no apparent clustering.

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{The models for the documents are not close; students appear to have written essays with a range of different words that appear in varying frequencies. The teacher should have no need to worry.
}
}

@n The points are scattered seemingly randomly, but there are two points plotted extremely close together.

@blanklines{4}{
@ifsoln{With the exception of two essays, students appear to have written essays with a range of different words that appear in varying frequencies. The teacher should focus on those two essays. Observe that the similarity is of the models, but the documents themselves may be quite different. Therefore, the teacher should carefully examine the corresponding documents. If the documents are not similar, the closeness of the points is probably a coincidence.
}
}


@n There appear to be three large, loose clusters of randomly plotted points. +
@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{One likely explanation is that the three large, loose clusters represent the three different topics: modern art, zebras, and soccer. Students who write about one topic are likely to use similar terminology, and that terminology will differ by topic. Since our three topics are extremely different, we should expect little overlap in specialized terminology between them (although the “English”) parts will likely be quite similar). The teacher should have no need to worry.
}
}

@n There appear to be two large, loose clusters of randomly plotted points, with one point positioned far away from the two clusters. +
@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{Perhaps one of the topics was far less popular than the others, and only one student opted to write about that topic. The teacher should have no need to worry.
}
