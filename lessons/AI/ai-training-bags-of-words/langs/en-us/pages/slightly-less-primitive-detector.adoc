= A Slightly Less Primitive Plagiarism Detector

@link-instructions{
Open @starter-file{plagiarism}. Click "Run".}

== Reviewing `simple-similarity`

@n Type `doc-a` into the Interactions Area, then hit "Enter". What appears? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"doo doo be doo be"}} +
@n Type `doc-b` into the Interactions Area, then hit "Enter". What appears? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"doo be doo be doo"}}

@n If we compare these two documents using our `simple-equality` function, what do you predict the outcome will be... and why? +
@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{Students should predict that the output will be `false` because the documents are not identical.
}
}

@n Type `simple-equality(doc-a, doc-b)`. What is the output? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{false}}


== Testing `string-to-bag` and `bag-equality`


@n This starter file uses the function `string-to-bag`, which converts a string into a bag of words. Type `string-to-bag(doc-a)` in the Interactions Area and hit "Enter". What is the output? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table with a "word" column and a "frequency" column, indicating that "be" occurs}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{twice and "doo" occurs 3 times.}}

@n Type `string-to-bag(doc-b)` in the Interactions Area and hit "Enter". What do you observe? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table with a "word" column}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and a "frequency" column, indicating that "be" occurs twice and "doo" occurs 3 times.}}

@n The function `bag-equality` checks if two different bags of words are identical. What do you predict the output will be when you use `doc-a` and `doc-b` as the arguments for `bag-equality`? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{true}} Were you correct? @fitb{5em}{}

== Assessing the model on our elephants texts

@n Use `string-to-bag` to build one bag of words for the `wiki-article`, and another for the `student-essay`. Do the bags of words appear to be identical to you, or not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They are close but not identical. In the `student-essay`, "which" appears twice but it never appears,}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{in the `wiki-article`.}}

@n Our `simple-equality` function returned `false` when we compared `wiki-article` with `student-essay`, because the two documents are not identical. What do you predict that `bag-equality` will produce, when we compare `wiki-article` with `student-essay`? Why? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Use `bag-equality` to compare `wiki-article` and `student-essay`. Was your prediction correct? @fitb{}{}

== Reflect

@n How is the `bag-equality` plagiarism detector different from our primitive `simple-equality` plagiarism detector? How is it similar? +
@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{Different: The bag-equality plagiarism detector compares two bag-of-words summaries, rather than simply comparing two texts. +
Similar: Like our primitive plagiarism detector, it checks for identicality. It determines if the two bags of words are identical or not.
