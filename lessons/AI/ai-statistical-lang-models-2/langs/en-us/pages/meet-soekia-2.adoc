= Meet Soekia! (Continued)

Respond to the prompts below by interacting with @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/SoekiaGPT/}

== N-Grams

The orange _N-grams_ panel is where Soekia lists out possible n-grams and their frequency of occurrence within the training corpus. The default setting ("3rd") produces a list of every trigram that appears in the training corpus. 

@n The most common trigram appears at the top of the list. Click on it. What do you learn? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{I can see how many times the trigram appears,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and in which documents.}}

@n Select "4" to indicate that you want Soekia to create 4-grams. Click the red "Create N-grams" button on the right side of the N-Grams panel. When you click this button, Soekia processes the documents one at a time (illustrated by red circles appearing on each document), producing all possible 4-grams. What is the most common 4-gram in the corpus? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Lord Marquis of Carabas}}

@n Take a minute to explore the N-Grams Panel, by scrolling through the list of N-Grams and clicking on some other examples. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@ifsoln{
*Possible Noticings:* Punctuation counts as a word! The green bar under each trigram indicates how often it appears in the corpus. The most common trigram appears almost as twice as frequently as the next most common trigram. *Possible Wonderings:* Why does Soekia interpret a line break (>) as a word? Why do individual 5-grams appear so much less frqeuently than individual unigrams?

== Suggested words

In the _Suggested words_ panel, Soekia offers possible completions for different inputs.

@n Click on one of the suggestions. What information appears? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We learn how many times the suggestion is used in the training corpus, }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and in which document it appears.}}

@n Click the "Customize Selections" button. Set a *low* temperature then click the right-facing arrow to tell a fairy tale. Once a few sentences have appeared, read your story and rate it: @hspace{2em} _It makes no sense._ @hspace{2em} _It sort of makes sense?_ @hspace{2em} _Wow! It makes sense!_

@n Click the trash can icon to delete the story. Now, set the temperature to *high*, and click the right-facing arrow to tell another fairy tale. After a few sentences, read it and rate it:  @hspace{2em} _It makes no sense._ @hspace{2em} _It sort of makes sense?_ @hspace{2em} _Wow! It makes sense!_

@n Spend some time clicking and exploring the _Suggested words_ panel. What do you Notice about the _Suggested words_ panel? What do you Wonder about the _Suggested words_ panel?

@ifsoln{Possible Noticings: The _Suggested words_ panel updates automatically as Soekia generates text. Soekia often suggests a 5-gram and the shorter n-grams that are contained within that 5-gram (e.g., "the wind in the trees", "wind in the trees", "in the trees" and "trees"). Possible Wonderings: What are the different ways that I can customize the selection? How does changing the temperature affect the output?
