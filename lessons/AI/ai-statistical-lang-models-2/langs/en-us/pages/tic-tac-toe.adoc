== Soekia & Tic-Tac-Toe 

In the _Documents_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/collection-icon.png,15} and select @image{../images/grid-icon.png, 15} (second from the bottom of the drop down menu).
- When asked to confirm that you want to "Load New Collection?" click "continue".

@n Describe what you see. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are twenty-six documents (A-Z). Document A is the same tic-tac-toe game we already played.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each document is a different color. It looks like they probably all narrate different possible tic-tac-toe games.}}

@n How are the documents of the tic-tac-toe collection *similar* to the documents of the fairy tale collection? How are they *different*? 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both types of documents contain letters from the alphabet. The fairy tale documents contain sentences and paragraphs of words in English.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The tic-tac-toe documents use a special notation (made up of letters and numbers) to represent the moves of the tic-tac-toe game.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both document types can interpreted as a series of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.}}

In the _Generate Text_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/send-icon.png, 15} to tell Soekia to generate a set of game moves. 
- Click ▶️ *abc-TicTacToe-player* (beneath the list of moves) to see a visualization of the game you just generated. 

@n In what ways does the game seem *similar* to a normal game of tic-tac-toe? In what ways does it seem *different*?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{*Similarities:* Xs and Os alternate, gradually filling up the board. *Differences:* The game keeps adding Xs and Os after the grid is already filled up until all 45 moves from the list have been used up!

== Thinking About Natural Language Processing 

In the _Documents_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/collection-icon.png,15} and select @image{../images/music-icon.png,15} from the dropdown menu. Then click "continue" to load the new collection.

In the _Generate Text_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/send-icon.png, 15} to tell Soekia to write you some music. Click ▶️ *abc-Music-Player* to try playing your composition.
 
@n What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n @right{@image{../images/repeat-sign.png, 75}}In musical notation, a "repeat sign" (pictured on right) indicates that a section of the music should be repeated. Does Soekia's music player repeat sections of the music when it arrives at a repeat sign? Why or why not? 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No, Soekia does not repeat sections of the music. Soekia does not know anything about making music!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It is simply adhering to the rules of probability to generate songs.}}

In the _Documents_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/collection-icon.png,15} and select @image{../images/chess-icon.png,15} from the bottom of the dropdown menu. Then click "continue" to load the new collection.

In the _Generate Text_ panel, 

- Click @image{../images/send-icon.png, 15} to tell Soekia to generate a set of chess moves. Click ▶️ *abc-Chess-Player* to visualize the game. 
 
@n In actual chess, a player starts with two knights and there is no way to gain additional knights. How come additional knights sometimes appear in this chess game?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If Soekia's algorithm dictates that a knight needs to be moved, Soekia finds a way to move a knight!}}
