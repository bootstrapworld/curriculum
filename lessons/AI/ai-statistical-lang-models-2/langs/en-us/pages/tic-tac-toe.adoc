= What Makes a Language?

Respond to the prompts below by interacting with @link{http://bootstrapworld.org/SoekiaGPT/}.

== Soekia & Tic-Tac-Toe 

@n Describe what you see in the Documents panel. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are twenty-six documents (A-Z). Document A is the same tic-tac-toe game we already played.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each document is a different color. It looks like they probably all narrate different possible tic-tac-toe games.}}

@n How are the documents of the tic-tac-toe collection _similar_ to the documents of the fairy tale collection? How are they _different_? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both types of documents contain letters from the alphabet. The fairy tale documents contain sentences and paragraphs of words in English.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The tic-tac-toe documents use a special notation (made up of letters and numbers) to represent the moves of the tic-tac-toe game.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both document types can interpreted as a series of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.}}

@n Beneath the list of moves, you'll see ▶️ *abc-TicTacToe-player*. Click on it to see a visualization of the game you just generated. In what ways does the game seem like a normal game of tic-tac-toe? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Xs and Os alternate, gradually filling up the board.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n In what ways does the game seem *different* from a normal tic-tac-toe game? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The game keeps adding Xs and Os after the grid is already filled up until all 45 moves from the list have been used up!}}

== Thinking About Natural Language Processing 

@n In the _Documents_ panel, open the "Music in ABC Notation" training corpus. In the _Generate Text_ panel, tell Soekia to write you some music by clicking the right-facing arrow. Try playing your composition using the ▶️ *abc-Music-Player*. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{}

@n @right{@image{../images/repeat-sign.png, 75}}In musical notation, a "repeat sign" (pictured on right) indicates that a section of the music should be repeated. Does Soekia's music player repeat sections of the music when it arrives at a repeat sign? Why or why not? 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No, Soekia does not repeat sections of the music. Soekia does not know anything about making music!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It is simply adhering to the rules of probability to generate songs.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Access the "Chess" collection of documents in Soekia's _Documents_ panel. (Its icon is at the bottom of the list.) Play a game of chess by clicking the right-facing arrow in the _Generate text_ panel. Click the ▶️ *abc-Chess-Player* to visualize the game. In actual chess, a player starts with two knights and there is no way gain additional knights. How come additional knights sometimes appear in this chess game?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If Soekia's algorithm dictates that a knight needs to be moved, Soekia finds a way to move a knight!}}
