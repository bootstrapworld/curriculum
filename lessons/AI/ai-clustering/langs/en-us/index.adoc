= Clustering

@description{COMING SOON. Students explore how clustering, a method that builds on students’ understanding of averages, can uncover patterns and structures in data. They apply this method to geographic data on cities.}

== Clustering Cities on Earth

=== Overview

=== Launch

One member of an advanced alien civilization has been tasked with listening to Earth through radio transmissions. The alien collects @handout{alien-cities-data.adoc, "some data"} about cities on Earth.

The alien has made some observations while listening to the radio transmitter.

- All of the city names begin with a "B" sound.
- Cricket (a bat-and-ball game) is beautiful and important.
- The major cricket cities are Bengaluru, Bridgetown, Brisbane, and Bulawayo.

The alien wants to find some structure among the data, and wonders if Earthlings have socio-political structures organized by general proximity.

The alien makes an assumption -- that Earthlings must put their capitals near the major cricket cities -- and uses an algorithm  to try to find what places are “close”, putting all cities in one of four groups arranged by proximity to see what regions emerge.

=== Investigate

- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{clustering-cities.adoc}.

Clustering is a method of unsupervised machine learning that groups unlabeled data based on similarity.The groups have "averages", which we call centroids. During the activity with the cities, centroids appeared as solid colored dots on the map.

With unsupervised learning, there is no notion of meaning. The computer analyzes an unlabeled dataset to discover patterns, which may or may not be useful. Whether the result of unsupervised learning is useful or not requires some human interpretation. For instance, sometimes averages are incredibly useful, and other times they are incredibly misleading.

=== Synthesize
