= Clustering Cities

== Alien Data

One member of an advanced alien civilization has been tasked with listening to Earth through radio transmissions. The alien collects @handout{alien-cities-data.adoc, "some data"} about cities on Earth.

@vspace{1ex}

The alien has also made some observations while listening to the radio transmitter.

- All of the city names begin with a "B" sound.
- Cricket (a bat-and-ball game) is beautiful and important.
- The major _cricket_ cities are Bengaluru, Bridgetown, Brisbane, and Bulawayo.

@vspace{1ex}

The alien wants to find some structure among the data, and wonders if Earthlings have socio-political structures organized by general proximity.

@vspace{1ex}

The alien makes an assumption -- that Earthlings must put their capitals near the major cricket cities -- and uses *an algorithm* to try to find what places are “close”, putting all cities in one of four groups arranged by proximity to see what regions emerge. _You will learn more about this algorithm today!_

== The Alien's Algorithm

@n Type `go([list: "Bridgetown", "Bengaluru", "Bulawayo", "Brisbane"])` into the Interactions area, then press enter.

@n Each group is called a _cluster_. As Earthlings, we can see the sensible structure:

- cities in the Americas are all *brown*
- cities in Europe, western Asia, and Africa are all @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{blue}}
- cities in central to eastern Asia are @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{red}}
- the city in @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{purple}} is on a continent of its own (Australia)

@n The solid colored dots show the *centroid* of each cluster. What do you think a centroid is? @fitb{}{}

@n What if we give three cities as starting points for our clustering? Type `go([list:  "Bridgetown", "Bengaluru", "Bloemfontein"])`. Describe how the cities are clustered. @fitb{}{}

@n What if we start with just two cities, Beijing and Busan? Type `go([list:  "Beijing", "Busan"])`. Describe how the cities are clustered. @fitb{}{}

@star Can you find a partition such that Beijing and Busan end up in different clusters? @fitb{}{}
