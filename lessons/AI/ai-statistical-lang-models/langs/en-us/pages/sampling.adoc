= Sampling from the Language Model

@link-instructions{Use @handout{old-lady-lyrics.adoc} to answer the questions, below. *Note that the title of the song is a part of the corpus!*}


== Text Generation Exercise #1

@n Let's start our text generation with the phrase "She ". Determine which word is most likely to follow "She ": @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{swallowed}}

@n What word most likely follows the word you wrote in the second blank? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{a}}

@n Use statistical language modeling to determine the fourth word: @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{fly}}

@n Record your text generation in the spaces below:

*Text Generation 1*: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{She}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{swallowed}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{a}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{fly}}

@n Everyone in your class should have generated the *same* text. Why do you think that was the outcome?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The corpus included a lot of repetition. Every single time we saw the word "She", it was followed by "swallowed".}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There were no instances when two different words had the same likelihood of following a given word.}}

@fitb{}{}


== Text Generation Exercise #2

@n Below is a list of the most common unigrams in the corpus. This time, let's start by choosing the *most* common word: @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{The}}

- "the": 15 times
- "a": 13 times
- "she": 11 times

@n What word most likely follows the word you just chose? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{spider}}

@n How many times does "That" follow "spider"? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{3}} How many times does "to" follow "spider"? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{3}}

@n There is an equal probability of choosing "to" and "that"! Flip a coin to decide between them. What did you pick? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{to / that}}

@n Use statistical language modeling to determine the fourth word: @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{catch / wriggled}}

@n Transfer your responses above onto the blank spaces below. @teacher{Some students will have the 2a response in the 2b blanks, and vice versaâ€” which is fine!}


*Text Generation 2a*: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{The}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{spider}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{to}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{catch}}


@n Some of your classmates probably generated a different four-word phrase than you did! Use statistical language modeling to determine the _other_ four-word phrase. Write it in the blanks spaces below.


*Text Generation 2b*: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{The}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{spider}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{that}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{wriggled}}


@n Why do you think *Text Generation Exercise 1* _always_ produced the same result, but *Text Generation Exercise 2* resulted in more than one possible outcome?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In *Text Generation Exercise 2*, there was a "tie" for the most likely next word after "spider", whereas *Text Generation Exercise 1*}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{was completely deterministic.}}

@fitb{}{}

@star What is another starting word that would result in only one possible four-word phrase? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{was, an, old, lady, who}}

@star What is another starting word that would result in at least two possible outcomes? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{and, cat}}
