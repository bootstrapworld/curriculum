@n Describe what you see in the Documents panel. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are twenty-six documents (A-Z). Document A is the same tic-tac-toe game we already played.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each document is a different color. It looks like they probably all narrate different possible tic-tac-toe games.}}

Scroll left to the blue "Generate text" panel. Click the right-facing arrow (&#x27A4;) to play tic-tac-toe.

- Some of the moves in your tic-tac-toe game may be highlighted with different colors (green, pink, orange, etc).
- If this is not the case, click the eye icon beneath the generated text.

@n Why do you think the words are shaded in different colors? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The colors match those of the 26 documents.}}

@n When the game finishes, hover your mouse over one or two of the colorful moves in the tic-tac-toe game. What appears?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The name of the Document that the move was "learned" from.}}

@n Scroll right to the orange "N-grams" panel. Click "1st", to produce a list of unigrams. What is the most common unigram? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{X13}}

@n Click on the green line beneath a few of the unigrams in the orange panel. What does the length of the green line indicate? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The green line's length indicates how many documents contain the unigram.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Xs and Os alternate.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n In what ways does the game seem *different* from a normal tic-tac-toe game? @fitb{}{}
