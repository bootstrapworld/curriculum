== Documents and Text Generation

@n Describe what you see in the Documents panel. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are four documents (A, B, C, and D). Document A is the same tic-tac-toe game we already played.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each document is a different color. It looks like they probably all narrate different possible tic-tac-toe games.}}

Scroll left to the blue "Generate text" panel. Click the right-facing arrow (&#x27A4;) to play tic-tac-toe.

- Some of the moves in your tic-tac-toe game may be highlighted with different colors (green, pink, orange, etc).
- If this is not the case, click the eye icon beneath the generated text.

@n Why do you think the words are shaded in different colors? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They seem to match the colors of the 4 documents.}}

@n When the game finishes, hover your mouse over one or two of the colorful moves in the tic-tac-toe game. What appears?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The name of the Document that the move was "learned" from.}}
