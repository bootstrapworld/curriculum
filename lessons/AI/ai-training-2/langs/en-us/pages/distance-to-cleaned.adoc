== Part 1: chimpanzee-article

Let's compare the output of `distance-to(chimpanzee-article)` with the output of `distance-to-cleaned(chimpanzee-article)`.

@n On both output tables, the angle produced in the "chimpanzee" row is zero. Why? @fitb{}{}

== Part 2: mystery-article

Follow the steps below to make some discoveries about the `mystery-article`.

@n Type `distance-to(mystery-article)` in the Interactions Area. Look at the different angle measurements produced. Do you notice any outliers? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Yes}} Explain. @fitb{}{}

@n Think back to when you compared `student-essay` with `elephant-article`. Those two paragraphs were virtually identical, which resulted in an angle difference of about 5°. The difference between these two vectors (`giraffe-article` and `mystery-essay`) is much greater, but still seems unusual. Can you make any hypotheses about mystery-essay? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Let’s investigate further. Type `distance-to-cleaned(mystery-essay)`. What do you notice? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Time for the reveal! Type `mystery-essay` into the Interactions Area. Why was the angle difference between this article and `giraffe-article` small? @fitb{}{}
