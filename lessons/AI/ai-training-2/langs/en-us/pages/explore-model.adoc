== distance-to

@n In the Interactions Area, type `distance-to(student-essay)`. The table that appears displays the angle difference between `student-essay` and each of the other animal articles in the corpus.

@indented{
a) Which article is the _most similar_ to student-essay? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`elephant-article`}}

b) What is the angle difference between `student-essay` and the _most similar_ article in the corpus? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~23.706°}}

c) Which article is the _most different_ from `student-essay`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`hamster-article`}}

d) What is the angle difference between `student-essay` and the _most different_ article? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~77.620°}}
}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{polar bear, rhino, blue whale, giraffe, manatee, chimpanzee, badger, snail}}

@fitb{}{}


@n In the Interactions Area, type `distance-to(chimpanzee-article)`.

@indented{
a) One of the angle differences listed in the table is zero. What does that tell you? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{When two articles have an angle difference of 0°,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{their bags of words are identical. In this case, `chimpanzee-article` has an angle difference of 0° from itself.}}

b) Which article is the most similar to `chimpanzee-article`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`giraffe-article`}}

c) What is the angle difference between `chimpanzee-article` and the _most similar_ article? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~59.206°}}

d) Which article is the most different from chimpanzee-article? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`rhino-article`}}

e) What is the angle difference between `chimpanzee-article` and the _most different_ article? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~72.619°}}
}

== string-to-bag-cleaned

@n In the Interactions Area, type `string-to-bag(snail-article)`.

@indented{

a) How many unique words are used in the snail article? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{41 words}}

b) List each word that is used 2 or more times in the article. We've provided the first three: @fitb{}{a (2), and (3), be (3),}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{can (2), found (2), greater(2), in (2), of (4), snail (2), snails (3), the (3)}}

c) What do you Notice about the commonly used words? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They include 2 types of words:}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{words that are commonly used across the English language, and words that are of particular relevance to the article (snails)}}

@fitb{}{}
}

@indented{
a) Notice that there are fewer unique words listed. How many unique words are on the table now? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{23 words}}

b) List each word that appears 2 or more times, now: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{found (2), greater (2), snail (2), snails (3)}}
