= The Importance of Human Judgment

== How Many Dimensions?

@vspace{1ex}

A teacher asks students to write an essay on one of three topics: modern art, soccer, or zebras. The teacher feeds the essays to a plagiarism detector *to compare the essays to one another.* It plots 32 points in a 1023-dimensional space.

@n What does the number 32 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher has provided the plagiarism detector with 32 student essays.}}

@n What does the number 1023 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{In sum, the essays include 1023 different words.}}

@n After thinking on it, the teacher realizes that students don't merely copy one another's writing; instead, they copy/paste text from the internet! The teacher opens her plagiarism detection software and tells it to consume a large @vocab{training corpus} of internet text about modern art, soccer, and zebras. How many dimensions will the space contain, now?

@vspace{1ex}

*Circle one:* @hspace{1em} more dimensions @hspace{5em}  the same amount of dimensions @hspace{5em} fewer dimensions

@n Explain your choice. 

@blanklines{4}{
@ifsoln{The space will contain more dimensions. For a bag-of-words model, dimensionality reflects how many different words are in the corpus. We can assume that a large corpus of internet text will use more words than the students in the teacher's class did.}

|===
| The 32 points are evenly scatter all over the 1023-dimensional space, with no apparent clustering.
|*1* @ifsoln{D}||*A*
| Essays about one topic are likely to use similar words, but essays about different topics likely use different words. The three clusters probably represent the three different topics (modern art, zebras, and soccer).


| The points are clustered into three groups, but two of the points are almost on top of one another.
|*2* @ifsoln{B}||*B*
| Two of the essays use almost the same words, in almost the same frequencies. This is probably plagiarism, and the teacher should take a closer look at those essays.


| The points are clustered into three groups.
|*3* @ifsoln{A}||*C*
| Only one student opted to write about a particular topic, while the rest of the class wrote essays on the other two. There is no evidence of plagiarism.


| Almost all the points are clustered into two groups, but one point is positioned very far away from both clusters.
|*4* @ifsoln{C}||*D*
| Every student appears to have written essays about entirely different topics! The teacher has no reason to suspect plagiarism, but they should _probably_ worry about their students ignoring the assignment!
