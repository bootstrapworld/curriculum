= Designing a Song Recommendation System


@n Think of a song that you know very well. @fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} Describe it in as much detail as you can.

- Begin with facts like the topic, musical genre, artist, year of release, language the lyrics are sung in, tempo, instruments used, etc.
- Then describe it more personally... for example, how it makes you feel, when you choose to listen / avoid listening to it, etc.
- Have fun!

@n A song recommendation system must aggregate a user's listening history, extracting data that is useful for making predictions about the user's music preferences. If you were designing a song recommendation system, what specific data would it store? Make a list of ideas. Then rank each item based on how heavily you think it should be weighted in your song prediction function.
