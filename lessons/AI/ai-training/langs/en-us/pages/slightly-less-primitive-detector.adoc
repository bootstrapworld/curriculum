Open @starter-file{plagiarism}. Click "Run".}

== Reviewing `simple-similarity`

@n Type `doc-a` into the Interactions Area, then hit "Enter". What appears? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

@n Type `doc-b` into the Interactions Area, then hit "Enter". What appears? @fitb{}{}

@n If we compare these two documents using our `simple-equality` function, what do you predict the outcome will be... and why?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Type `simple-equality(doc-a, doc-b)`. What is the output? @fitb{}{}


== Testing `string-to-bag` and `bag-equality`


@n This starter file uses the function `string-to-bag`, which converts a string into a bag of words. Type `string-to-bag(doc-a)` in the Interactions Area and select "Enter". What is the output? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"doo be doo be doo"}}

@fitb{}{}


@n Type `string-to-bag(doc-b)` in the Interactions Area and select "Enter". What do you observe? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{ "doo doo be doo be"}}

@fitb{}{}


@n Let's test out `bag-equality`, which checks if two different bags of words are identical or not. Use `bag-equality` to check if the bags of words for doc-a and doc-b are identical. What is the output? @fitb{}{}

== Assessing the model on our elephants texts

@n Use Pyret to build one bag of words for the `wiki-article`, and another for the `student-essay`. Do the bags of words appear to be identical to you, or not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Our `simple-equality` function returned `false` when we compared `wiki-article` with `student-essay`, because the two documents are not identical. What do you predict that `bag-equality` will produce, when we compare `wiki-article` with `student-essay`? @fitb{}{}
