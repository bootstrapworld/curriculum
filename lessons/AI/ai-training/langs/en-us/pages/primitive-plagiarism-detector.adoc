@n Do *you* think the student who submitted this essay on Elephants in Thailand committed plagiarism? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{These texts appear to}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{be identical, except that the student-submitted essay replaces "has been" with "is". Given the proximity of these texts, plagiarism seems likely.}}

== Detect Identicality
Open the @starter-file{plagiarism} and click "Run".

- The two paragraphs above are defined in the starter file as `wiki-article` and `student-essay`, respectively.
- The file also defines a function `simple-similarity`, which takes in two Strings and produces a Number:
  * 1 indicates that there is a match.
  * 0 indicates that there is not a match.

@n What would you expect to happen when you compare the wikipedia article to itself? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It should return `1`}}

@n What code would you need to write to use `simple-similarity` to compare the wikipedia article to itself. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`simple-similarity(wiki-article, wiki-article)`}}

@n What happens when you test it out in the Interactions Area? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It produces an output of 1, indicating that the texts are a match.}}

== Assess Program Effectiveness

@n What would you hope to happen when you compare the student essay to the wikipedia article? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It should return `1`,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{or somehow indicate that the two pieces of writing are nearly identical.}}

@n What code would you need to write to use `simple-similarity` to compare the `student-essay` with the `wiki-article`. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`simple-similarity(student-essay, wiki-article)`}}

@n What does the program tell you about the comparison? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It produces an output of 0, indicating that the texts are not a match.}}

@n What are some problems with this plagiarism detector? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This plagiarism detector has absolutely no nuance! It simply looks for a perfect match.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It does not pick up on word substitutions, additions, or deletions. It does not help us draw conclusions about whether plagiarism happened.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Describe what a more effective plagiarism detector must do. (Think creatively! How could you catch even the sneakiest of plagiarizers?)

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students' responses will vary, but should emphasize the idea that a more effective plagiarism detector will somehow capture the "closeness" }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{of two documents, rather than if they are identical.}}
