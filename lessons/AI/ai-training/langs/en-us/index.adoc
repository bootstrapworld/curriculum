== Song Recommendation Systems

@objective{training}

=== Overview

Students explore song recommendation, another example of data-driven algorithms at work. Students consider how data aggregation is a key component of machine learning.

=== Launch

Data is at the heart of @vocab{data science} and @vocab{data-driven algorithms} are at the heart of Machine Learning and AI.  When collecting, organizing, and drawing general conclusions from data with the help of computers, providing _more_ data often produces better results, but we must also consider how other variables can influence the quality of output.

@lesson-instruction{
- Read @printable-exercise{case-study-michelle.adoc}.
- Then respond to the questions, providing as much detail as you can.
}

@teacher{Invite students to share their responses.

- If their responses highlight that data-driven algorithms produce a higher quality output when we provide more data--great! Your students understood the key take-away from our @lesson-link{ai-data-driven-algorithms} lesson.
- Your students might bring new complexity to the conversation by acknowledging the possibility that a programmer's changes to the algorithm could have caused Michelle's increased satisfaction with her play list.
- If your students do *not* propose that Spotify's algorithm was updated (as we suggest in the answer key), that's okay! *There's no need to reveal that possibility immediately.* We recommend moving on with the lesson. After completing @printable-exercise{song-recommending.adoc}, you can circle back to @printable-exercise{case-study-michelle.adoc}.
}

=== Investigate

It's likely that Michelle could get better suggestions without Spotify making any changes to the code base. But it's also possible that changing the code would improve Michelle's experience!  Let's consider song recommendation in more depth and explore the idea that sometimes _there is a need for algorithms to change_.

@slidebreak

Very broadly, a song recommendation system does two things:

- aggregate a user's listening history to build a detailed profile of their musical tastes
- given a new song, determine whether or not to recommend that song

@slidebreak

What does building the profile for a listener entail?

@lesson-instruction{
- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{song-recommending.adoc}.
- First, you will think about what data could be collected about a song of your choosing.
- Then, you will (informally) design your own song recommendation system!
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What would your song recommendation system's algorithm prioritize?}
@A{Answers will vary!}
}

@slidebreak

@vocab{Training} is the act of transforming data into a model. As you discovered, song recommendation systems need @vocab{training} in order to make recommendations. In the case of Spotify, the model is a _summary_ of the user's listening habits. Using this model, Spotify answers questions about new, unseen data (e.g. Do we expect Michelle to like the latest Taylor Swift song... or not?).

When Michelle observed that Spotify must have updated its algorithms, she was *possibly* correct; we actually have no way of knowing what goes on behind the scenes at Spotify. Maybe the algorithm was altered to put more weight on _other_ listeners' behaviors, and less weight on the user's listening behaviors. Or maybe the designer realized they'd left out an important factor in predicting people's musical tastes and the algorithm was completely overhauled!

@teacher{If your students did not suggest that Spotify improved its algorithms on @printable-exercise{case-study-michelle.adoc}, now is an appropriate time to add some complexity and nuance to the conversation. Discuss the possibility that the algorithm changed a little
or a lot... and that there's no way for us to know!}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
In machine learning, we generally start with a large chunk of data. A model is then generated from the data. That model is generally expected to be a lot smaller than the original chunk of data (but it may still be huge!). The model can be queried from to get answers.
@Q{Why do you think models are generally smaller than the training data?}

@A{Generally, the model *summarizes* the data, eliminating all but its most essential features--the features that enable it to make predictions, generate text, etc.}

@Q{What advantages might there be to the model being smaller than the training data?}
@Q{What disadvantages might there be?}
}

== Bags of Words

@objective{bag-of-words}

=== Overview

Students practice thinking like a hacker to determine the basic requirements of a successful plagiarism detection program. They consider the "bag-of-words" model, which a user can query to better understand how similar or different two documents are.

=== Launch

As a student, you probably know what it feels like to be under surveillance.

- When you use the internet at your school or on a school-issued computer, software probably monitors your web use and blocks you from visiting a multitude of sites.
- When you take a test, it's likely proctored.
- When you submit an essay to your English or History teacher, you can expect that they will check for plagiarism - perhaps by running it through a plagiarism detector to be certain that all words and thoughts are your own.
- You might even got to a school where adults are stationed around the building and in the hallways or use cameras to check that students are dressed and behaving a certain way.

@slidebreak

Good designers of these systems have to practice adversarial thinking and imagine all the ways that someone might try to _hack_ or _fool_ them.  Let's practice thinking like a designer.

@QandA{

@Q{Imagine that your teacher announces that they will be running all student writing through a plagiarism detector and you are a student who wants to plagiarize. Exercise some creativity: What are your strategies for evading detection?}

@A{Responses will vary, but may include the following:
  - replace common words with synonyms
  - change the ordering of sentences and paragraphs
  - plagiarize from an unlikely source (maybe a friend who took the class 5 years ago?)
  - plagiarize from multiple sources
  - paraphrase text so that it has the correct "voice".
  }
}

@strategy{Adversarial Thinking}{
Go easy on your students! As students share their plagiarism strategies, you may feel judgmental. We urge you to keep those feelings at bay.

In this exercise, we are trying to get students to engage in *Adversarial Thinking* (put simply, thinking like a hacker). This is a valuable strategy that is taught, for example, in cybersecurity courses at the university level focused on security, data protection, harms caused by AI, etc. Adversarial Thinking is a valuable skill for students to develop; the key is that they learn how to exercise it in an ethical way!

Just because students excel at thinking in this way doesn't mean they are ethically compromised. Focus on and commend their creativity and reasoning instead of judging them.
}

@slidebreak

To understand the workings of plagiarism detection, we'll start by looking at a simple detector.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{plagiarism}.
- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{primitive-plagiarism-detector.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak

@teacher{Debrief the page with your class.}

@QandA{
@Q{What does the `simple-equality` detector do?}
@A{Takes in two documents and returns 1 if they match exactly and 0 if they don't match exactly.}
@Q{How would you evaluate the effectiveness of the `simple-equality` detector?}
@A{It doesn't work very well! We have know way of knowing how similar the documents are unless they are an exact match. Whether two documents are almost identical or have nothing in common, we will be told that they aren't a match.}
@Q{What might a more effective plagiarism detector do differently?}
@A{Answers will vary.}
}

@slidebreak

As we discussed, plagiarizers usually alter at least a few words of the original document. Sometimes they change the ordering of the text, and sometimes they delete a sentence or word here and there.

- If the `simple-equality` detector finds a match, we can be certain that an identical document exists.
- If the detector does not find a match, we know that there are no identical documents.
- _Either way, we can't draw any conclusions about whether plagiarism happened!_

*We need a plagiarism detector with more sophistication!*

Rather than detecting identicality, we need to determine the _closeness_ of two documents. To do that, we need a way to summarize each document, and then compute the distance between the summaries.

=== Investigate

One standard way to summarize a document is by creating a "bag of words" model. Let's try it on two documents (below); each document is an example of jazz "scatting", when a vocalist improvises with nonsense syllables.

- *Document a*: "doo be doo be doo"
- *Document b*: "doo doo be doo be"

The bag-of-words summary for *Document a* looks like this: `"be": 2, "doo": 3`

@lesson-point{
A bag-of-words model represents text as an unordered collection of words with frequencies.
}

@slidebreak

As you can see, we've taken the original sentence and disregarded word order, creating a collection that focuses solely on *word frequency*.

@QandA{
@Q{What is the bag-of-words summary for *Document b*?}
@A{The bag-of-words summary for Document b looks like this: `"be": 2, "doo": 3`.}
@A{It should be identical to the bag-of-words summary for Document a.}
@Q{How did you know what order to put the words in?}
@A{I used the same order as the bag-of-words summary for Document a.}
}

_Note: We could have written these bag-of-words summaries as `"doo": 3, "be": 2`, but once we decide on a word order for one document, adhering to that same order is required. The simplest way to be consistent is to use alphabetical order._

The bag-of-words summary for both documents is exactly the same!

@slidebreak

A plagiarism detector that uses this model, taking stock of word frequency and ignoring literally everything else, would discover that the two bags of words are a perfect match.


@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{plagiarism}.
- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{slightly-less-primitive-detector.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{

@Q{How is the `bag-equality` plagiarism detector different from our primitive `simple-equality` plagiarism detector?}
@A{The `bag-equality` plagiarism detector compares two bag-of-words summaries, rather than simply comparing two texts.}


@Q{How is the `bag-equality` plagiarism detector similar to our primitive `simple-equality` plagiarism detector?}
@A{Like our primitive plagiarism detector, it checks for identicality. It determines if the two bags of words are identical or not.}
}

Checking if two bags of words are identical *is* an improvement from checking if two texts are identical.

@teacher{If your students are ready to think about vectors, you can continue on to @lesson-link{ai-training-2} to learn about a major upgrade to our plagiarism detection algorithm.}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{What similarities are there between a system that recommends songs and `bag-equality` plagiarism detection?}
@A{Both systems build summaries of the available data and then work with those summaries.}
