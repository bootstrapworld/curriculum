You have pictures of 20 skulls that were found in a cave and the measurements of their circumferences.

*Part 1: Collecting Data in Google Sheets*

@n Make a copy of the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw0m4K2jMQAvAE0gb2f93_7HB52KgnxjluuCmVpamOE/edit?usp=sharing, Skull Data table} for you and your partner to work with.

@n Work together to fill out the first two columns, by recording the _Skull Number_ and _Circumference (in inches)_ for each image you have.

*Part 2: Sorting Data in Google Sheets*

It would be helpful to order our data so that the skulls were ordered from smallest to largest.

@n Which column letter includes the size of the skull? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{B}}

[cols="1a, 1a, 1a"]
|===
| @n Click on *B*.

The column should turn blue.

Hover your mouse over the column.

A little downward pointing triangle (arrow) will appear at the top right.

@vspace{1ex}

Click on the arrow.

A drop down menu will appear.

Select "Sort A -> Z" to organize the numbers from smallest to largest.

@n What do you think would have happened if you had selected “Sort Z → A” instead?

@span{.blankline}{@ifsoln{It would have sorted the column from greatest to smallest.}}

*Part 3: Determining Age Group and Sex from Data*:

[cols="3,2,2,2", options="header""]

|Child:
|Adult Female:
|Adult Male:

| Typical Skull circumference range
| 14 - 21 inches
| 21 - 23 inches
| 22 - 24 inches

@n What will you do if you're unsure about whether a skull is from a child or an adult, because it's right on the border between them?

** Option 1: 	Delete any data values for which you’re unsure about sex or age.
** Option 2: 	Flip a coin if you’re unsure about sex; call it male if it comes up heads and female if it comes up tails. Likewise, call it a child for heads and an adult for tails.
** Option 3: 	Classify sex or age as “Unsure” if you’re unsure about it.

_Explain why the third of the following options would be the best way to handle this problem:_

@n Use the Skull Circumference Range information to complete the columns for _Age Group_ and _Sex_.

@n Based on this very small sample, who would you predictdo you think got sacrificed in Maya rituals? Males or females? Old or young?
