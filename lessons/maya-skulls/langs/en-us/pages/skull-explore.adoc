= Skull Exploring and Data Collection

You have pictures of 20 skulls that were found in a cave.

Skull circumferences (in inches) of various groups typically fall in these ranges:

Collecting and Sorting Data into Google Sheets

. Make a copy of the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw0m4K2jMQAvAE0gb2f93_7HB52KgnxjluuCmVpamOE/edit?usp=sharing, Skull Data table}.  
. Input the title of each column of your data in Row 1 of your Google Sheet. See below for column titles to include in your data table.
. Work with your partner to input the # of the skull and the skull circumference. You are just filling out Column A and Column B.
. “Sort” your data from smallest by clicking Row 1 so that the entire row is highlighted. Then go to “Data” → “Create a filter”. You should see a downward arrow in the first row of your data table.
. “Sort” your Skull Circumference from smallest to largest by clicking on the down arrow of Column B and selecting “Sort A → Z”. This will organize numbers from smallest to largest.

*Determining Age Group and Sex*:
Now that you have sorted your skull circumference data, you will use the Skull Circumference Range information given at the top of this page to enter data for “Age Group” and “Sex”.

What will you do if you're unsure about whether a skull is from a child or an adult, because it's right on the border between them?

** Option 1: 	Delete any data values for which you’re unsure about sex or age.
** Option 2: 	Flip a coin if you’re unsure about sex; call it male if it comes up heads and female if it comes up tails. Likewise, call it a child for heads and an adult for tails.
** Option 3: 	Classify sex or age as “Unsure” if you’re unsure about it.
