You'll need to open the @starter-file{expanded-animals}, and save a copy to complete this worksheet.

@n Evaluate the `more-animals` table in the Interactions Area. This is the _complete_ population of animals from the shelter! Below is a true statement about that population:

[.lesson-point]
The population is 47.7% fixed and 52.3% unfixed.

*Type each of the following lines into the Interactions Area and hit â€œEnter".*
----
random-rows(more-animals, 10)
random-rows(more-animals, 40)

@n What do you get?
@fitb{}{}

@n What is the contract for `random-rows`?
@fitb{}{}


@n What does the `random-rows` function do?

@fitb{}{}

@n In the Definitions Area, define `small-sample` and `large-sample` to be `random-rows(more-animals, 10)` and `random-rows(more-animals, 40)`, respectively.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing percentages of fixed and unfixed.

- The percentage of fixed animals in the entire population is @fitb{}{*47.7%*}
- The percentage of fixed animals in `small-sample` is @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of fixed animals in `large-sample` is @fitb{}{}

@n Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is @fitb{}{*roughly 5%*}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `large-sample` is @fitb{}{}

@n Click "Run" to direct the computer to generate a different set of random samples of these sizes. Make a new `pie-chart` for each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is @fitb{}{*roughly 5%*}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `large-sample` is @fitb{}{}

@n Which sample size gave us a more accurate inference about the whole population? Why?
