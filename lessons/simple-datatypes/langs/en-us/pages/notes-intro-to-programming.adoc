= Introduction to Programming

== Data Types
Programming languages involve different @vocab{data types}, such as Numbers, Strings, Booleans, and even Images.

	- Numbers are values like `1`, `0.4`, `1/3`, and `-8261.003`.

	** Numbers are _usually_  used for quantitative data and other values are _usually_  used as categorical data.

@ifproglang{pyret}{** In Pyret, any decimal _must_  start with a 0. For example, `0.22` is valid, but `.22` is not.}

	- Strings are values like `"Emma"`, `"Rosanna"`, `"Jen and Ed"`, or even `"08/28/1980"`.

	** All strings _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks.

	- Booleans are either `true` or `false`.

== Operators

@ifproglang{pyret}{

Operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `<`, etc.) work the same way in Pyret that they do in math.

	- Operators are written between values, for example: `4 + 2`.

	- In Pyret, operators must always have a space around them. `4 + 2` is valid, but `4+2` is not.

	- If an expression has different operators, parentheses must be used to show order of operations. `4 + 2 + 6` and `4 + (2 * 6)` are valid, but `4 + 2 * 6` is not.
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{

*Operators* (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `<`, etc.) are treated the same way as functions: after all, they have inputs and outputs and obey the same rules!

}

== Applying Functions

Applying functions @ifproglang{wescheme}{(and operators!)} works much the way it does in math. Every function has a name, takes some inputs, and produces some output. The function name is written first, followed by a list of @vocab{arguments} @ifproglang{pyret}{in parentheses}.

	- In math this could look like @math{f(5)} or @math{g(10, 4)}.
	- In @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret} @ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme}, these examples would be written as @show{(sexp->code `(f 5))} and @show{(sexp->code `(g 10 4))}.
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
	- Appling the operator @math{+} to the inputs 1 and 2 would look like @show{(sexp->code '(+ 1 2))}.
}
	- Applying a function to make images would look like @show{(sexp->code `(star 50, "solid", "red"))}.
	- There are many other functions, for example @show{(sexp->code 'num-sqr)}, @show{(sexp->code 'num-sqrt)}, @show{(sexp->code 'triangle)}, @show{(sexp->code 'square)}, @show{(sexp->code 'string-repeat)}, etc.

@vspace{1ex}

Functions have @vocab{contracts}, which help explain how a function should be used. Every contract has three parts:

	- The _Name_ of the function - literally, what it's called.
	- The _Domain_ of the function - what  _types of values_ the function consumes, and in what order.
	- The _Range_ of the function - what  _type of value_ the function produces.
