This project is *not* about getting correct solutions the first time! Rather, the focus is on detecting the source of our errors.

| Circles of Evaluation
| Even if my Circles do not produce the correct result, they show my very best attempt to represent the expressions. Every expression includes exactly one nested Circle. Every function has two inputs.
| Even if my Circles do not produce the correct result, they show a solid attempt to represent the expressions. I put a function at the top of each Circle. Sometimes I've forgotten to include a nested Circle.
| Even if my Circles do not produce the correct result, they are hard for the reader to interpret. Sometimes I forget to put the function at the top of the Circle, and sometimes I forget to include a nested Circle.


| Pyret Code
| Even if it does not produce the correct result, I have included parentheses and commas where needed. My code will not produce any error messages.
| My code is sometimes syntactically correct. My code will sometimes produce an error message.
| My code is rarely syntactically correct. My code will often produce error messages.

| Identifying and Recording Mistakes
| Whenever my original Circle of Evaluation or code was incorrect, I was able to identify the mistake and fix it.
| When my Circle of Evaluation or code was incorrect, I was sometimes able to identify the mistake and fix it.
| When my Circle of Evaluation or code was incorrect, I rarely or never was able to identify the mistake fix it.
