== The Identity Property

=== Overview

Students determine if pairs of Circles of Evaluation represent equivalent expressions. The Circles of Evaluation make visible the structural changes that occur when we apply the @vocab{Identity Property}.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

@teacher{
Build on prior knowledge by reminding students of the category names they created in @lesson-link{equivalence}, and draw their attention to any category names that connect to the Identity Property. For example, a category like “multiplying by one” or "adding zero" is a strong hint that students have an intuition for the @vocab{Identity Property}!)
}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete @printable-exercise{discover-identity.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

@QandA{
@Q{What did you Notice about the three Circles of Evaluation in Question 1? What do you Wonder?}
@A{Possible responses: All three Circles include @math{12 + 4}. All three Circles evaluate to @math{16}.}
@Q{What did you observe about the Identity Property for division? Subtraction?}
@A{Possible responses: I can multiply or divide by @math{1} and get an equivalent result. I can add or subtract @math{0} and get an equivalent result. I need to remember that Commutativity does not apply for division and subtraction!}
}

@lesson-point{
Multiplying or dividing an expression by 1 does not change its value; similarly, adding or subtracting 0 results in the original value.
}

@teacher{Confirm that students understand the main idea about the Identity Property! They will apply this knowledge throughout the lesson.}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

Sometimes, we will encounter the Identity Property in sneakier forms!

@show{(coe '(+ 27 (- 8 8)))}

@QandA{
How does the Circle of Evaluation above illustrate the Identity Property?

@A{In the Circle, _zero_ (or @math{8 - 8}) is being added to @math{27}!}
}


@slidebreak{InvestigateC}

Now, consider this equation, which is really a pair of equivalent fractions:

@center{@big{@math{\frac{3}{4} = \frac{15}{20}}}}


When we find equivalent fractions, we _multiply by one_! In the example above, @math{\frac{3}{4}} was multiplied by @math{\frac{5}{5}} to get @math{\frac{15}{20}}.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{identity-prop-table.adoc}, filling in the blanks so that all of the Circles of Evaluation are equivalent.
- Then, complete @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong.adoc}. Be sure to explain why each Circle of Evaluation you select does not belong with the others!
}

@teacher{
As students explain why various Circles of Evaluation do not belong with the others, encourage them to practice using vocabulary that they have encountered already.
}

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

- For which operations does the Identity Property hold? Why?
- Did you encounter any instances where the Identity Property was used in combination with another property?


== The Identity Property and Variables

=== Overview
Students use their knowledge of the Identity Property to determine if @vocab{expressions} with variables are equivalent or not.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

We can represent the Identity Property with @vocab{variables}, in the same way that we could represent the @vocab{Associative Property} and the @vocab{Commutative Property} with variables. Here's an example:

[.embedded, cols=">.^3,^.^1,<.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe  '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe  '(* (+ 3 q) 1))}
| @show{(math '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(math '(* (+ 3 q) 1))}
|===


@slidebreak{Launch}

Or like this:

[.embedded, cols=">.^3,^.^1,<.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe  '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe  '(+ 0 (+ 3 q)))}
| @show{(math '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(math '(+ 0 (+ 3 q)))}
|===


The Identity Property will hold no matter what values we substitute in for @math{q} or for @math{t}. Although computation can help us test equivalence, there's no way to test every possible value. The Identity Property lets us prove that these expressions are equivalent _even with variables_.

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

@teacher{
As they did with the Commutative Property and the Associative Property, students now make the transition from numeric values to variables.

If students would like, they may choose values to represent the variables. Early finishers can substitute in numbers of their choosing to confirm that their analyses of the Circles of Evaluation are correct.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false-variables.adoc} using your knowledge of the Identity Property to determine if the equation represented by the Circles of Evaluation is true or false.
- Decide @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong-variables.adoc}. Be sure to explain your thinking.
- @opt{Try @opt-printable-exercise{true-or-false-variables-challenge.adoc}. Here, you will again decide if the equation represented by the Circles of Evaluation is true or false -- but you will see more nested Circles...and you will need to apply your knowledge of the Associative Property and the Commutative Property as well!}
}

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

- Did you use Computation to check your work? Or do you prefer thinking about properties and equivalence?
- There is a version of the Identity Property for each of the four basic operations -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. But the Commutative and Associative Properties _only apply for addition and multiplication_. Why is the Identity Property different from these other properties?


== Programming Exploration: Identity Property

=== Overview

Students explore @proglang functions that take in an image and produce an image identical to the original.


=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

You’ve discovered that multiplying or dividing an expression by 1 does not change its value. Similarly, adding or subtracting 0 results in the original value. Each of these four applications of the Identity Property is represented in the four Circles of Evaluation below.

[.embedded, cols="^.^6a,^.^6a,^.^6a,^.^6a",stripes="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(* m 1))}
| @show{(coe '(/ m 1))}
| @show{(coe '(+ m 0))}
| @show{(coe '(- m 0))}
|===

Each of these four Circles evaluates to @math{m} which means *the Identity Property requires an operation that does… nothing!*

@slidebreak{Launch}

We can also represent these four applications of the Identity Property with the Circles of Evaluation below, with some made-up functions that take in just ONE input. The functions' describe what they do!

@teacher{If students struggle with this idea, revisiting the idea of a "function machine" can be helpful!}

[.embedded, cols="^.^6a,^.^6a,^.^6a,^.^6a",stripes="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(multiply-by-one m))}
| @show{(coe '(divide-by-one m))}
| @show{(coe '(add-zero m))}
| @show{(coe '(subtract-zero m))}
|===


No matter what value we use for @math{m}, we will get that value back.

@slidebreak{Launch-RP}


@teacher{
Select four students -- one to _act out_ each of the four functions above (`multiply-by-one`, `divide-by-one`, `add-zero`, and `subtract-zero`). Make it clear to the class what each function's name is. Emphasize that each function expects a Number, and will produce Number.
}

@lesson-roleplay{
Just as with any acting career, this one will begin with a rehearsal. When I say, "*multiply-by-one 24*", you say, "*24*" Let's try it.

- Teacher: *multiply-by-one... 24*
- Student: 24!
- Teacher: *divide-by-one... 366*
- Student: _366_
- Teacher: *add-zero... 4*
- Student: _4_
- Teacher: *subtract-zero... 16*
- Student: _16_

That was a great rehearsal. You're ready for the stage! Now it's the class' turn to give you cues! Who's got an input for our one of our actors?
}

@teacher{
Go around the room soliciting expressions from students until it's clear that everyone could run this script in their sleep.

Thank the fantastic actors who brilliantly played the roles of `multiply-by-one`, `divide-by-one`, `add-zero`, and `subtract-zero`!
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

@lesson-instruction{
Let's make a list of *other* function names that follow the Identity Property. In other words, if we give the actor playing that function _any_ number, the function will return that same number.
}

@teacher{
If students struggle, you can offer some suggestions to get them started. For instance, @math{a + (8 - 8)} or @math{(24 - 23) /times h}.
}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

We just talked about four different functions. Each one consumed a number and produced a number. But what about functions that consume images? Can the Identity Property apply to those?

@QandA{
@Q{@right{@image{images/dog.png, 125}}What functions do you know that will transform this image of a dog?}
@A{Sample responses: `scale`, `rotate`, `overlay`, etc...}
@Q{What is something we can do to this dog (right) that will _transform_ it... but still result in the *exact same image*?}
}

@teacher{
Solicit student responses and record them on the board. If students do not volunteer answers, consider sharing one or two of the following possible responses: flip it vertically twice; flip it horizontally twice; rotate it 360 degrees clockwise; rotate it 360 counter-clockwise; scale it by 1; slide it some distance and then return it to its original position.

Students will be working in @proglang soon -- but we recommend keeping things unplugged for now! You might even print up an image of the dog -- or any other image you choose -- to display on the board at the front of the room. Invite students to the board to demonstrate their ideas by manipulating it.}

@slidebreak{Investigate-DN}


@lesson-instruction{
- Open @starter-file{expressions-equations} and click “Run.”
- Type `dog` into the Interactions Area to see what the defined image looks like.
- How many different ways you can transform dog and still get the same image back!
- Spend a few minutes to see how many “do-nothing” transformations you can make.
- Up for a challenge? Try applying multiple “do-nothing” functions to the `dog` image.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
@Q{What “do-nothing” transformations did you come up with? Let’s share.}
}

@teacher{As students share, record their responses on the board by drawing the Circles of Evaluation that represent their ideas. Some possible responses are below.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{scale-rotate-identity.adoc}, where you will explore `scale`, `rotate`, `flip-vertical`, and `flip-horizontal` further.
- As you work through this activity, be sure to make predictions about the code before testing it out!
}


=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

- What did you discover? For what values did `scale` and `rotate` produce identical images of the dog?
- In your own words, describe how functions in @proglang helped you understand the Identity Property.
