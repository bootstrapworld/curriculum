Is the equation represented by the two Circles of Evaluation true or false? Explain your response. Do you notice any other mathematical properties at play? If so, explain.

True or False? Explain


| @n
| @show{(coe '(/ (+ 0 (* m 1)) 1 ))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(* m (- 4 3)))}
| @ifsoln{True. In each Circle of Evaluation, the Identity Property is correctly applied to m.}


| @n
| @show{(coe '(* (+ g h) (/ 30 30)))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(* (+ h g) (/ 523 523)))}
| @ifsoln{True. The Commutative Property allows us to change the order in which we add g and h. In both Circles of Evaluation, the sum of g and h is multiplied by 1.}


| @n
| @show{(coe '(+ (* h (* t q)) 0))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(+ 0 (* q (* t h))))}
| @ifsoln{True. In both Circles of Evaluation, zero is being added to the product of h, t, and q. The Associative Property allows us adjust the grouping of h, t, and q.}



| @n
| @show{(coe '(+ (- f h) (- t t)))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(+ (- h f) (- k k)))}
| @ifsoln{False. Although zero is being added in both Circles of Evaluation, the Commutative Property does not hold for subtraction. If we changed subtraction to addition (so f + h = h + f), this would be true.}


| @n
| @show{(coe '(+ (+ g g) (- m m)))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(+ (* 2 g) (- 4.6 4.6)))}
| @ifsoln{True. The Identity Property is being applied. Both Circles of Evaluation are equal to g + g.}



| @n
| @show{(coe '(- 7.2 (- (* 5 k) (* 5 k))))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(- 7.2 (- (/ w 3) (/ 3 w))))}
| @ifsoln{False. Although the first Circle of Evaluation shows zero being subtracted from 7.2, we do not know what value is being subtracted from 7.2 in the second Circle of Evaluation.}
