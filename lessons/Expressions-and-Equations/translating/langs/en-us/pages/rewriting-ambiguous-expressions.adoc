All of the verbal expressions below are ambiguous. Rewrite each expression two times:

- The first time, write the expression to indicate that either multiplication or division happens first.
- The second time, write the expression to indicate that either addition or subtraction happens first.

Use parentheses to indicate which operation comes first. Give both the arithmetic and verbal expression. We've done the first one for you.
