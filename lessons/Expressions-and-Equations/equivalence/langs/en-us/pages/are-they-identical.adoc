Are the images produced by the two lines of code identical -- or will they look different? With your partner, make a prediction, referring to your contracts as needed. Test the code in @starter-file{editor}. Explain your response. We've partially completed the first one for you.

| @n
| @show{(code '(square 100 "solid" "red"))}
  @show{(code '(square (* 50 50) "solid" "red"))}
|
| No
| The shapes are not equivalent because 50 * 50 is not equal to 100.


| @n
| @show{(code '(square 40 "solid" "deeppink"))}
  @show{(code '(rectangle 40 40 "solid" "deeppink"))}
|
| @ifsoln{Yes}
| @ifsoln{The shapes produced will be equivalent. A rectangle with four 40-pixel sides is identical to a square with 40-pixel sides.}

| @n
| @show{(code '(radial-star 6 20 50 "solid" "red"))}
  @show{(code '(radial-star 20 6 50 "solid" "red"))}
|
| @ifsoln{No}
| @ifsoln{The shapes produced will be different. The three Number arguments each represent different elements and cannot be reordered.}

| @n
| @show{(code '(radial-star 6 20 50 "solid" "red"))}
  @show{(code '(radial-star (+ 3 3) (* 4 5) 50 "solid" "red"))}
|
| @ifsoln{Yes}
| @ifsoln{The shapes produced will be equivalent because @math{3+3 = 6} and @math{4*5 = 20}.}


| @n
| @show{(code '(circle 60 "outline" "tomato"))}
  @show{(code '(ellipse 60 60 "outline" "tomato"))}
|
| @ifsoln{No}
| @ifsoln{The circle's radius is 60, whereas the ellipse's length and width are 60.}


| @n
| @show{(code '(star 75 "outline" "pink"))}
  @show{(code '(star 75 "pink" "outline"))}
|
| @ifsoln{No}
| @ifsoln{The second line of code produces an error message, not an image.}

| @n
| @show{(code '(circle 60 "solid" "lime"))}
  @show{(code '(ellipse 120 120 "solid" "lime"))}
|
| @ifsoln{Yes}
| @ifsoln{The shapes will be equivalent. A circle with a radius of 60 has a diameter of 120, just like the ellipse.}
