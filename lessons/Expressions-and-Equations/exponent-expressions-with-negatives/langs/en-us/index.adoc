== Exponential Expressions with Negatives

@objective{expressions-negative-exponents}

=== Overview

Students use Circles of Evaluation to visualize expressions with @vocab{exponents} and negatives.

=== Launch

@QandA{

@Q{What do you Notice about the two Circles of Evaluation below? What do you Wonder?}

| @math{-(3^2)}
| @math{(-3)^2}
| @show{(coe  '(negate (expt 3 2)))}
| @show{(coe  '(expt (negate 3) 2))}

@A{Possible Noticings: One expression is negative, the other is positive. Both expressions have one Circle inside another Circle.}
@A{Possible Wonderings: Will I always get a negative outcome if there are no parentheses? Will I always get a positive outcome if there are parentheses?}
@Q{@math{-3^2} has the *same* Circle of Evaluation as one of the expressions, above. Which expression do you think is equivalent to @math{-3^2}?}
@A{Student responses will vary. The Circle of Evaluation on the left is equivalent. In an expression like the one above, we apply the exponent before we negate. Negating can be viewed as multiplying by @math{-1}. Exponentiation precedes multiplication.}
}


@strategy{Is Negation Part of the Order of Operations?!}{
"Negation" is not a part of the PEMDAS acronym that we so commonly associate with the Order of Operations. Negating, however, can be viewed as multiplying by one. That means that when a student claims that @math{-3^2=9}, the error is in fact attributable to Order or Operations! The student has applied the multiplied and _then_ applied the exponent; that's the wrong order!

In @citation{glidden-2008, "a study conducted by Glidden (2008)"}, five multiple choice problems were presented to a group of 381 prospective teachers. The teachers self-reported that they were relatively able mathematically and confident in their ability. Interestingly, 78.5% of subjects used the incorrect order of operations to compute @math{-3^2}. This was a stark contrast to the other problems (@math{ 2 \times 3 + 5; 3 + 4 \times 2; 9 - 4 + 3; 24 \div 2 \times 3}), where most prospective teachers were able to arrive at the correct solution.

The takeaway? We urge you to spend lots of time drawing and discussing the Circles of Evaluation in this lesson. Misconceptions run rampant when it comes to exponentiation on a negative base.

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

Today, we are going to apply exponents in two different contexts:

- Sometimes, we apply an exponent to a _negative value_.
- Sometimes, we apply an exponent... and _then_ we negate the outcome.

Circles of Evaluation will help us visualize the difference between these two scenarios.

@lesson-instruction{
- On @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}, draw two Circles of Evaluation to represent each equation. Then, use your Circles of Evaluation to determine if the equation is true or false. The first one is done for you.
- When you're finished, look over your work to see what patterns you notice and then respond to the questions at the bottom of the page.

@QandA{
@Q{An exponent expression has a negative base _inside_ parentheses. Which do we apply first: `expt` or `negate`?}
@A{First, we apply `negate`, then `expt`.}
@Q{An exponent expression has a negative base and no grouping symbols. Which do we apply first: `expt` or `negate`?}
@A{First, we apply `expt`, then `negate`.}
@Q{Why were _some_ of the equations on the page true, but not all of them?}
@A{Possible response: Exponent expressions with negatives but no grouping symbols were always negative, because the negation came last. Exponent expressions with grouping symbols were sometimes negative and sometimes positive, depending on how many times we multiplied the base by itself.}

== Variable Exponential Expressions with Negatives

@objective{expressions-negative-exponents-variables}

=== Overview

Students extend their knowledge of Circles of Evaluation to evaluate expressions with @vocab{variables}, exponents, and negatives.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

Invite students to consider the role of variables in expressions with negatives and exponents by facilitating a discussion using the prompts below.

@QandA{
@Q{Is @math{-m} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.}
@A{If the value of @math{m} is negative, then @math{-m} is positive. If the value of @math{m} is positive, then @math{-m} is negative. So, @math{-m} can be positive, negative, or zero.}
@Q{Is @math{-m^2} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.}
@A{First we apply the exponent, then we negate. The outcome is always negative (unless @math{m} is zero).}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you Notice and what do you Wonder about the three Circles of Evaluation below?}

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1,^.^1", grid="none",stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(expt x 2))}
|@show{(coe '(negate (expt x 2)))}
|@show{(coe '(expt (negate x) 2))}
|===

@A{Possible responses: They all include @math{x} and @math{2}. Two of the three Circles of Evaluation include nested Circles. The functions used are `expt` and `negate`. I wonder if they are equivalent or not.}

@Q{Write an algebraic expression to correspond with each Circle of Evaluation.}
@A{Circle 1: @math{x^2}}
@A{Circle 2: @math{-x^2}}
@A{Circle 3: @math{(-x)^2}}
@A{Debrief with students to confirm that they can represent exponent expressions with Circles of Evaluation before moving on to the next activity, where students will apply this understanding.}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
- On @printable-exercise{evaluate-twice.adoc}, create a Circle of Evaluation for each expression provided. Once you have drawn a Circle of Evaluation, use it to help you evaluate the expression _twice_ -- once for @math{x=5} and once for @math{x=âˆ’5}.
- When did the expressions produce the same outcome for both @math{x=5} and @math{x=-5}?
  * The expressions produced the same outcome for 1 and 2, the expressions that involved squaring rather than cubing._
- When you're done, turn to @printable-exercise{exponents-variables-table.adoc}. Draw a Circle of Evaluation to represent the expression, then evaluate using the assigned value.

Was it more challenging to work with _algebraic_ exponent expressions (with variables) than it was to work with numeric exponent expressions? Why or why not?
