== Predict

@vspace{1ex}

Which equations in the table below will be _true_ when @math{m=6}? What about when @math{m=12}? @math{m=o}? With your partner, put a check ✓ in the boxes when you predict the equations will be true. Note: an equation might be true for some values and false for others!

== Test

@n Open the @starter-file{negation-2} and click "Run". @ifproglang{pyret}{Select "Show Details" to the right of `examples-block-1`.} Using the information provided, fill in as many of the blanks as needed below to describe the examples that failed.

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{1}} failed because the left side was @fitb{2ex}{@ifsoln{-6}} and the right side was @fitb{2ex}{@ifsoln{6}}.

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{3}} failed because the left side was @fitb{2ex}{@ifsoln{-6}} and the right side was @fitb{2ex}{@ifsoln{6}}.

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{5}} failed because the left side was @fitb{2ex}{@ifsoln{6}} and the right side was @fitb{2ex}{@ifsoln{-6}}.


@n Talia says that setting `m` equal to _any_ positive value will produce the same results. In other words, she thinks that the *same tests* will fail if `m > 0`? Do you agree? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. All positive values will produce the same result.}}

@n Edit the definition of `m` (Section 1 in the starter file) to try out some other *positive* values. Was your prediction correct? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Change the definition of `m` so that it equals -12. Click "Run". Which tests failed? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Tests 2, 4, and 5 failed.}}

@n Edit the definition of `m` to test out other *negative* values. What do you observe? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Change the definition of `m` so that it equals 0. Click "Run". Which tests failed? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{None of them!}}

== Reflect

@n Which equations in the @proglang file are always *true*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{None of them!}}

@n Which equations in the @proglang file are always *false*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The last one!}}
