@n _Example._ How many different ways can you group the following expression: @math{8 + 2 + 9 + 1} ? Below are three possibilities. For each example, order stays the same, but groupings change. Can you think of any more?

[cols="^.^8a,^.^8a,^.^8a,^.^8a", stripes="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(+ (+ 8 (+ 2 9 )) 1 ))}
| @show{(coe '(+ (+ 8 2) (+ 9 1)))}
| @show{(coe '(+ (+ (+ 8 2) 9) 1))}
| @showsoln{(coe '(+ 8 (+ 2 (+ 9 1))))}

@n Your turn! Draw as many equivalent Circles of Evaluation as you can in the boxes below for the expression @math{98 + 3 + 7 + 26 + 4}. Then, answer the questions at the bottom of the page. For each equivalent expression, *change the groupings but not the order*. To get you going, we've completed one sample Circle of Evaluation and started a second one.


[.FillVerticalSpace,cols="^.^8a,^.^8a", stripes="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(+ (+ (+ (+ 98 3) 7) 26) 4))}
| @show{(coe '(+ (+ (?ANS 98) (?ANS 3)) (+ (+ (?ANS 7) (?ANS 26)) (?ANS 4))))}

| @showsoln{(coe '(+ (+ (+ (?ANS 98) (?ANS 3))(+ (?ANS 7)(?ANS 26))) (?ANS 4)))}
| @showsoln{(coe '(+ (?ANS 98) (+ (+ (?ANS 3) (?ANS 7)) (+ (?ANS 26) (?ANS 4)))))}

| @showsoln{(coe '(+ (?ANS 98) (+ (?ANS 3) (+ (?ANS 7) (+ (?ANS 26) (?ANS 4))))))}
| @showsoln{(coe '(+ (+ (?ANS 98) (?ANS 3)) (+ (?ANS 7)(+ (?ANS 26) (?ANS 4)))))}

@n Which Circle (above) seems like it would be the _most difficult_ to solve in your head? *Put a star by that one.* (You may award more than one star if it feels right.) Then, in the space below, explain what makes that Circle challenging to evaluate. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. Students should}}
