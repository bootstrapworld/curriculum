| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* The Associative Property - like other laws of arithmetic - is more meaningful and memorable when students view it as a powerful tool to help them to do math efficiently.
* Students may need support in parsing expressions that include both an operation that _does_ support Associativity alongside an operation where Associativity does _not_ apply.

== The Associative Property

=== Overview

Students explore Circles of Evaluation to discover that no matter how we group numbers being either added or multiplied, the end result will always be the same.

=== Launch

We've already learned about the @vocab{Commutative Property}, which tells us that, for any expression involving only addition or only multiplication, changing the order of the numbers will not change the end result. But what about changing the _groupings_?

@lesson-instruction{
Look at the first problem on @printable-exercise{discover-assoc.adoc}.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you Notice about the three Circles of Evaluation? How about the two expressions that accompany them? What do you Wonder?}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Work through the remaining problems with your partner. Be sure to evaluate the Circles to see if they produce equivalent outcomes.
- When you're finished, move on to @printable-exercise{discover-assoc-cont.adoc}.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What did you observe about the Commutative Property?}
}

@slidebreak

When adding three numbers, we can start by adding the first pair of numbers _or_ the last pair of numbers. Similarly, when multiplying three numbers, we can start by multiplying the first pair of numbers _or_ the last pair of numbers.

The Associative Property holds for addition and multiplication, but not division or subtraction.


@teacher{Students apply this understanding in the subsequent activities.}

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- On @printable-exercise{assoc-prop-table.adoc}, apply the @vocab{Associative Property} to create @vocab{equivalent} Circles of Evaluation. Pay attention to the operators!
- Now try @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}. Determine if each equation is true, and be sure to explain your response.
}

@teacher{
Note: In these activities, students will need to broaden their definition of the Associative Property, as they will encounter expressions with more than three numeric values. The same general rules still apply: When we change the groupings of numbers being added or multiplied, we get the same outcome.

Follow up with students, paying specific attention to expressions with multiple operations. In these instances, students sometimes _can_ apply the Associative Property - but only on the parts of the expression that feature only addition or only multiplication.
}

=== Synthesize

- Can you ever apply the Associative Property on an expression that includes division or subtraction? Explain.
- When applying the Associative Property, did you ever change the order of the numbers? Why or why not?
- When applying the Associative Property, did you ever change the architecture of the circles? (For instance, did you ever change “three nested circles” to “two-circles-in-a-circle”?) When was that necessary? Why?

== The Associative Property and Mental Math

=== Overview
Students explore how the Associative Property and Circles of Evaluation can make mental computation simpler.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{so-many-groupings.adoc}.
- First, study the example. Notice how the groupings change but the order stays the same. Can you think of a fourth way to re-group the expression?
- Now it's your turn! You will explore different ways to group this expression: @math{98 + 3 + 7 + 26 + 4}
- Draw as many equivalent circles of evaluation as you can in the boxes below, then answer the questions at the bottom of the page. You may change the groupings, but not the order!
}

@teacher{
Allow students to work, encouraging them to try different groupings and _structures_, all of which will produce the same outcome! If possible, invite students to draw their Circles of Evaluation on the board so that the class can see all possible configurations. After students have drawn their Circles of Evaluation and had some time to consider the reflection questions, follow up with a class discussion.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{Which Circle of Evaluation seemed like it would be the most difficult to solve in your head? Why?}
@Q{Which Circle of Evaluation seemed like it would be the easiest to solve in your head? Why?}
}


=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{which-grouping-makes-the-comp-easier.adoc}. Examine each Circle of Evaluation and put a check mark by the one that results in a simpler computation. Then, evaluate the expression.
- Now, try @printable-exercise{associativity-makes-comp-easier.adoc} to apply the Associative Property to expressions with more numbers and varying operators.
}

=== Synthesize

- How can the Associative Property help you do mental math more efficiently?
- Did Circles help you to visualize associativity? Why or why not?

== Applying the Commutative and Associative Properties

=== Launch

When multiplying @math{2 \times 17 \times 5}, you'll arrive at a result much more efficiently if you notice that @math{2 \times 5 = 10}.

Rewriting @math{2 \times 17 \times 5} as @math{2 \times 5 \times 17} is an example of applying _two_ properties in one go: reordering the numbers makes way for more helpful groupings. It's easier to multiply @math{10} by @math{17} than it is to multiply @math{34} by @math{5}.

@slidebreak

The freedom to solve in a variety of ways rather than just moving left to right opens up a world of possibility. In the short term, we can compute efficiently. In the long term, confidence using laws of arithmetic provides a strong foundation for more complex algebraic reasoning.

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{restructuring-addition-expressions.adoc}, where you will reorder and regroup a given addition expression using a Circle of Evaluation.
- Now, complete @printable-exercise{restructuring-multiplication-expressions.adoc}, where you will reorder and regroup a multiplication expression using a Circle of Evaluation.
- @opt{Ready for a challenge? Try @opt-printable-exercise{associativity-makes-comp-easier-challenge.adoc} to apply the evaluate expressions with fractions and decimals.}
}

@QandA{
@Q{What was your strategy for restructuring the expressions to make them simpler to evaluate?}
}

@slidebreak

@teacher{With some familiarity of regrouping and reordering, students are ready to get creative and develop their own arithmetic expressions.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Think of an addition or multiplication problem that _appears_ to be very challenging, but is _much_ easier to solve after applying the Associative Property _and_ the Commutative Property. Write it down on a piece of paper. Be creative!
- Trade papers with a partner. How do your problems compare?
- Represent your partner's expression with a Circle of Evaluation that makes solving simpler.
- Turn your paper in to your teacher.
}

@teacher{We encourage you to review students' submissions, and write a few on the board to discuss as a class. We want to sharpen students' eyes and help them develop the ability to spot instances when they might apply the Associative Property in any context.}

=== Synthesize

- How would you describe the relationship between the Associative Property and the Commutative Property? Do you think one is more powerful than the other?
- How are the Commutative and Associative Properties similar? How are they different?

== Programming Exploration: Associativity

=== Overview

Students consider whether various functions that we use when coding are associative.

=== Launch

In math, the Associative Property tells us that when adding or multiplying three or more numbers, it doesn't matter which way you group them. In other words, we can change the groupings and get the same result!

@QandA{
- Can you predict which functions in @proglang are associative and which ones are not?
- Multiplication and addition are both commutative _and_ associative. Do you think @proglang functions that are associative are _also_ commutative?
}

@teacher{Pose the above open-ended questions and invite students to discuss with a partner. Invite some students to share their thinking with the class.}

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{associativity-and-code.adoc} and open the @starter-file{comm-and-assoc}.
- With your partner, make a prediction about whether each function is associative.
- Complete any Circles of Evaluation and code, then test the code to determine if the images produced are identical or not.
}

@teacher{As students work, encourage them to _always_ make predictions before testing the code. Similarly, the activity will be more valuable if students discuss _why_ the code did or did not produce identical images. Debrief to ensure comprehension.

When everyone is finished, check in with students. Did everyone discover that _all_ of the functions were associative? There is a good chance your students will wonder if _all_ @proglang functions are associative!
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{On @printable-exercise{associativity-and-code.adoc}, we discovered that `overlay`, `beside`, and `above` were all associative, but `blend-images` was not. Can you think of any other @proglang functions that are _not_ associative?}
@A{Answers may vary: @show{(code 'string-contains)} is not associative. Other functions, such as `triangle`, `rectangle`, and others will produce errors if students attempt to apply the Associative Property.}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{categorize-functions.adoc}, where you will synthesize what you have learned about the Commutative Property and Associative Property in both math and @proglang.
- Complete the table then respond to the questions.
}

=== Synthesize

- What did you learn about the Associative Property in @proglang? Did anything surprise you?
- How were the programming activities in this lesson similar to the paper-and-pencil activities? How were they different?
