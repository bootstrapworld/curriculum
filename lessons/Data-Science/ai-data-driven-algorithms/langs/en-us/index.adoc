== Spell Checkers as AI @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students think about spell checkers, considering how their programmed behavior is both similar to and different from the behavior of humans.


=== Launch

Over the past few years, you've probably heard some buzz about Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology that enables computers to perform tasks that were once thought to be for _humans only_.

Ever since the word processing packages started to regularly include spell checking programs, the task of searching out and correcting spelling errors has largely been considered a thing of the past.

But when it comes to spell checking, how does the performance of a computer compare to that of a human? Do humans and computers use similar spell checking strategies?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete Part 1 of @printable-exercise{human-spell-checking.adoc}.
- Be prepared to summarize the method that you used for spell checking:
** How do you locate misspelled words?
** How do you correct misspelled words?
}

You probably noticed that is was difficult to articulate how exactly you were able to locate and correct spelling mistakes. Why?

We are not computers! We rely on context clues and intuition. There were probably students in your class who said that the spelling mistakes jumped off the page. They couldn't *not* see the mistakes. Other students relied on context clues or prior knowledge to locate and fix errors. Of course, the process of spell-checking varies not just by person but by situation, too. If a different word had been misspelled, perhaps a multi-syllabic and complex technical word, you might have relied on a different spell checking strategy.

How can a computer possibly navigate such a nuanced and complex process?


=== Investigate

The very first spell checker was developed in 1961 at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It did not have mastery of the English language. Instead, its creators provided the spell checker program with a 10,000-word dictionary and a precise algorithm to follow. Here is what the algorithm entailed:

[.indentedpara]
--
- *First*, it would develop alternative candidates for the misspelled word (input) by making one of the following adjustments: (1) replace a single letter with a different one, or (2) swap the positions of two adjacent letters.

- *Next*, it would search the provided dictionary to see which alternatives were valid options.

- *Finally*, it would produce a list of valid correctly spelled words for the user to choose from.
--

Unsurprisingly, spell checkers have evolved a lot since 1961 - but exploring this particular algorithm can offer us interesting insights about one of the earliest forms of AI.

@lesson-instruction{
- In Part 1 of @printable-exercise{first-spell-checker.adoc}, __you__ will be the computer, following the spell checking algorithm developed at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1961.
- Once you've completed Part 1, move on to Part 2, where you will reflect on the activity.

@teacher{
After students have completed the activity, invite them to share their responses to the four reflection questions (below) in small groups.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you think are some limitations of the first spell checker's algorithm?}
@Q{What are some of the advantages of this algorithm?}
@Q{How is the first spell checker's algorithm similar to whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing?}
@Q{How is the first spell checker's algorithm different from whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing?}
}

As you discovered during @printable-activity{human-spell-checking.adoc}, when *you* spell check, you rely on intuition, instinct, and context clues. When AI spell checks, on the other hand, it relies on computational brute force: even the most primitive spell checking program will repeatedly edit the misspelled word, generating dozens of different letter combinations to verify in the dictionary. The computer works quickly - but the work that it completes would be time-consuming and laborious for a human.

== Spell Checking in Pyret @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

=== Launch

By now, we have a decent sense of the extensive work that is happening behind the scenes when we spell check our writing. We have *not*, however, discussed an essential truth about spell checkers and in fact *all Artificial Intelligence*: it is "data driven".

@QandA{
@Q{Where have you encountered the term "data driven" before, if at all?}
@Q{Have you ever met anyone who is "data driven"? (Teachers? Coaches? Parents?)}
@Q{What do you think it means to be "data driven"?}
}




=== Investigate


@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{pyret-spell-checker.adoc} using the @starter-file{spell-checker}.
- If you finish early, try the two challenge problems at the bottom of the page!
}

When we offered _more data_ to our rudimentary Pyret spell checker, we got better results _without changing the code_.

Data is at the heart of data science, and _data-driven_ algorithms are at the heart of AI. This statement is true not just of spell checkers, but of all artificial intelligence.

@lesson-instruction{
- Consider a different scenario, @printable-exercise{case-study-michelle.adoc}.
- Read the brief story and respond to the question, providing as much detail as you can.
}

@teacher{Invite students to share their responses, emphasizing that data-driven algorithms produce a higher quality output when we provide more data. Changing the code is not needed. When change to the code _does_ happen, it is done by humans.}
