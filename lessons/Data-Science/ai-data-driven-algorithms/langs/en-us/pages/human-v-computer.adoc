= Spell Checking: Humans vs. Computers

Respond to the prompts below, first considering the algorithm that *you* use to spell check, and then predicting what algorithm a computer might use.

== Part 1: Human Spell Checking (Reflect)

Read this sentence: _"Before beginning the lesson, the teacher said wello to her students and asked them how thay were doing."_

@n What is the first word that is spelled incorrectly? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{wello}} How did you know that that word was misspelled? Explain in as much detail as you can. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What correctly spelled word do you think the author intended to put in place of the misspelled word? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{hello}}  How did you choose that word in particular, rather than another close option  (perhaps "cello", or "fellow")? @fitb{}{}

@n Do you think a 6-year old would be able to identify and correct the first misspelled word in this sentence? Explain.  @fitb{}{}

@n What is the second word that is spelled incorrectly? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{thay}} How did you know that that word was misspelled? Explain in as much detail as you can. @fitb{}{}

@n What correctly spelled word do you think the author intended to put in place of the misspelled word? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{they}} How did you choose that word in particular, rather than another close option  (perhaps "that", "thaw", or "stay")? @fitb{}{}
