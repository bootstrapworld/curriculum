= A Pyret Spell Checker

@link-instructions{Open the @starter-file{spell-checker} and click "Run".} Follow each of the instructions below to discover how our very own Pyret spell checker works.

@n One at a time, test each line of code (below) in the Interactions Area of the @starter-file{spell-checker}:

- `go("wello", WORDS-1000)`

- `go("wello", WORDS-ALL)`

How are the results similar? How are they different? @fitb{}{}

@n Why does `go` produce different results when we change the second argument? (Not sure? Visit @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XD726tuYLW_WQqbEdhKo22Xt3gJumQ6vfJ1PVMkwmYA/edit?usp=sharing, "this spreadsheet"}, which the spell checker refers to in line 8.) @fitb{}{}

@n Is Pyret using the same algorithm as the @printable-exercise{first-spell-checker.adoc}? If not, what is different and how do you know? What is similar?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Test `go("wello", WORDS-100)` in the Interactions Area. What does Pyret return? @fitb{}{}

@n The function `go` is _supposed_ to produce a list of possible correctly spelled alternatives for the misspelled word, drawn from the provided dictionary. Why didn't we get any alternatives from this line of code? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}


@n Test `go("dinosars", WORDS-100)` in the Interactions Area. Why doesn't the spell checker produce results this time? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}


@n Do you think Pyret's algorithm produces _better_ or _worse_ results than the very first spell checker? Explain. In responding, consider each of the tests that you have run (above). @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Make a prediction: Will `go("hello", WORDS-ALL)` produce the same output as `go("wello", WORDS-ALL)`?  @fitb{5em}{}

@n Test the two lines of code. Was your prediction )above) correct? @fitb{5em}{} Explain. @fitb{}{}

@star Can you produce an input that matches more than one word in the @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XD726tuYLW_WQqbEdhKo22Xt3gJumQ6vfJ1PVMkwmYA/edit?usp=sharing, "third (100-word) dictionary"}? If so, what is it? @fitb{}{}

@star "W1" and "W2" represent two different five-letter words. If `go("W1", WORDS-ALL)` produces a list that includes "W2", will `go("W2", WORDS-ALL)` produce a list that includes "W1"?@fitb{}{}
