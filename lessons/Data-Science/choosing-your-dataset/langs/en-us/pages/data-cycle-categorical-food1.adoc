Using the @opt-starter-file{food}, let's make a @ifproglang{pyret}{*pie-chart*}@ifproglang{codap}{*bar chart*} to see what we can learn about the distribution of land-locked countries and what new questions it may lead us to.

@data-cycle{ ""
  #:question "Are more countries land-locked or not land-locked?"
  #:show-question? #t
  #:question-type "arithmetic"
  #:rows "All the rows"
  #:show-rows? #f

  #:show-expression? #f
  #:finding "The number of land-locked countries (37) is about 1/3 the number of not land-locked countries (124)."

The chart shows that there are @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{less}}{less / as many / more} land-locked countries than not land-locked countries.

Some new questions this raises include:

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{How does the ratio of land-locked to not land-locked countries differ by population density?
}}

Let's make a *bar chart* to see what we can learn about the distribution of countries across regions and what new questions it may lead us to.

  #:show-expression? #f
  #:finding "There are 2 more countries in Europe (40) than in the Asia-Pacific region (38)."

The chart shows that there are @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{2}} more countries in Europe than there are in the Asia-Pacific Region.
