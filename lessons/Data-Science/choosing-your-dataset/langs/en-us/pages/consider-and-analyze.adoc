= Consider and Analyze

Fill in the tables below by considering the rows and columns you need. Look up the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contract} for the display and record the Pyret code you'd need to make it. If time allows, type your code into the editor to see your display! _The first column has been filled in for you._
