= Consider and Analyze

Fill in the tables below by considering the rows and columns you need. @ifproglang{pyret}{Look up the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contract} for the display and record the Pyret code you'd need to make it.} If time allows, type your code into @starter-file{editor} to see your display!
