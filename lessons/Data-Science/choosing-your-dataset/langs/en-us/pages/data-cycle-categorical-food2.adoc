The multi-bar chart shows that @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{most}}{most / some / a few} regions have more food independent countries than not. I also notice @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This dataset only counts two countries as North American.}}

@vspace{1ex}

Some new questions this raises include:

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{Who decides which region a country belongs to?}
}

The stacked bar chart shows that @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{most}}{most / some / a few} regions have a dominant religious majority. I also notice @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Regions colonized by Europe are predominantly Christian.}}

@vspace{1ex}

Some new questions this raises include:

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{I have friends who aren't Christians and focusing on religious majorities makes it look like all of North America is Christian. How good of a measure if the majority really? What percentage of North American citizens are not part of the religious majority?
}}
