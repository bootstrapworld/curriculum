| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Explain why they chose their dataset
* Describe their dataset
* Make subsets from their dataset

| Student-facing Lesson Goals

| Preparation
|
* Decide how much choice you're ready to offer your students before you begin. Research shows that choice increases student engagement! But focusing the whole class on a single dataset is also an option.
** Would focusing your students on a single dataset make this doable for you? Because you teach younger students who might need more scaffolding? Or because you are new to teaching data science and managing fewer moving parts would increase your confidence? We recommend focusing on @opt-starter-file{food}.
** Are you ready to jump straight into supporting your students in working on a wide range of topics of their choosing? We have a full dataset library!
** Want to give students choice from a shorter curated list...to shorten the decision-making process, focus on topics related to curriculur goals, or just to have fewer options to manage during class?  We've assembled @link{about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.html, descriptions of individual datasets here}. For those looking for a precurated shorter list, we've starred a few of them for you.
** *If you have time*, you may want to complete all of the lessons with everyone getting extra practice analyzing @opt-starter-file{food} and then have your students choose a dataset to analyze for their culminating research papers!

* All students (or pairs) should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Animals Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can open the @starter-file{animals}.

== Review: Consider Data @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students practice making lots of chart types, focusing specifically on the "Consider Data" step in the Data Cycle and how it can be used alongside Contracts to help go from questions to code.

=== Launch

The Data Cycle is a roadmap that guides us in the process of data analysis. You've learned that the Data Cycle includes four steps. Let's review what those steps entail.

@lesson-instruction{
- In the *Ask Questions* phase of the Data Cycle, what are some of the different types of questions we can ask?
** _Lookup, arithmetic, and statistical questions._
- What's the difference between an arithmetic question question and a statistical question?
** _A statistical question does not specify a particular arithmetic process, while an arithmetic question does._
- What does the *Consider Data* phase entail?
** _We need to ask two questions: "What rows should we investigate?" and "What columns do we need?"_
- During the *Analyze Data* phase of the Data Cycle, we choose what kind of display we'll need to answer our question. Which two displays work with categorical data? Why might you choose one over the other?
** _Bar and pie charts work with categorical data. A pie chart only makes sense when you have the full picture, whereas a bar chart shows the count._
- In your own words, what happens during the *Interpret the Data* phase?
** _We answer questions and summarize results, which often leads to new questions._
}

=== Investigate

In this lesson, we're going to get some practice with the second step of the cycle - Consider Data. This entails isolating the Rows and Columns needed to answer various questions, and using our knowledge of Contracts to help turn those questions into working code!

@lesson-instruction{
Complete @printable-exercise{consider-and-analyze.adoc}.
}

@teacher{Be sure to review student answers.}

=== Synthesize

- What strategies did you use to determine which columns to isolate?
- Why do the contracts for some displays require more arguments than others?




== Choosing a Dataset @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students select a dataset that interests them, and do some thinking about _why_ it interests them, _what questions they'd like to answer_ and _what hypotheses they have_. They'll be analyzing this data for a long time, so it's critical to ensure a high degree of buy-in before signing off on a student's choice!

=== Launch

@teacher{
Note: *If you are opting to focus your whole class on a single dataset, we recommend skipping this section of the lesson.* _You'll instead want to jump to "Dataset Exploration Project.")_
}

**Data Science: it's all about YOU!**

What data matters to *_you?_* What questions do *_you_* care about? We live in a world filled with data, gathered about almost every subject you can imagine.

- Climate sensors are gathering data on temperature, humidity, oxygen and more...practically everywhere on the globe.
- Census data tracks the number of different groups of people, as well as their education, income level, and more.
- Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google gather massive amounts of data on the websites you visit, what you chat about online, what you purchase, etc.

This data is used to set public policy, draw voting districts, approve drugs, calculate school funding, decide which advertisements you see, and more.

@lesson-instruction{
* Where else do you see data being gathered?
* What are some other ways data is used in the world around you?
}

Below is a list of every @vocab{dataset} already provided to students, with a corresponding Starter File that instantly imports the (cleaned) data into Pyret. We suggest giving students @handout{pages/datasets-and-starter-files.adoc, a direct link to this page}, which lists all of the relevant links found in the lesson plan.

@teacher{
_Students can also find their own dataset_, and use this @starter-file{blank-ds}. See this @starter-file{blank-ds-tutorial} for help importing your own data into Pyret.


For teachers using a single dataset, we recommend using @opt-starter-file{food}._ This dataset focuses on global food supply and production through environmental / geographic / cultural lenses and the variables were carefully selected to make sure it lends itself well for all kinds of data displays and discussions. You can, of course, opt to choose any dataset you'd like, from our library or otherwise.

**NOTE:** _We have compiled some @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.adoc, Notes on our provided datasets}, to help you decide which might be most useful in your classroom._
}
=== Investigate
Have students choose a dataset that is interesting to them and save a copy of it in their programs!

@include{fragments/dataset-table.adoc}

=== Synthesize
- What did you select, and why?
- What questions did you come up with?

For the rest of this course, you'll be learning new programming and @vocab{Data Science} skills, practicing them with the Animals Dataset and then applying them to you own data.

== Dataset Exploration Project @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to the Dataset Exploration Project. They will apply what they have learned to add three items to their @starter-file{exploration-project}: (1) a description their dataset, including its source, structure, and relevance, (2) at least one bar chart, (3) at least one pie chart, and (4) any interesting questions they develop. To learn more about the sequence and scope of the exploration project, visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration}.)

=== Launch

Today, we are going to start digging into the datasets we've chosen to study at length. Each time we learn about a new data science concept in this class, we will add displays, questions, and analyses to the @starter-file{exploration-project} template.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the blank template for the @starter-file{exploration-project}.
- Create and save your own copy of the slide deck.
- Let's take a look! Peruse the slides to get a sense of what this cumulative project includes.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Students will likely notice that many displays they are unfamiliar with are referenced. They may wonder how there is going to be so much analysis on just one dataset!_
}

@teacher{
Encourage students to familiarize themselves with the template, highlighting some important features:

- Blue text is included to provide examples.

- Slides can be duplicated if students want to add additional displays or interpretations.
}

=== Investigate

By now you've already learned what to do when you approach a new dataset. Think back to your first exposure to the Animals Dataset. You read the data and wrote down your Notices and Wonders. You described the columns. You even took some @vocab{random samples} of the dataset to explore @vocab{inference} and probability.

Now, you're doing to do the same thing _with your own dataset._

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your chosen dataset starter file in Pyret.
- Look at the spreadsheet or table for your dataset. What do you *Notice*? What do you *Wonder*?
- Complete @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}, making sure to include at least two questions that __can__ be answered by your dataset and one that __cannot__.
* Save a copy of your starter file. In the Definitions Area, use `random-rows` to define *at least three* tables of different sizes: `tiny-sample`, `small-sample`, and `medium-sample`.
}

Today we will begin adding to our @starter-file{exploration-project}. First, we are going to describe our dataset.

@lesson-instruction{
- *It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*
- Complete all of the slides you see in the "About this Dataset" portion of the slide deck. It may be helpful to refer to @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
Ensure that students have thoughtfully described their datasets. Then, explain that they are going to add  bar and pie charts, along with their interpretations of them.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Choose one categorical column from your dataset that you will represent with a bar chart.
- What question does your display answer?
- Now, write down that question in the top section of @printable-exercise{data-cycle-categorical.adoc}.
- Complete the rest of the data cycle, recording how you considered, analyzed, and interpreted the question.
- Repeat this process for at least one more categorical column - but this time, create a pie chart.
}

@teacher{
Once students have at least one bar and pie chart, it's time to add their findings to the @starter-file{exploration-project}.
}

@lesson-instruction{
Copy/paste at least one bar chart and one pie chart into your slide deck. Be sure to also add any interesting questions that you developed while making and thinking about these displays.
}

@teacher{
_You may need to help students locate the “Bar Charts” section and the “Pie Charts” section. The “My Questions” slide is at the end of the template._
}

=== Synthesize

Share your findings with the class!

Did you discover anything surprising or interesting about your dataset?

What questions did the bar and pie charts inspire raise?

Did other students make any discoveries that were surprising or interesting to you?
