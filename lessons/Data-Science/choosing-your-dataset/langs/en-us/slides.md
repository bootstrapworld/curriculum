# Review

Let's get some practice isolating the Rows and Columns needed to answer various questions, and use our knowledge of Contracts to help turn those questions into working code!

Complete @printable-exercise{consider-and-analyze.adoc}.

# Choosing a Dataset

**Data Science: it's all about YOU!**

We live in a world filled with data, gathered about almost every subject you can imagine.

- **Climate sensors** are gathering data on temperature, humidity, oxygen and more...practically everywhere on the globe.
- **Census data** tracks the number of different groups of people, as well as their education, income level, and more.
- Companies like **Facebook, Amazon, and Google** gather massive amounts of data on the websites you visit, what you chat about online, what you purchase, etc.

# Choosing a Dataset

This data is used to set public policy, draw voting districts, approve drugs, calculate school funding, decide which advertisements you see, and more.

* Where else do you see data being gathered?
* What are some other ways data is used in the world around you?

# Choosing a Dataset

**Here Come the Datasets!**

Working in pairs, explore the list of @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2023/en-us/lessons/choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.html, provided datasets}. 

Which one is the most interesting to you?

When you've selected a dataset to work on, open the Starter File and save a copy.

<!--
_Students can also find their own dataset_, and use this @starter-file{blank-ds}. See this @starter-file{blank-ds-tutorial} for help importing your own data into Pyret.

**NOTE:** _We have compiled some @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.adoc, Notes on our provided datasets}, to help you decide which might be most useful in your classroom._

# Choosing a Dataset

* Look at the spreadsheet for your dataset. What do you *Notice*? What do you *Wonder*?
* Complete @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}, making sure to include at least two questions that __can__ be answered by their dataset and one that __cannot__.

# Choosing a Dataset

- What did you select, and why?
- What questions did you come up with?

For the rest of this course, you'll be learning new programming and Data Science skills, practicing them with the Animals Dataset and then applying them to you own data.

# Exploring Your Dataset 

By now you've already learned what to do when you approach a new dataset.

- With the Animals Dataset, you first read the data itself, and wrote down your Notices and Wonders.
- You described the columns in the Animals Dataset, identifying which were categorical and which were quantitative, and whether they were Numbers, Strings, Booleans, etc.
- You took random samples of the dataset, to explore inference and probability

Now, you're going to do the same thing **with your own dataset.**

# Exploring Your Dataset 

Look at the spreadsheet or table for your dataset with your partner and complete @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}, making sure to include at least two questions that __can__ be answered by your dataset and one that __cannot__.

# Exploring Your Dataset 

- Open the starter file for your chosen dataset and save a copy. 
- In the Definitions Area, use `random-rows` to define *at least three* tables of different sizes: `tiny-sample`, `small-sample`, and `medium-sample`.
- Make a copy of @starter-file{exploration-project} and share it with your partner(s) and your teacher.

# Exploring Your Dataset 

Collaborate with your partner(s), to fill in the first two pages of your @starter-file{exploration-project}, drawing on the thinking you did on @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}.

Remember: More than one person can work on a google doc at the same time! If you have access to two computers, someone can work on page 1 while someone else works on page 2!

# Exploring Your Dataset

- What is the distribution of data in your categorical columns? Turn to Complete @printable-exercise{data-cycle-categorical.adoc}, and use the Data Cycle to generate pie and bar charts.
- What do these charts tell you? Add the images of these charts - along with your interpretation! - to the "Making Displays" section of your @starter-file{exploration-project}.
- Do these displays bring up any interesting questions? If so, add them to the end of the document.

# Exploring Your Dataset

- What dataset did you choose? 
- Why is it interesting or important to you?
- What did your pie and bar charts tell you?
