= Esports Earnings

- This dataset includes data from 1998-2020 that comes from https://www.esportsearnings.com, a publicly-sourced repository of information on esports earnings.
- This dataset has a limited number of categories, making it accessible to any student.
- The columns of this dataset require calculations to convert data before students start making graphs.
- *Column Titles:* game, release-date, genre, total-earnings (total earnings of all players in all tournaments), online-earnings (total earnings of all players in online-only tournaments), total-winners (total number of tournament winners in all tournaments), total tournaments (total number of tournaments that took place from the release date to 2020)
- *Have students...*
  * *define a function* online-ratio, which returns the ratio of online-earnings to total-earnings for a game.
  * *define a function* annual-earnings, which returns the average earnings per year since the release date for a game.
- *Heads Up*
  *  Note that since the data is publicly sourced, there are games with no earnings and no tournaments. Additionally, the nature of the data means that there are a few extremely large outliers that the student will have to deal with when analyzing the data.
  * The data for many less popular games varies greatly due to one-off tournaments. Additionally, the number of games with zero tournaments and zero players may vary, as the data is publicly sourced. Thus, it is recommended that comparisons between genres be done with subsets containing the games with the highest earnings, as much more data is available for those games.
  * Other metrics that may be interesting to the student for analysis are the average earnings per year since release and the average number of tournaments per year since the release year of the game or 1998--whichever comes second.
  * Keep in mind that the data only includes tournaments that occur from 1998 to 2020, even though some of the games included in the dataset were released before 1998.
