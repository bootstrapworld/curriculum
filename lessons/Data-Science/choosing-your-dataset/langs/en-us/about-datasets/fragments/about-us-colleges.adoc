= Colleges in the US (2019-2020)

- This dataset includes data from 3232 post-secondary educational institutions in the United States during the school year (2019-2020).
- Students applying to colleges can use this dataset to evaluate their options given their monetary, locational, and other preferences.
- This dataset has a huge number of columns that will excite some students and may overwhelm others.
- The columns of this dataset require calculations to convert data before students start making graphs.
- *Column Titles:* School Name, City, State, Urbanicity, Region, Control, Program, Highest Degree, Gender, Operating, Main Campus, HBCU, Indigenous, US Service, Converted SAT Range, Undergrad Population, Acceptance Rate, Part-time Student Ratio, Average Monthly Faculty Salary, In-state Tuition, Out-of-state Tuition, Pell Grant, Average Cost of Attendance, Average Net Price 
- *Have students...*
  * *define* a function all-pell-grant, which computes the total number of undergraduate students in all universities that received a Pell grant. 
  * *define* a function same-tuition, which returns true if a school has the same in-state and out-of-state tuition.
  * *define* a function average-fin-aid, which returns the difference between a school’s cost of attendance and net price.
  * *define* a function low-accept, which returns true if a school has less than a 10% acceptance rate.
  * filter out a list of all schools in their state and compare them.
  * filter out a list of all schools in the “1500+” Converted SAT Range and compare them with a filtered list of all schools with less than 0.1 acceptance rate.
- *Heads Up*
  * Note that a few schools may have a negative net price, suggesting that some students may actually end up receiving money for attending the particular school.
  * Acceptance rates of 1 mean virtually everyone is accepted, though there may still be special circumstances in which a particular student is rejected.
  * Some schools lacking significant data may be excluded from this dataset of 3232 colleges.
