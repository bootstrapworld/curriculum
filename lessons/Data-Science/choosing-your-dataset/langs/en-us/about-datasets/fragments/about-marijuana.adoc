= Marijuana Arrests and Laws by State

- This dataset looks at marijuana arrest records for the year 2018 in 49 US States (data was unavailable for Florida), and breaks these arrests down by race. Each state also includes data for the years marijuana was legalized and/or decriminalized, and/or when medical marijuana was legalized.
- This dataset has a limited number of categories, making it accessible to any student.
- The columns of this dataset require calculations to convert data before students start making graphs.
- *Column Titles:*  State, All Drug Arrests, Total Marijuana Arrests, Total Marijuana Possession Arrests, Black Marijuana Possession Arrests, White Marijuana Possession Arrests, Black Population, White Population, Total Population, Marijuana Legalized (year), Marijuana Decriminalized (year), Medical Marijuana Legalized (year)
- *Have students...*
  * *define a function* pct-marijuana, which computes the percent of drug arrests that were marijuana arrests.
- *Heads Up*
  * A few states have multiple dates for medical marijuana legalization, denoted by listing the two dates
separated by a slash.
  * In order to compare between states, percentages will need to be calculated. These could include 
the percentage of a population that is black or white, the percentage of marijuana arrests that were
of a black or white person, or the percentage of total arrests that were for marijuana possession.
  * It may also make sense to split data into groups depending on whether marijuana/medical marijuana was legalized, decriminalized, or illegal.
