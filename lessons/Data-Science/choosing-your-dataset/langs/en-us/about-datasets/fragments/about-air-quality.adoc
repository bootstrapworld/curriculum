= Air Quality and Related Data by US County

- This data mostly comes from censuses completed by either the federal or state government. Besides the census, the dataset also includes information from the U.S Energy and Information Administration and the Bureau of Economic Analysis The dataset can be narrowed down through the isolation of states or even geographical location. 
- This dataset has many applications in the real world. For example, if the government wants to try to spread out new power plants, and try to understand how they might affect the population. The government also spends a lot of money on medicare, and one might be interested in lowering that amount by lowering some of the causes of disease. 
- This dataset has a huge number of columns that will excite some students and may overwhelm others.
- The columns of this dataset are defined to allow students to start analysis without much additional coding. Though there are many columns that the students could use to narrow down the amount of rows which might count as additional coding.
- *Column Titles:*
State, County, Full Name, FIPS Code, Median AQI, Median Income, Population Size, Urban, Rural, Metro, Rural-Urban Continuum Code, % White (Non-Hispanic), % Other Races (Hispanic Included), Estimated Asthma Prevalence in Population by Medicare Spending, Cancer Incidence Rate (cases per 100,000), Cancer Projection, Total Number of Power Plants, Primary Power Plant Type, Total C02 Emissions from Power Plants (tons), Mean Travel Time to Work (Minutes), Life Expectancy (years), Main Industry by # of Employees, % Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting of Total Industries, % Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction of Total Industries, % Transportation and warehousing of Total Industries, Interstate Highway in County?
- *Have students...*
  * Isolate factors by narrowing down the data by urban/rural/metropolitan areas, states, or main industry. 
  * *define a function* pct-industry, which computes the percent of a certain industry in America by County
  * *define a function* state-income, that finds the median income for an entire state
  * *define a function* missing-counties, that given a full list of counties finds which ones are missing on the spreadsheet
- *Heads Up*
  * The data does not include Minnesota as they do not publish medical information by county. 
  * The data used to include Puerto Rico but was taken out for the same reason. This is a shame, as Puerto Rico has incredibly high rates of Asthma which would be interesting to study. 
  * The data contains varying times of collection– for example, median income was collected in 2018, while the AQI data is from 2021. All data is post 2016. 
  * It might be helpful to find the population density in each county so we can understand the spread of some of the factors (such as power plants or interstate highways), although I believe the rural-urban continuum code is a good proxy.
