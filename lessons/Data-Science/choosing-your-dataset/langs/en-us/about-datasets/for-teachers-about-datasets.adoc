= Dataset Notes

We've written a description of each dataset including suggestions and things to be aware of as you support students.  Given that these datasets are from the real world, they are not all equally conducive for all learning goals.

== A Second Teaching Dataset with Additional Scaffolding

The @opt-starter-file{food} was designed for teachers looking to anchor additional practice across our curricula in real data. You'll find links to data cycles specific to this dataset in some of our lessons. Because neither the data cycle nor this dataset are introduced before the bar and pie chart lesson, those two pages of scaffolded data cycles are only available here.
