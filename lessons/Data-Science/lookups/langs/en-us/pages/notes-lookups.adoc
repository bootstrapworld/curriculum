= Lookups in a Nutshell

*Let's Review...*

We can define names for values in Pyret, the same way we do in math:

```
x = 7
name = "Shanti"
age = 16
logo = star(50, "solid", "red")
snuffles   = row-n(animals-table, 1)
```

When *looking up a data Row* from a Table, programmers use the `row-n` function. This function takes a Table and a Number as its inputs. +
The numbers tell the computer which Row we want from the Table. _Note: Rows are numbered starting at zero!_

For example:
```
row-n(animals-table, 0)  				#  the first row
row-n(animals-table, 2)  				#  the third row
```

When we define these rows, it's most useful to name them based on their _properties_ (rather than their identifiers, e.g. snuffles):
```
rabbit-row = row-n(animals-table, 1) 	# Snuffles is a rabbit
cat-row = row-n(animals-table,  0) 		# Sasha is a cat
dog-row = row-n(animals-table, 10) 		# Toggle is a dog
```

*What's New?*

When *looking up a column* from a Row, programmers use square brackets and the name of the column they want.

For example:
```
row-n(animals-table, 0)["age"]     		# look up Sasha's age (in row 0)
cat-row["species"]                 		# look up Sasha's age (using the defined name)

# Note: Both of these examples produce the same thing!
# Using defined expressions allows us to simplify our code.

```

Values produced from lookups can be used as part of Pyret expressions:

```
# Number expressions
dog-row["age"] + 2
cat-row["age"] > 10

# String expressions
string-contains(dog-row["name"], "Kujo")
cat-row["name"] == "Sasha"

# Boolean expressions
dog-row["fixed"] and (dog-row["age"] < 5)

# Image expressions
triangle(dog-row["pounds"], "solid", "green")
scale(cat-row["age"], triangle(20, "solid", "green"))
```
