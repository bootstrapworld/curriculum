We've already given you two row definitions: `cat-dog` and `dog-row`:

```
cat-row = row-n(animals-table,  0)  # Sasha is a cat
dog-row = row-n(animals-table, 10)  # Toggle is a dog
```

**Remember: rows start at index zero!** Use this to answer the questions below. (HINT: turn to @printable-exercise{ds-intro/pages/animals-dataset.adoc} and number the data rows first, then answer the questions below.)

@n The index of a row containing a lizard is 				@right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{21 or 22}}}

@n The index of a row containing a rabbit is 				@right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{1 or 24}}}

@n The index of a row containing a fixed animal is 			@right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}}

@n The index of a row containing a male animal 				@right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}}

@n The index of a row containing a female animal is 		@right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}}

@n The index of a row containing a hermaphroditic animal is @right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{6}}}

@n The index of a row containing an unfixed animal is 		@right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}}

@n The index of a row containing a young animal (<2 years) is @right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}}

@n The index of a row containing an old animal (>10 years) is @right{@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}}

@n What code would you write to define `lizard-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{possible solution: @show{(code '(define lizard-row (row-n animals-table 21)))}}}

@n What code would you write to define `rabbit-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{possible solution: @show{(code '(define rabbit-row (row-n animals-table 1)))}}}

@n What code would you write to define `fixed-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}

@n What code would you write to define `male-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}

@n What code would you write to define `female-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}

@n What code would you write to define `hermaphrodite-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}

@n What code would you write to define `young-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}

@n What code would you write to define `old-row`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary}}
