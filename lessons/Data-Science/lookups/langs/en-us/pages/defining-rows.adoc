**Remember: rows start at index zero!**

We've already given you two row definitions, `cat-dog` and `dog-row`:

```
cat-row = row-n(animals-table,  0)  # Sasha is a cat
dog-row = row-n(animals-table, 10)  # Toggle is a dog
```

@n Use the @dist-link{courses/data-science/back-matter/pages/animals-dataset.adoc, Animals Table} to identify the index of a row containing...

[cols="1, 3a, 3a, 8", stripes="none", shading="none", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
|| a lizard 					| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{21 or 22}}					|
|| a rabbit 					| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1 or 24}}						|
|| a fixed animal 				| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{many options, including 1}}	|
|| a male animal 				| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{many options, including 4}}	|
|| a female animal  	 		| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{many options, including 0}}	|
|| a hermaphroditic animal 		| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{6}}							|	
|| an unfixed animal 			| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{many options, including 0}}	|
|| a young animal (<2 years) 	| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{many options, including 0}}	|
|| an old animal (>10 years) 	| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{many options, including 4}}	|
