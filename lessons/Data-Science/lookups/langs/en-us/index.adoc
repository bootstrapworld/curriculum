== Row Lookups @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to define values in Pyret, and practice by defining Numbers, Strings, and Images. They also learn how to define an individual row from a table in Pyret.

=== Launch

Sometimes we have a value that we want to use again and again, and it makes sense to define a name for it. Every definition includes a _name_ and a _value_. In the code below, we have definitions for a String, a Number and an Image.

```
name = "Denny"
age = 16
logo = star(50, "solid", "red")
```

@QandA{
@Q{What are the names given in each of these definitions?}
@A{name, age, and logo}
@Q{What are the values given to each of these names?}
@A{The String "Denny", the Number 16, and an Image of a solid red star.}
}

=== Investigate

Examples of lookup questions include, “How many legs does Felix have?” or "What species is Sheba?"

@QandA{
@Q{How many rows do we need to answer a Lookup question?}
@A{Just one! Lookups can be answered just by finding the right row!}
}

@teacher{
Make sure students understand we only need one row!
}

*What code can we write, to let us define a single row?* 

- Tables have special functions associated with them, which allow us to do all sorts of things. 
- For example, we can get the first @vocab{data row} in a table by using the @show{(code 'row-n)} function: 
  * `row-n(animals-table, 0)`

Remember: Data rows start at index _zero_!

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your saved Animals Starter File (or make a new @starter-file{animals} copy), and click “Run”.
- In the Interactions Area, use the `row-n` function to get the second and third data rows.
- Find `row-n` on the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Page}. @pathway-only{_If you're working with a printed workbook, the contracts pages are included in the back._}
}

@QandA{
@Q{What is its Domain? Its Range?}
@A{Its domain is Number. Its range is Row.}
}

@slidebreak

The code below will define the first row from the animals table:

`sasha = row-n(animals-table, 0)`

It's often better to name our Row definitions according to the _property we care about_. In this case, the fact that this row is a cat is _much_ more interesting than the fact that her name is Sasha:

`cat-row = row-n(animals-table, 0)`

@QandA{
@Q{How would you get the _second_ row out of the animals table? The third?}
@A{`row-n(animals-table, 1)` will get the second row}
@A{`row-n(animals-table, 2)` will get the third row}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- In the Animals Dataset, there are subsets that we might want to analyze: dogs, cats, lizards, old animals, young animals, fixed animals, etc.
- Complete @printable-exercise{defining-rows.adoc}.
- When you're done, open your saved Animals Starter File (or make a new @starter-file{animals} copy) and add these definitions after the definitions for `dog-row` and `cat-row`.
- The rows you added will be used later!
}


=== Synthesize
- We named rows by a lot of different properties (e.g. - their species, sex, etc). What are some other properties of rows in this dataset that we could use?
- What are some properties of *your dataset* that you might want to define rows for?

== Column Lookups @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to access a particular column from a row.

=== Launch
We can also access _columns_ of a Row, by using a *Row Accessor*. Row accessors start with a Row value, followed by square brackets, and the name of the column where the value can be found. Here are three examples that use row accessors to get at different columns from the first row in the animals-table:

```
row-n(animals-table, 0)["name"]
row-n(animals-table, 0)["age"]
row-n(animals-table, 0)["fixed"]
```

And of course, we can use our defined name, substituting it in place of all the redundant code:

```
cat-row["name"]
cat-row["age"]
cat-row["fixed"]
```

=== Synthesize
Why is it important to be able to define individual rows?

@pd-slide{
Tables have tons of data - of all different types! - arranged into Rows and Columns. They feel like a monolith.

With lookups, we've given kids surgical precision to hone in on _an individual row_, and to hone in on an _individual value_ from that row. That might be kind of important if we want to do something like... *filter a table* showing only the individual rows where species equals dog.

Now we can use definitions to make our lives easier! If we find that we're writing the same thing over and over and over, we could just define `cat-row` instead of needing to retype all the lookup code every time.
