== Defining Rows @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students review value definitions in Pyret, and practice extracting individual rows for later use.

=== Launch

Sometimes we have a value that we want to use again and again, and it makes sense to define a name for it. Every definition includes a _name_ and a _value_. In the code below, we have definitions for a String, a Number and an Image.

```
name = "Denny"
age = 16
logo = star(50, "solid", "red")
```

@QandA{
@Q{What are the names given in each of these definitions?}
@A{name, age, and logo}
@Q{What are the values given to each of these names?}
@A{The String "Denny", the Number 16, and an Image of a solid red star.}
}

=== Investigate

*What code can we write, to let us define a single row?* 

- You already know a function that extracts an individual row!
- For example, we can get the first @vocab{data row} in a table by using the @show{(code 'row-n)} function: 
  * `row-n(animals-table, 0)`

Remember: Data rows start at index _zero_!

@slidebreak

The code below will define the first row from the animals table:

`sasha = row-n(animals-table, 0)`

It's often better to name our Row definitions according to the _property we care about_. In this case, the fact that this row is a cat is _much_ more interesting than the fact that her name is Sasha:

`cat-row = row-n(animals-table, 0)`

@QandA{
@Q{How would you get the _second_ row out of the animals table? The third?}
@A{`row-n(animals-table, 1)` will get the second row}
@A{`row-n(animals-table, 2)` will get the third row}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- In the Animals Dataset, there are subsets that we might want to analyze: dogs, cats, lizards, old animals, young animals, fixed animals, etc.
- Complete @printable-exercise{defining-rows.adoc}.
- When you're done, open your saved Animals Starter File (or make a new @starter-file{animals} copy) and add these definitions after the definitions for `dog-row` and `cat-row`.
- The rows you added will be used later!
}


=== Synthesize
- We named rows by a lot of different properties (e.g. - their species, sex, etc). What are some other properties of rows in this dataset that we could use?
- What are some properties of *your dataset* that you might want to define rows for?

== Column Lookups @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to access a particular column from a row.

=== Launch
We can also access _columns_ of a Row, by using a *Row Accessor*. Row accessors start with a Row value, followed by square brackets, and the name of the column where the value can be found. Here are three examples that use row accessors to get at different columns from the first row in the animals-table:

```
row-n(animals-table, 0)["name"]
row-n(animals-table, 0)["age"]
row-n(animals-table, 0)["fixed"]
```

And of course, we can use our defined name, substituting it in place of all the redundant code:

```
cat-row["name"]
cat-row["age"]
cat-row["fixed"]
```

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{lookup-questions-matching.adoc}.
- Complete @printable-exercise{more-practice-w-lookups.adoc}
}


@slidebreak

Sometimes we want to ask questions about a specific Row, or do some computations with that Row:

- Is the age of our `lizard-row` animal more than 3?
- How many _kilograms_ does our `rabbit-row` weigh?
- Is the species of our `fixed-row` animal a `"dog"`?
- Could we use the `age` of our `male-row` as the size of a solid, green triangle?

@lesson-instruction{
We can use our knowledge of lookups, operators and functions to do just that!

- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{lookup-expressions.adoc}
}

@teacher{
Have students share their most creative uses of lookups. Did anyone use three or more columns from a Row? Did anyone use more than one Row in the same expression?
}

=== Synthesize
Once we know how to perform computations with a _single_ Row, we can use our knowledge of functions to generalize that computation to work with _every_ Row in a Table. This allows us to write some pretty powerful table functions that...

- Filter a table to show only animals older than 3
- Filter a table to show only animals whose species is `"dog"`
- Build a column that shows all the animals' weights in kilograms
- Build a column that represents the age of each animal as a solid, green triangle

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{Why would defining individual Rows be important, if our goal is to write table functions?}
@A{Writing examples requires sample values, and table functions need sample Rows}
}

@pd-slide{
Tables have tons of data - of all different types! - arranged into Rows and Columns. They feel like a monolith.

With lookups, we've given kids surgical precision to hone in on _an individual row_, and to hone in on an _individual value_ from that row. That might be kind of important if we want to do something like... *filter a table* showing only the individual rows where species equals dog.

Now we can use definitions to make our lives easier! If we find that we're writing the same thing over and over and over, we could just define `cat-row` instead of needing to retype all the lookup code every time.
