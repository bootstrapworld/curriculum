Just because data _can_ be used in a certain way doesn't mean it _should!_ Fortunately, this headline is NOT REAL. But there are many, many private things that companies can find out about us, simply by analyzing mountains of data that exist about us.

- Should police use social media to predict who is most likely to commit a crime?
- Should schools use prior grades to predict which students are most likely to fail?
- Should parents use their child's cell-phone location data to figure out where they go after school?

Doctors are bound by an ethical code, to prevent them from doing horrible experiments on people just to find a cure. Should data scientists have an ethical code as well?
