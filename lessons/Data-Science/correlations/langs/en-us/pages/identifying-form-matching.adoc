Match the description (left) with the scatter plot (right).

__Note: The computer won't tell us if the relationship we see in a scatter plot is linear, so it's important to train our eyes to decide this ourselves. For linear relationships, we should train our eyes to assess their direction and get a feel for their strength, so that we have a sense of whether the computed results make sense.__

@ifsoln{*TEACHERS: We have run linear regressions on these scatter plots to help you (the educators) to visualize the correlations better.  Students have NOT YET been introduced to lr-plots.*}
