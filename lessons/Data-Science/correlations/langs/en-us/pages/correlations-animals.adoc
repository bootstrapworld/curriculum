- *Form:* Does the point cloud appear linear or nonlinear? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{linear}}
- *Direction:* If it's linear, does it appear to go up or down as you move from left to right?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{up}}
- *Strength:* Is the point cloud tightly packed, or loosely dispersed?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{loosely dispersed}}
- Would you predict that the @math{r}-value is positive or negative? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{positive}}
- Will it be closer to zero, closer to ±1, or in between? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{+1}}

@n Is this correlation *stronger* or *weaker* than the correlation for `"pounds"`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Weaker.}}

@n What does that _mean_? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Weight is a better predictor for adoption time than age of the animal.}}
