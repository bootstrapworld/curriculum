| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- Students frequently confuse correlation for causation! It can be tempting for focus on the _computational_ element of the lesson alone, getting kids to think about R-value and identify patterns in data displays. But this ignores the critical point about correlation and causation, and students who over-focus on obtaining R-values are likely to develop this misconception!

== Correlations have _Form_ @duration{5 minutes}

=== Overview
Students identify and make use of patterns in scatter plots, learning to characterize them as appearing to be linear, curved, or showing no clear pattern. Determining that a @vocab{form} appears to be linear is a prerequisite for proceeding to @vocab{correlation} and @vocab{linear regression}.

@teacher{
Note: We can’t make any definitive assertions about correlations without computation, which students will learn about in our @lesson-link{linear-regression} lesson, but it doesn't make sense to search for correlations when there's no pattern at all, and summarizing with a correlation only makes sense for linear relationships, so it is important for students to develop an intuitive sense of what form means before engaging with the abstraction of computation.
}
=== Launch
We can analyze a single quantitative variable, such as `age` or `pounds` to identify a value that is *typical*, how much the values *vary*, and what kind of values are *usual or unusual*.

@teacher{(The bolded words above all deal with notions of what it means for a value to be "normal" or "abnormal". These words have loaded meaning in the context of variability, and should be used carefully!)}

But those analyses tell us nothing about the _relationship_ between animals' ages and weights. In order to understand such relationships, we have to expand our view from one column to two. This goes hand-in-hand with expanding our display from a 1-dimensional histogram or box plot to a 2-dimensional scatter plot.

@slidebreak

Rather than summarizing each distribution in one dimension, we can search for a _linear relationship_ between two quantitative variables. 

Linear relationships only make sense if the scatter plot follows a _straight-line pattern_, so the first thing we need to ask is whether the @vocab{form} of the relationship appears to be linear or not.

=== Investigate

Form indicates whether a relationship is linear, nonlinear or undefined@ifnotslide{:}@ifslide{.}

Some patterns are @vocab{linear}, and cluster around a straight line sloping up or down.

@ifslide{@image{images/1b1.gif, 250}}

@slidebreak

Some patterns are *nonlinear*, and may look like a curve, a hockey-stick, or some other shape!

@ifslide{@image{images/2NL.gif, 250}}

@slidebreak

And sometimes there is *no relationship* or pattern at all! That means there's no predictable change in the y-axis as we go from one side of the x-axis to the other.

Data Scientists use their eyes all the time! It doesn't make sense to search for correlations when there's no pattern at all, and summarizing with a correlation only makes sense for linear relationships! 

@strategy{Going Deeper}{


In an AP Statistics class or full-year Data Science class, it's appropriate to discuss nonlinear relationships here. In a dedicated computer science class, it may also be appropriate to talk about _transforming_ the x- or y-axis (using `build-column`!) via a quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic function and then looking for a linear pattern in the resulting scatter plot. All of these are *extensions* to the materials presented here.

== Correlations have _Direction_ @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Once students have learned to identify a possible linear relationship, they can turn their attention to other qualities of that relationship, like its @vocab{direction}.

=== Launch

We can also examine the direction of a linear relationship.

@ifnotslide{

|===
| @image{images/C.gif, 300}
| @image{images/A.gif, 300}
| Positive Direction
| Negative Direction
|===
}

A *positive* direction means that the line slopes up as we look from left-to-right. Positive relationships are by far most common because of natural tendencies for variables to increase in tandem. For example, “the older the animal, the more it tends to weigh”. This is usually true for human animals, too!

@ifslide{@image{images/C.gif, 300}}

@slidebreak

A *negative* direction means that the line slopes _down_ as we look from left-to-right. Negative relationships can also occur. For example, “the older a child gets, the fewer new words he or she learns each day.”

@ifslide{@image{images/A.gif, 300}}

@slidebreak

If the form is nonlinear or non-existent, "direction" doesn't apply: A parabola might look like it has both a positive _and_ negative correlation, and if there's no form at all then there certainly can't be a direction!

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
Complete @printable-exercise{identifying-form.adoc} and focus _just on the second question_, determining whether each of the possible linear relationships you previously identified appears to have a positive or negative correlation.

=== Synthesize
- It only makes sense to look for direction in linear relationships!
- Which data sets appear to have a positive correlation between the variables?

== Correlations have _Strength_ @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
We'll explore another quality of a possible linear relationship: its @vocab{strength}.

=== Launch

Strength indicates how closely the two variables are correlated.

*A relationship is strong if knowing the x-value of a data point gives us a very good idea of what its y-value will be* (knowing a student's age gives us a very good idea of what grade they're in). A strong linear relationship means that the points in the scatter plot are all clustered _tightly_ around an invisible line.

@ifslide{@image{images/A.gif, 300}}

@slidebreak

*A relationship is weak if x tells us little about y* (a student's age doesn't tell us much about their number of siblings). A weak linear relationship means that the cloud of points is scattered very _loosely_ around the line.

@ifslide{@image{images/1a.gif, 300}}

@slidebreak

We can ask ourselves, "How well does knowing the x-value allow us to predict what the y-value will be?"

@ifnotslide{
[.FillVerticalSpace, cols="^.^2a,^.^2a", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| @image{images/A.gif, 300}

| Weak Relationship
|===
}

If the form is non-existent, "strength" doesn't apply: without any form at all, there's nothing for data points to be tightly or loosely clustered around and predictions aren't possible!


=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
Complete @printable-exercise{identifying-form.adoc}, and focus on the third question for each scatter plot, identifying whether the relationship appears to be strong or weak.

@opt{If time permits, have students complete @opt-printable-exercise{identifying-form-matching.adoc} and/or the @opt-starter-file{correlations} card sort.}

=== Common Misconceptions
- Students often conflate strength and direction, thinking that a strong correlation _must_ be positive and a weak one _must_ be negative.
- Students may also falsely believe that there is ALWAYS a correlation between any two variables in their dataset.
- Students often believe that strength and sample size are interchangeable, leading to mistaken assumptions like "any correlation found in a million data points _must_ be strong!"

@QandA{
@Q{What has to be true about the _shape_ of a relationship in order to start talking about a correlation?}
@A{It must be linear}

@Q{What is the difference between a _weak_ relationship and a _negative_ relationship?} 
@A{A weak relationship is one in which knowing the x-value does not allow us to predict the y-value very well, and the points are not clustered tightly around a line whereas, if a relationship is negative, it means that one variable decreases as the other increases.}

@Q{What is the difference between a _strong_ relationship and a _positive_ relationship?}
@A{A strong relationship is one in which (1) knowing the x-value allows us to predict the y-value very well, and (2) the points are clustered tightly around a line, whereas if a relationship is positive, it means that the variables increase together.}

@Q{If we find a strong relationship in a sample from a larger population, will that relationship _always hold_ for the whole population? Why or why not?}
@A{No. Maybe the sample was biased, or maybe it was random but we *just happened* to choose points for which there is a correlation.}

@Q{If two correlations are both positive, is the stronger one _more positive_ (steeper slope) than the other}
@A{No. Direction and Strength are unrelated}

@Q{A news report claims that after surveying _10 million people_, a positive correlation was found between how much chocolate a person eats and how happy they are. Does this mean eating chocolate almost certainly makes you happier? Why or why not?}
@A{No. A correlation drawn from a giant sample can still be a weak correlation! Sample size is not connected to strength.}
}


== Summarizing Correlations using r-values @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Now that students know how to identify _direction_ and _strength_ for linear relationships, they'll learn to read how these are expressed in the @math{r}-value.

=== Launch
We have learned that a correlation can be described by three pieces of information: _Form_, _Direction_, and _Strength_. 

Statisticians and Data Scientists have a shorter way of describing all three, called @vocab{r-value}.

- @math{r} is positive or negative depending on whether the correlation is positive or negative. 
- The strength of a correlation is the distance from zero: 
  * an @math{r}-value of zero means there is no correlation at all
  * a perfect correlation would be either represented by −1 or 1

@slidebreak

Typically, @math{r}-values are categorized as follows:

- ±0.65 or ±0.70 or more is considered a strong correlation.
- ±0.35 to ±0.65 is “moderately correlated”. 
- less than ±0.25 or ±0.35 may be considered weak. 

These cutoffs are not an exact science, however! In some contexts an @math{r}-value of ±0.50 might be considered impressively strong!

@teacher{
If it works for you, give students five minutes to play a few rounds of the online game @link{http://guessthecorrelation.com/, Guess the Correlation} to develop intuition with r-values. (This will require creating an account.)
}

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{identifying-form-open-ended.adoc}. 
- For each scatter plot, identify whether the relationship appears to be linear, and, if so, use @math{r} to summarize direction and strength.
}

@slidebreak

Calculating @math{r} from a dataset only tells us the direction and strength of the relationship in _that particular sample_. If the correlation between adoption time and age for a representative sample of about 30 shelter animals turns out to be +0.44, the correlation for the larger population of animals will probably be _close_ to that, but certainly not the same.

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's look for correlations in the Animals Dataset!
- Open your saved Animals Starter File, or @starter-file{animals, make a new copy}.
- Complete @printable-exercise{correlations-animals.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/correlation-cartoon.jpg, 300}} It’s easy to be seduced by large @math{r}-values, and believe that we're really onto something that will help us claim that one variable really impacts another! But Data Scientists know better than that...

If time allows, you may want to emphasize the point that correlation does not imply causation by having students look at the nonsense claims that could be made from the graphs of real world data on the @link{http://tylervigen.com/, Spurious Correlations website}.
}

=== Common Misconceptions
Pay close attention to students' language when describing their correlations, and make sure they are not using causative wording!

Students often giggle at some of the Spurious Correlations examples, but fail to internalize the point when it comes to the Animals dataset or their own analysis. 

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Which corresponded more strongly with time to adoption, `"age"` or `"pounds"`?}
@Q{What does this _mean_?}
@A{The correlation with `"pounds"` is higher, meaning that an animal's weight is a better predictor of the number of weeks an animal will live at the shelter before being adopted than its age.}

@Q{People often confuse correlation with causation. What are some examples of this?}
@Q{Why is it a problem for society, that people confuse correlation and causation?}

== Exploration Project (Correlations) @duration{flexible}

=== Overview
Students apply what they have learned about correlations to their chosen dataset. They will add two or more items to their @starter-file{exploration-project}: (1) a correlation they think they see in the data set, and (2) the form, direction and strength of that correlation. 

@teacher{Visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration} to learn more about the sequence and scope. Teachers with time and interest can build on the exploration by inviting students to take a deep dive into the questions they develop with our @lesson-link{project-research-paper}.
}

=== Launch

Let’s review what we have learned about correlations.

@QandA{
@Q{What kind of displays can we use to visualize a correlation?}
@A{Scatter plots are used to visualize correlations.}

@Q{When Data Scientists describe correlations to one another, what three properties do they talk about, and what do they mean?}
@A{Form - describes the *shape* of a correlation. Correlations can be linear, nonlinear, or non existant (N/A).}
@A{Direction - linear correlations can be *positive* or *negative*, describing whether the point cloud seems to rise or fall as the explanatory variable gets larger.}
@A{Strength - describes how tightly the data is clustered around a line or curve.}
}

=== Investigate

Let’s connect what we know about correlations to your chosen dataset.

@teacher{Students have the opportunity to choose a dataset that interests them from our @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.adoc, "List of Datasets"} in the @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset} lesson.

}


@lesson-instruction{

- Turn to @printable-exercise{correlations-in-my-dataset.adoc}, and list three correlations you’d like to search for.
- Pick *one correlation* to explore. Which column do you think is the @vocab{explanatory variable}? The @vocab{response variable}?
- Make a scatter plot with the explanatory variable on the x-axis and the response variable on the y-axis.
- Do you see a correlation? What is its form? If it's linear, what is its direction and strength?
- Repeat this process for at least one more correlation.
}

@teacher{Confirm that all students have created and understand how to interpret their correlations. Once you are confident that all students have made adequate progress, invite them to access their @starter-file{exploration-project} from Google Drive.}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
*It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*

- Find the "Correlations I want to look into" section of the slide deck.
- For each correlation you wrote in @printable-exercise{correlations-in-my-dataset.adoc}, copy what you wrote into the slide.
- On the same slide, add your scatter plot and your description of the result.
- Repeat the process for each additional correlation you explored, making copies of the correlation slide as needed.
}

=== Synthesize

@teacher{Have students share their findings.}

- Did you discover anything surprising or interesting about your dataset?

- Were any of the correlations especially strong? Were any of them surprising?

- Were there any surprises when you compared your findings with other students? (For instance: Did everyone find a strong correlation? A linear one?)
