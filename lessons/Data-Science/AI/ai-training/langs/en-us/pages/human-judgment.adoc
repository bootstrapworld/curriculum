= The Importance of Human Judgment

Open the @starter-file{plagiarism}, click "Run", and then respond to the questions below.

== Determine Closeness

@n Use `cosine-similarity` to compare the student-submitted essay with the wikipedia article. Click "Run". What does the program tell you about the comparison? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`cosine-similarity(student-essay, wiki-article)` produces an output of ~0.97087...,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ indicating that the texts are extremely close.}}

@n Did you know that "pachyderm" is a synonym for "elephant"? In the student essay, replace all instances of "elephant" with "pachyderm". Try running the program again, to compare `student-essay` and `wiki-article`. What does the program tell you about the comparison?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`cosine-similarity(student-essay, wiki-article)` produces an output of ~0.7961..., meaning that the texts are still}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{close enough to raise suspicion.}}


== A Different Scenario

A teacher asks students to write an essay on one of three topics: modern art, soccer, or zebras. The teacher feeds the essays to a plagiarism detector to compare the essays to one another. It plots 32 points in a 1023-dimensional space.

@n What does the number 32 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher has provided the plagiarism detector with 32 student essays.}}

@n What does the number 1023 tell us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{In sum, the essays include 1023 different words.}}


== Assessing the Output

@vspace{1ex}

Consider each of the four outputs, below. What do you think is happening in each of scenarios? How would you advise the teacher?

@n The points are scattered seemingly randomly all over a 1023-dimensional space, with no apparent clustering.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The models for the documents are not close; students appear to have written essays with a range of different words that appear in}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{varying frequencies. The teacher should have no need to worry.}}

@n The points are scattered seemingly randomly, but there are two points plotted extremely close together.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{With the exception of two essays, students appear to have written essays with a range of different words that appear in varying frequencies. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher should focus on those two essays. Observe that the similarity is of the models, but the documents themselves may be quite different.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Therefore, the teacher should carefully examine the corresponding documents. If the documents are not similar, the closeness of the points}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{is probably a coincidence.}}


@n There appear to be three large, loose clusters of randomly plotted points.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{One likely explanation is that the three large, loose clusters represent the three different topics: modern art, zebras, and soccer. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students who write about one topic are likely to use similar terminology, and that terminology will differ by topic.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Since our three topics are extremely different, we should expect little overlap in specialized terminology between them}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{(although the “English”) parts will likely be quite similar). The teacher should have no need to worry.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n There appear to be two large, loose clusters of randomly plotted points, with one point positioned far away from the two clusters.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Perhaps one of the topics was far less popular than the others, and only one student opted to write about that topic.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The teacher should have no need to worry.}}
