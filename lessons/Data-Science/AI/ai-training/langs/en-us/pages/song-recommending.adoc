= Designing a Song Recommendation System


@n Think of a song that you know very well. Describe it in as much detail as you can. For starters, give: topic, musical genre, artist, and year of release. Then... have fun! How does the song make you feel? What instruments are used? In what language are the lyrics sung?

@n A song recommendation system must aggregate a user's listening history, extracting data that is useful for making predictions about the user's music preferences. What specific data will your song recommendation system store? You can consider both song characteristics and the user's listening patterns. Make a list below, and then rank each item based on how heavily you think it should be weighted in your song prediction function.
