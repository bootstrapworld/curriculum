= Building and Testing a Decision Tree

On @printable-exercise{level-1.adoc}, we decided that the decision mode at the end of the "teens" branch should be "interest in game". Let's create the rest of the tree and test it out. You can refer to the training dataset on @handout{decision-tree-data.adoc}.

== Build and Understand the Tree

@vspace{1ex}

Fill in the remainder of the tree using the algorithm you have learned (left) before filling in the blanks (right).

@n The root node of this tree is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{age}}.


@n The first set of branches includes @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{teens}}, @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{twenties}}, and @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{thirties}}.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Write the rules that this decision tree follows: @ifsoln{Answers will vary.}


a) Predict that @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{interested teens}} will buy the game.

@vspace{1ex}

b) Predict that *all* individuals in their twenties @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / will not} buy the game.

c) Predict that @fitb{15em}{@ifsoln{new customers in their thirties}} will not buy the game.

== Test the Tree

@vspace{1ex}

Let's see how well our decision tree predicts if Kat, Billy, or Chen will buy the game.

[cols="2,2,3,2,2", stripes="none", options="header"]
|===

| name 		| age 		| shopping history 	| interest in game 	| buys game
| Kat 		| teen 		| new customer		| yes 				| yes
| Billy		| twenties	| new customer		| no 				| no
| Chen	    | twenties 	| previous customer | no  				| no

|===

@n What prediction will the decision tree make for Kat? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{will buy}} Billy? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{will buy}} Chen? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{will buy}}

@n Compare the test data with the decision tree recommendations. How often was the computer correct? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1 out of 3 times}}

@n Based on this new test data, which rule (see Q3, above) needs to change? Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We need to change Rule b,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{that all individuals in their 20s will buy the game. The new test data contradicts the rule.}}

== Reflect

@n The decision tree we built was correct 100% of the time with our training dataset, but correct only 33% of with our test dataset. Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The training dataset is small, and only represents a sample of the population. The sample was not representative,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{as there are individuals in their twenties who choose not to purchase, among others who contradict the training data.}}

@n What could we do to improve the quality of this decision tree? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We would need to collect a bigger, more representative dataset,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and then build the tree again.}}
