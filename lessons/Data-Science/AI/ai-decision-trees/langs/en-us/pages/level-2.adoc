= Decision Tree: Level 2

[.linkInstructions]#Use the @handout{decision-tree-data.adoc, "training data"} to respond to the prompts below.# Let's decide what decision nodes to use in the 2nd level of our tree.

== Shopping History as the Decision Node

@n Using information from the "age" column and the "shopping history" column, fill in the blanks below.

@indented{a) The training data indicates that *previous customers in their teens* @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{will not}}{will / will not} buy the game.

b) The training data indicates that *new customers in their teens* probably @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / will not} buy the game.

@vspace{1ex}

c) What does the training data on *new customers in their teens* tell us? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The data does not provide any information on the likelihood of game purchase.}}
}


@n Rule: *Predict that frequent teenage shoppers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will not}}{will / will not} buy the game and that new teenage customers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / will not} buy the game.*

@n Will a computer following this rule make the correct prediction every time? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@n According to our training data, this rule is correct in @fitb{5m}{@ifsoln{four}} instances out of five.

@n Create a decision stump for "shopping history" with a root node of "teens". Place checkmarks below all correctly predicted values in the leaf node.

== Interest in Game as the Decision Node

@n Using information from the "age" column and the "interest in game" column, fill in the blanks below.

@indented{

a) The training data indicates that *interested teens*  @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / will not} buy the game.

b) The training data indicates *uninterested teens* probably @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / will not} buy the game.
}

@n Rule: *Predict that interested teenager shoppers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will}}{will / will not} buy the game and uninterested teenagers shoppers @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{will not}}{will / will not}.*

@n Will a computer following this rule make the correct prediction every time? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Yes!}}

@n Create a decision stump for teenagers' interest in the game.Place checkmarks below all correctly predicted values in the leaf node.
