= The First Spell Checker

The very first spell checker would use misspelled words as inputs.

- *First*, it would develop alternative candidates for the misspelled word (input) by making one of the following adjustments: (1) replace a single letter with a different one, or (2) swap the positions of two adjacent letters.

- *Next*, it would search the provided dictionary to see which alternatives were valid options.

- *Finally*, it would produce a list of valid correctly spelled words for the user to choose from.

== Part 1: Follow the Algorithm ("wello")

@n Generate alternative candidates for the misspelled word by replacing *one* letter with a different one. We’ve provided a first option to get you started. (Hint: these candidates don’t need to be real words!)

@fitb{8em}{cello} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{}



@n Generate alternative candidates for the misspelled word by swapping the positions of two *adjacent* letters. Again, we've provided a first option to get you started.

@fitb{8em}{ewllo} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{} @hspace{3em} @fitb{8em}{}

@n Are any of the candidates you listed above _actual_ words? If so, circle them. How many _plausible_ candidates did you find? @fitb{8em}{}

@n In question 1 above, there were only four blanks for you to fill in. About how many more *additional* candidates could you generate by replacing one letter? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A computer would generate over one hundred options. It would replace each of the letters in the word with all possible other}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{letters from the alphabet.}}



== Part 2: Reflect

@n What do you think are some limitations of this algorithm? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The algorithm would produce an extremely long list of possible candidates,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and many of the candidates would not be actual words. The human would need to spend lots of time sifting through options }

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{before making a decision. If more than one letter is incorrect, the spell checker will not propose the actual misspelled word!}}

@n How is the first spell checker's algorithm similar to whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The spell checker will }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{produce lots of words that rhyme and sound similar, which humans will likely naturally do. Humans may also deliberate between two}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{or more possible spellings.}}

@n How is the first spell checker's algorithm different from whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Human spell checking relies a lot on context, instinct, and previously acquired knowledge of word spellings.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The first spell checker did not use any of these tools that humans use.}}
