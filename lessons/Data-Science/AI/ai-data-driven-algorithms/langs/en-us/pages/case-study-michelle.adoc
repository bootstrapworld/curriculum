= Case Study: Michelle's Spotify Use

Michelle started using Spotify six months ago. The first time she checked out her AI-produced "Discover Weekly" playlist, she was underwhelmed. The songs did not seem to match her tastes, and she ended up skipping over many of them before even 30 seconds had passed. Michelle was so disappointed in that first experience that she gave up entirely on the "Discover Weekly" playlist, writing it off as a feature she did not care for.

After three months of using Spotify and listening to all of her favorite songs, artists, and playlists, Michelle happened to click on "Discover Weekly" again - but this time, she was delighted by what she heard. It felt as though her best friend had curated a playlist just for her. Michelle discovered new music that she had never heard before, that she absolutely loved.

As Michelle listened, she remarked, "Wow, Spotify has really improved their algorithms since I last checked out Discover Weekly."

@n What do you make of Michelleâ€™s statement? Circle your stance: @hspace{1em} _definitely correct_ @hspace{2em} _possibly correct_ @hspace{2em} _definitely incorrect_

@n Explain the reason(s) why her playlist is much better after three months of using Spotify. Provide as much detail as you can, using what you have discovered during this lesson. Hint: There may be more than one possible explanation!

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are several possible explanations for why Michelle thinks her playlist has improved.}}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It is possible that the algorithm has not changed at all. Spotify reviews listening history. In other words, it accesses which songs Michelle returns}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{to over and over, and which songs she skips. When we give _more data_, AI can produce better predictions. Maybe the AI is making predictions in }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{exactly the same way that it did six months ago.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Alternatively, it is possible that Spotify tweaked its algorithm. Spotify makes _minor_ changes to its algorithm regularly. Maybe the algorithm was}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{altered to put more weight on _other_ listeners' behaviors, and less weight on the user's listening behaviors, for instance.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It is possible that Spotify completely overhauled its algorithm! Perhaps the algorithm was entirely revised and rewritten. If this were the }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{case, users would likely heatedly discuss the impact of the changes!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{From an outside perspective, it is impossible to know why Michelle's recommendations have improved. In all possible scenarios (above),}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the most important variable was probably that Michelle listened to more music.}}


@n Michelle loves folk music featuring female vocals, but she has decided she wants to branch out. She is starting to feel frustrated by how Spotify keeps recommending folk music to her over and over and over! What is going on? How can Michelle start getting different recommendations?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Spotify cannot read Michelle's mind, nor will it guess that maybe today is the day that she wants try some new music that is out of her comfort zone. }}


@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Spotify can only process the data Michelle has provided, and make predictions based on that data. While there's a small chance that Spotify will }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{recommend hip hop music that is _influenced_ by folk music (especially if it features a female vocalist!), the best way to branch out}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{is ask a friend for recommendations... and listen to those recommendations, repeatedly. If Michelle spends enough time listening to folk music, Spotify}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ will eventually start generating different music recommendations.}}
