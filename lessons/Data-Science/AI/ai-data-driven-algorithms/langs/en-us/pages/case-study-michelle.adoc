= Case Study: Michelle's Spotify Use

Michelle started using Spotify six months ago. The first time she checked out her AI-produced "Discover Weekly" playlist, she was underwhelmed. The songs did not seem to match her tastes, and she ended up skipping over many of them before even 30 seconds had passed. Michelle was so disappointed in that first experience that she gave up entirely on the "Discover Weekly" playlist, writing it off as a feature she did not care for.

After three months of using Spotify and listening to all of her favorite songs, artists, and playlists, Michelle happened to click on "Discover Weekly" again - but this time, she was delighted by what she heard. It felt as though her best friend had curated a playlist just for her. Michelle discovered new music that she had never heard before, that she absolutely loved.

As Michelle listened, she remarked, "Wow, Spotify has really improved their algorithms since I last checked out Discover Weekly."

@n Michelleâ€™s statement is incorrect. In fact, the algorithms have remained exactly the same! Why is her playlist much better after three months of using Spotify? Provide as much detail as you can, using what you have discovered during this lesson.

@n Michelle loves hip hop, but she has decided she wants to branch out. She is starting to feel frustrated by how Spotify keeps recommending hip hop music to her, over and over and over! What is going on? How can Michelle start getting different recommendations?
