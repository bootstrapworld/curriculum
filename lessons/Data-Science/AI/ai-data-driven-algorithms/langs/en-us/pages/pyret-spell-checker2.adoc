= A Pyret Spell Checker: The Data

@link-instructions{Open the @starter-file{spell-checker} and click "Run".} Follow each of the instructions below how the spell checker is _data-driven_.

@n In the Interactions Area, test each of the three lines of code (below). Review the matches that Pyret produces, then record the _number_ of matches produced in the second row of the table.

@n The player of the partially-completed game that we reviewed wants some Pyret "assistance". Which three lines of code (above) would you encourage them to enter into Pyret? Why? @fitb{}{}

@n In question 1, we used the very same function (`go`) for each entry. The code didn't change! Why were the results different? (e.g., we received _more_ matches with `WORDS-ALL` than we did with `WORDS-100`) @fitb{}{}

@star Can you produce an input that matches more than one word in the @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XD726tuYLW_WQqbEdhKo22Xt3gJumQ6vfJ1PVMkwmYA/edit?usp=sharing, "third (100-word) dictionary"}? If so, what is it? @fitb{}{}

@star "W1" and "W2" represent two different five-letter words. If `go("W1", WORDS-ALL)` produces a list that includes "W2", will `go("W2", WORDS-ALL)` produce a list that includes "W1"? @fitb{}{}
