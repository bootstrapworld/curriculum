= A Pyret Spell Checker: The Algorithm

@link-instructions{Open the @starter-file{spell-checker} and click "Run".} Follow each of the instructions below to discover how our very own Pyret spell checker works.

@n In the @starter-file{spell-checker}, the function `go` consumes a string and a dictionary... but what does it produce? Test `go("pyret", WORDS-ALL)` in the Interactions Area. Record your results below.

@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{beret}} @hspace{2em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{egret}} @hspace{2em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{parer}} @hspace{2em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{puree}} @hspace{2em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{purer}}

@n Review the provided alternatives for "pyret". How many edits to the string ("pyret") does this algorithm make? (A single edit could entail replacing one letter with a different one, for instance.) Use an example to explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The algorithm makes up to two edits. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{For example, when "beret" is proposed as a match for "pyret", "py" becomes "be", but "ret" remains the same.}}

@n Test `go("cloaks", WORDS-ALL)` in the Interactions Area. Notice that "cloaks" has six letters, but all the suggested words have just five letters. What else can you conclude about the spell checker's algorithm? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{One of the edits can be the deletion of a letter.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The spell checker only proposes five-letter words.}}

@fitb{}{}

- To get from "cloaks" to "croak", delete @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{s}} and change @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{l}} to @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{r}}.

- To get from "cloaks" to "class", delete @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{o}} and change @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{k}} to @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{s}}.

- The spell checker makes just _one_ edit when it proposes @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{"croak"}} as a match for "cloak".

@n We have seen multiple two-edit changes. Use the `go` function in the @starter-file{spell-checker} on some strings and dictionaries of your choice. Does the program propose words that include three edits? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@n What is the maximum length string that this spell checker will accept? Why doesn't spell checker accept longer strings? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A 7-letter word would require two deletions, using both of the available edits.}}

@n Does this spell check program use the same algorithm as the @printable-exercise{first-spell-checker.adoc}? If not, what is different and how do you know? Which spell checker do you think is more effective? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. The first spell checker would only propose one adjustment, whereas the Pyret}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{spell checker proposes two. Pyret can delete letters, while the first spell checker could not. Pyret also only proposes 5-letter words,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{while the first spell checker did not have letter limit.}}
