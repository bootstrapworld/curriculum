== Spell Checkers as AI @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students think about spell checkers, considering how their programmed behavior is both similar to and different from the behavior of humans.


=== Launch


Over the past few years, you've probably heard some buzz about Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology that enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is behind ChatGPT, which appears able to develop video games, perform strongly on the SAT, even write a novel... and its capabilities are growing everyday.

Let's be real... the "buzz" about AI could probably more accurately be described as a non-stop deluge of information and misinformation. The conversation around AI is sometimes full of optimism and possibility, while at other times it is full of fear and dread.

Before we start learning about AI (How does it actually work? What's the connection to data science?), let's consider what sort of AI information we've absorbed just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
@Q{How do those books, movies, TV shows, and video games characterize AI?}
@Q{In your experience, is AI usually portrayed in a positive or negative light?}
}

@teacher{
As students discuss different representations of AI, pay attention to see if any themes emerge. Create a list on the board as the conversation evolves. Some possible themes are: robot turns on its creator; AI rebellion; robots usurp control; AI-controlled society; and simulated reality!
}

As it turns out, characterizations of AI featuring robot rebellion and the like envision technology that *does not currently exist*.  That said, there is plenty of AI that we interact with each and every day—and the futuristic dystopian AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the AI of the present.

The AI that we interact with—in fact the only type of AI that we have achieved—focuses on a single narrow task and has a limited range of abilities. Virtual assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa, to name a few) are one example. These apps respond to voice commands in order to perform simple tasks (setting alarms, making phone calls, and answering questions). Can you think of any others?


Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a term used to describe the technology that enables computers to perform tasks that were once thought to be for _humans only_.

There are a wide variety of tasks that fall in this domain - but for the sake of today's lesson, we will focus on a single and commonplace example: spell checking. Copy editing a document without the help of a spell checker would be laborious and error-prone. In fact, we are so used to receiving spell checking help that sometimes we don't even notice or acknowledge the way in which it happens automatically, without our acknowledgment.

But when it comes to spell checking, how does the performance of a computer compare to that of a human? Do humans and computers use similar spell checking strategies?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete Part 1 of @printable-exercise{human-spell-checking.adoc}.
- Be prepared to summarize the method that you used for spell checking:
** How do you locate misspelled words?
** How do you correct misspelled words?
}

You probably noticed that is was difficult to articulate how exactly you were able to locate and correct spelling mistakes. Why?

We are not computers! We rely on context clues and intuition. There were probably students in your class who said that the spelling mistakes jumped off the page. They couldn't *not* see the mistakes. Other students relied on context clues or prior knowledge to locate and fix errors. Of course, the process of spell-checking varies not just by person but by situation, too. If a different word had been misspelled, perhaps a multi-syllabic and complex technical word, you might have relied on a different spell checking strategy.

How can a computer possibly navigate such a nuanced and complex process?


=== Investigate

The very first spell checker was developed in 1961 at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It did not have mastery of the English language. Instead, its creators provided the spell checker program with a 10,000-word dictionary and a precise algorithm to follow. Here is what the algorithm entailed:

[.indentedpara]
--
- *First*, it would develop alternative candidates for the misspelled word (input) by making one of the following adjustments: (1) replace a single letter with a different one, or (2) swap the positions of two adjacent letters.

- *Next*, it would search the provided dictionary to see which alternatives were valid options.

- *Finally*, it would produce a list of valid correctly spelled words for the user to choose from.
--

Unsurprisingly, spell checkers have evolved a lot since 1961 - but exploring this particular algorithm can offer us interesting insights about one of the earliest forms of AI.

@lesson-instruction{
- In Part 1 of @printable-exercise{first-spell-checker.adoc}, __you__ will be the computer, following the spell checking algorithm developed at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1961.
- Once you've completed Part 1, move on to Part 2, where you will reflect on the activity.
}

@teacher{
After students have completed the activity, invite them to share their responses to the four reflection questions (below) in small groups.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you think are some limitations of the first spell checker's algorithm?}
@Q{What are some of the advantages of this algorithm?}
@Q{How is the first spell checker's algorithm similar to whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing?}
@Q{How is the first spell checker's algorithm different from whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing?}
}

As you discovered during @printable-exercise{human-spell-checking.adoc}, when *you* spell check, you rely on intuition, instinct, and context clues. When AI spell checks, on the other hand, it relies on computational brute force: even the most primitive spell checking program will repeatedly edit the misspelled word, generating dozens of different letter combinations to verify in the dictionary. The computer works quickly - but the work that it completes would be time-consuming and laborious for a human.

== Spell Checking in Pyret @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

=== Launch

By now, we have a decent sense of the extensive work that is happening behind the scenes when we spell check our writing. We have *not*, however, discussed an essential truth about spell checkers and in fact *all Artificial Intelligence*: it is "data driven".

@QandA{
@Q{Where have you encountered the term "data driven" before, if at all?}
@Q{Have you ever met anyone who is "data driven"? (Teachers? Coaches? Parents?)}
@Q{What do you think it means to be "data driven"?}
}




=== Investigate


@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{pyret-spell-checker.adoc} using the @starter-file{spell-checker}.
- If you finish early, try the two challenge problems at the bottom of the page!
}

When we offered _more data_ to our rudimentary Pyret spell checker, we got better results _without changing the code_.

Data is at the heart of data science, and _data-driven_ algorithms are at the heart of AI. This statement is true not just of spell checkers, but of all artificial intelligence.

@lesson-instruction{
- Consider a different scenario, @printable-exercise{case-study-michelle.adoc}.
- Read the brief story and respond to the question, providing as much detail as you can.
}

@teacher{Invite students to share their responses, emphasizing that data-driven algorithms produce a higher quality output when we provide more data. Changing the code is not needed. When change to the code _does_ happen, it is done by humans.}

@scrub{NOTING THAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE EXAMPLE BELOW IN AI DATA DRIVEN ALGORITHMS' CASE STUDY MICHELLE}

To consider one example, let's discuss song and video recommendation by apps such as YouTube and Spotify.

@QandA{

@Q{Has Spotify or YouTube ever recommended you a new song or video that you enjoyed? Has it ever recommended you something that you _didn't_ enjoy? Elaborate.}
@A{Answers will vary. Allow students to share their personal experiences.}

@Q{How and why do you think recommendation algorithms seem to "know" what content you will like?}
@A{Allow students to share their responses. Some possible responses include: it reviews my viewing / listening history; it has access to the content I have skipped; it sees which videos and songs I return to over and over.}

@Q{Why do you think the songs and videos recommended are sometimes _not_ what you were hoping to discover?}
@A{Our tastes are not always entirely predictable. Just because a listener enjoys _some_ upbeat pop music with a female vocalist does not indicate that they will enjoy _all_ upbeat pop music with a female vocalist.}

}

Hopefully, our conversation about automatic song and video recommendation got you thinking about how computers need to be _trained_ on data for machine learning to happen.

In the case of song and video recommendation, Spotify and YouTube's algorithms process all the available data about your listening/viewing preferences. Let's say, however, that you have a history of listening to folk music... but a desire to branch out and explore some hip hop. Spotify cannot read your mind, nor will it guess that maybe today is the day you try some new music that is out of your comfort zone; it can only process the data you've provided it, and build a predictive model based on that data. While there's a small chance that Spotify will recommended hip hop music that is _influenced_ by folk music (especially if it features a female vocalist!). If you *really* want to branch out, ask a friend for a recommendation... and listen to it. If you spend enough time listening to hip hop, Spotify will eventually start generating hip hop recommendations.

@lesson-point{
Machine learning is driven by data. More data results in more accurate task completion.
}

The type of data that we use to train artificial intelligence varies by situation.
