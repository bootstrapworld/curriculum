== The First Spell Checker: Intelligent or Not? @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students consider one specific example of machine learning, evaluating how spell checkers' programmed behaviors are both similar to and different from the behaviors of humans.


=== Launch

Copy editing a document without the help of a spell checker would be laborious and error-prone. We are so used to receiving spell checking help that sometimes we don't even notice or acknowledge the way in which it happens automatically. But the spell checker built into your web browser or word processing system is a classic example of machine learning.

Artificial intelligence--as opposed to machine learning--is when computers perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Is spell checking such a task? When it comes to spell checking, how does the performance of a computer compare to that of a human? Do humans and computers use similar spell checking strategies?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{human-spell-checking.adoc}.
- Be prepared to summarize the method that you used for spell checking:
** How do you locate misspelled words?
** How do you correct misspelled words?
}

You probably noticed that is was difficult to articulate how exactly you were able to locate and correct spelling mistakes. Why?

We are not computers! We rely on context clues and intuition. There were probably students in your class who said that the spelling mistakes jumped off the page. They couldn't *not* see the mistakes. Other students relied on context clues or prior knowledge to locate and fix errors. Of course, the process of spell-checking varies not just by person but by situation, too. If a different word had been misspelled, perhaps a multi-syllabic and complex technical word, you might have relied on a different spell checking strategy.


=== Investigate


The very first spell checker was developed in 1961 at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Its creators provided the spell checker program with a 10,000-word dictionary and a precise algorithm to follow. Here is what the algorithm did:

[.indentedpara]
--
- *First*, it would develop alternative candidates for the misspelled word (input) by making one of the following adjustments: (1) replace a single letter with a different one, or (2) swap the positions of two adjacent letters.

- *Next*, it would search the provided dictionary to see which alternatives were valid options.

- *Finally*, it would produce a list of valid correctly spelled words for the user to choose from.
--

Unsurprisingly, spell checkers have evolved a lot since 1961â€”but exploring this particular algorithm can offer us interesting insights about one of the earliest forms of AI/ML.

@lesson-instruction{
- In Part 1 of @printable-exercise{first-spell-checker.adoc}, __you__ will be the computer, following the spell checking algorithm developed at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1961.
- Reflect on the activity in Part 2.
}

@teacher{
After students have completed the activity, invite them to share their responses to the four reflection questions (below) in small groups.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you think are some limitations of the first spell checker's algorithm?}
@A{The algorithm would produce an extremely long list of possible candidates, and many of the candidates would not be actual words. The human would need to spend lots of time sifting through options before making a decision. If _more_ than one letter in a word is incorrect, the spell checker has no chance of proposing the correct word.}

@Q{How is the first spell checker's algorithm similar to whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing?}
@A{The spell checker will produce lots of words that rhyme and sound similar, which humans will likely naturally do. Humans may also deliberate between multiple spellings, which this spell checker invites us to do.}


@Q{How is the first spell checker's algorithm different from whatever strategy *you* use when spell checking your writing?}
@A{Human spell checking relies a lot on context, instinct, and previously acquired knowledge of spelling. The first spell checker did not use any of these tools that humans use.}

}


=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{In what ways do spell checkers succeed at mimicking humans?}
@A{Based on the above, they do not at all!}

@Q{Would it be a good idea for a human to try mimic a spell checker's algorithm? Why or why not?}

@A{The program we just discussed relies on computational brute force: primitive spell checking programs will repeatedly edit / transform a misspelled word, generating dozens of different words to verify in the dictionary. Were a human to undergo this process, it would be time-consuming, laborious, and totally irrational... therefore highly error prone.}

== Spell Checking in Pyret @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students explore both the algorithm and the datasets that power a Pyret-based spell checker, discovering that data-driven algorithms are at the heart of AI.

=== Launch

By now, we have a decent sense of the extensive work that is happening behind the scenes when we spell check our writing. We have *not*, however, discussed an essential truth about spell checkers and in fact *all modern Artificial Intelligence*: it is "data driven".

@QandA{
@Q{Where have you encountered the term "data driven" before, if at all?}
@A{Sample responses: data-driven *decision making* is informed by collecting or analyzing data; data-driven *health care* involves using data to think about the effectiveness of different treatments; a data-driven *teacher* will reteach topics that students struggled with.}

@Q{Have you ever met anyone who is "data driven"? (Teachers? Coaches? Parents?) Explain.}

@Q{What do you think it means to be "data driven"?}
@A{Responses will vary, but should highlight the general idea that data informs how things are done.}
}

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{spell-checker} and click "Run".
- Complete @printable-exercise{pyret-spell-checker.adoc} to discover how one spell checker works.
}

As you were interacting with the @starter-file{spell-checker}, you observed that it only proposed five-letter words. This is because the dictionary it draws from is actually a Wordle dictionary!

@teacher{Are you familiar with Wordle? If not, you can quickly learn the rules and play it @link{https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html, "here"}. Before moving on with the lesson, be sure to check for students' familiarity with the game via a show of hands. If your students have _not_ played Wordle before, play one round as a class before proceeding.}

@left{@image{images/wordle.png, 175}}


Let's consider a partially-played Wordle game (left).


The player has attempted three words so far: "WORTH", "MEDIA", and "GAMES". With each turn, we have learned something new. At this point, we know that _a_, _m_, and _e_ belong in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tiles, respectively. We know that the 1st and 5th tiles are _not_ occupied by _w_, _o_, _r_, _t_, _h_, _d_, _i_, _g_, or _s_.

The player has just three turns left!

@QandA{
@Q{What word would _you_ try next?}
@A{Responses will vary; keep a list of student proposals.}

@Q{Each of the words you proposed was probably 2 edits away from "GAMES", the user's third guess. Why?}
@A{Three of the letters are correct; we just need to substitute in different letters for _g_ and _s_.}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{pyret-spell-checker2.adoc} using the @starter-file{spell-checker}.
- If you finish early, try the two challenges at the bottom of the page.
}

When we offered _more data_ to our rudimentary Pyret spell checker, we got better results _without changing the code_.

Data is at the heart of data science, and @vocab{data-driven algorithms} are at the heart of AI. This statement is true not just of spell checkers, but of all artificial intelligence.

The type of data that we use to train artificial intelligence varies by situation, of course.

@lesson-instruction{
- Consider a different scenario, @printable-exercise{case-study-michelle.adoc}.
- Read the brief story and respond to the question, providing as much detail as you can.
}

@teacher{Invite students to share their responses, emphasizing that data-driven algorithms produce a higher quality output when we provide more data. Changing the code is not necessarily needed. When change to the code _does_ happen, it is done by humans.}

=== Synthesize

@Q{This lesson--and several others on related AI / ML topics--is part of a broader *data science* course. Why are AI and ML considered sub-disciplines of data science?}

@A{Data science, AI and ML all rely on *data*! Data science is the process of learning from data. AI and ML involve building predictive models _based on data_.}
