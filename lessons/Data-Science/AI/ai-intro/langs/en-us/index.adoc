== What do you know about AI? @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students think broadly about artificial intelligence and compare it to machine learning.

=== Launch

You've probably heard some buzz about Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology that enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is behind ChatGPT, which appears able to develop video games, perform strongly on the SAT, even write a novel... and its capabilities are growing everyday.

Let's be real: the "buzz" about AI could probably more accurately be described as a non-stop deluge of information and misinformation. Before we start learning about AI (How does it actually work? What's the connection to data science?), let's consider what sort of AI information we've absorbed just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
@Q{How do those books, movies, TV shows, and video games characterize AI?}
@Q{In your experience, is AI usually portrayed in a positive or negative light?}
}

@teacher{
As students discuss different representations of AI, pay attention to see if any themes emerge. Create a running list on the board. Some possible themes are: robot turns on its creator; AI rebellion; robots usurp control; AI-controlled society; and simulated reality!
}


=== Investigate


The conversation around AI is often philosophical: to understand what sort of tasks require human intelligence, we must consider _what it means to be human_. That's a pretty broad topic, one which is informed by worldview and personal beliefs. We are *not* going to dig think about what it means to be human during this series of lesson!

Instead, we are going to think about *machine learning*, a specific branch of AI. Machine learning is concrete: there's no ambiguity involved, no need for philosophizing. *Machine learning is just a collection of algorithms!* We use these algorithms and statistical models to teach machines how to perform tasks by processing data and identifying patterns.

Machine learning, concrete as it may be, is at the heart of AI--so much so that many computer scientists prefer to use the phrase "AI/ML" when discussing the sort of technology that increasingly pervades our world.

Many characterizations of AI envision technology that *does not currently exist*. That said, there is plenty of AI/ML that we interact with everyday. The futuristic dystopian AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the AI of the present.

The AI that we interact with focuses on a single narrow task and has a limited range of abilities. Virtual assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa, to name a few) are one example. These apps respond to voice commands in order to perform simple tasks (setting alarms, making phone calls, and answering questions).

Can you think of any others?

@QandA{
@Q{What forms of AI appear in your life on a day-to-day basis?}
@A{Possible responses: TikTokâ€™s algorithm, text prediction, chess playing computers, grammar correcting apps.}
@Q{What is the most impressive AI you have encountered in your daily life?}
@A{Allow students to share. }

@strategy{Is it AI?}{

_Are search engines AI?_

Although some search engines (especially as of 2024) incorporate AI-generated summaries of content, we generally do *not* think of the search engine as a form of AI.

That said, this question--AI or not?--is rarely easy to answer!

_What about grammar correcting apps?_

Sure, grammar correction is an act that typically involves human intelligence, but if a grammar corrector _actually_ mimicked human behavior, we would probably steer clear of it. It would be too unreliable.

This lesson does *not* include an activity where students classify different technologies into "AI" or "Not AI", because the distinction is too blurry.

Do grammar correcting apps use machine learning? Yes! How about search engines? Yes again!

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@A{How are AI and ML alike? How are they different?}
@Q{What are some questions that you have about AI/ML? What are you hoping to learn?}
@Q{What _confuses_ you about AI/ML?}
}

@teacher{Consider writing down students' questions and possible misconceptions about AI. You can revisit these questions as  answers emerge in subsequent lessons.}
