== What do you know about AI? @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students think broadly about artificial intelligence before considering one specific example of AI: the spell checker.

=== Launch

You've probably heard some buzz about Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology that enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is behind ChatGPT, which appears able to develop video games, perform strongly on the SAT, even write a novel... and its capabilities are growing everyday.

Let's be real: the "buzz" about AI could probably more accurately be described as a non-stop deluge of information and misinformation. Before we start learning about AI (How does it actually work? What's the connection to data science?), let's consider what sort of AI information we've absorbed just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
@Q{How do those books, movies, TV shows, and video games characterize AI?}
@Q{In your experience, is AI usually portrayed in a positive or negative light?}
}

@teacher{
As students discuss different representations of AI, pay attention to see if any themes emerge. Create a running list on the board. Some possible themes are: robot turns on its creator; AI rebellion; robots usurp control; AI-controlled society; and simulated reality!
}

Many characterizations of AI envision technology that *does not currently exist*.  That said, there is plenty of AI that we interact with everyday. The futuristic dystopian AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the AI of the present.

=== Investigate

The AI that we interact with—in fact the only type of AI that we have achieved—focuses on a single narrow task and has a limited range of abilities. Virtual assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa, to name a few) are one example. These apps respond to voice commands in order to perform simple tasks (setting alarms, making phone calls, and answering questions). Can you think of any others?

@QandA{
@Q{What forms of AI appear in your life on a day-to-day basis?}
@A{Possible responses: TikTok’s algorithm, GPS, text prediction, chess playing computers, grammar correcting apps.}
@Q{What is the most impressive AI you have encountered in your daily life?}
@A{Allow students to share. }
}

@strategy{Are Search Engines AI?}{

Although some search engines (especially as of 2024) incorporate AI-generated summaries of content, we generally do *not* think of the search engine as a form of AI. A standard search engine combs the web and organizes the information into an index of links. The program does not generate text, images, code, or content.
}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{What are some questions that you have about AI? What are you hoping to learn?}
@Q{What _confuses_ you about AI?}
}

@teacher{Consider writing down students' questions and possible misconceptions about AI. You can revisit these questions as  answers emerge in subsequent lessons.}
