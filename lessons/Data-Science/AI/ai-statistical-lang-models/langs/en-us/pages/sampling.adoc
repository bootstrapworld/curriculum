== Text Generation Exercise #2

@n Let's choose our first word. Below is a list of the most common unigrams in the corpus. We'll start by choosing the *most* common word. Write that word on the line below.


- "the": 15 times
- "a": 13 times
- "she": 11 times


@n What word most likely follows “the”? _Refer to Q10 on @printable-exercise{constructing-model.adoc} to find out._ Enter that word on the second blank space, below.

@n How many times does "That" follow "spider"? @fitb{5em}{} How many times does "to" follow "spider"? @fitb{5em}{}

@n There is an equal probability of choosing "to" and "that"! Flip a coin or use some other method of random selection to decide between them. Write your chosen word on the third line, below.

@n Use statistical language modeling to determine the fourth word in the phrase; record it on the final blank.

@fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{The}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{spider}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{to / that}} @hspace{1em} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{catch / wriggled}}
