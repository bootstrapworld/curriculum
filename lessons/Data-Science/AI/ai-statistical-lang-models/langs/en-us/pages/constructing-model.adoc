Use @handout{old-lady-lyrics.adoc} to answer the questions, below. *Note that the title of the song is a part of the corpus!*

== Did she swallow a fly?

@n Let's say we want to know the likelihood that the old lady "swallowed a fly". We need a ratio!

@vspace{1ex}


@math{p(fly | swallowed a) =}
@math{\frac
	{\textit{count(swallowed a fly)}}
	{\textit{count(swallowed a...)}}
= {\frac{}{10}}}


@n The likelihood that the old lady "swallowed a fly" in the excerpt is @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{60%}}.

== What about the other animals?

@vspace{1ex}

@n
@math{p(spider | swallowed a) =}
@math{\frac
	{\textit{count(swallowed a spider)}}
	{\textit{count(swallowed a...)}}
= {\frac{}{10}}}

@n
@math{p(bird | swallowed a) =}
@math{\frac
	{\textit{count(swallowed a bird)}}
	{\textit{count(swallowed a...)}}
= {\frac{}{10}}}

@n
@math{p(cat | swallowed a) =}
@math{\frac
	{\textit{count(swallowed a cat)}}
	{\textit{count(swallowed a...)}}
= {\frac{}{10}}}


@n Across the entire poem, the lady _most likely_ swallowed a @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{fly}}. The second most likely option is that she swallowed a @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{cat}}. There is an equal probability that she swallowed a @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{spider}} or a @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{bird}}.


== To catch the... ?

@vspace{1ex}

@n
@math{p(fly | to catch the) =}
@math{\frac
	{\textit{count(to catch the fly)}}
	{\textit{count(to catch the...)}}
= {\frac{}{6}}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n
@math{p(spider | to catch the) =}
@math{\frac
	{\textit{count(to catch the spider)}}
	{\textit{count(to catch the...)}}
= {\frac{}{6}}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n
@math{p(bird | to catch the) =}
@math{\frac
	{\textit{count(to catch the bird)}}
	{\textit{count(to catch the...)}}
= {\frac{}{6}}}

@vspace{1ex}

The lady was most likely trying to catch the @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{fly}}. It is the least likely that she was trying to catch the @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{bird}}.

== Try it on your own and reflect

@n What is likelihood that each of the following words follows *"the"*? "fly": @fitb{1em}{}, "spider": @fitb{1em}{}, "bird": @fitb{1em}{}, "cat": @fitb{1em}{}.

_If needed, use a separate paper to show your work._

@ifsoln{
fly = @math{\frac{3}{12}}, spider = @math{\frac{5}{12}}, bird = @math{\frac{3}{12}}, cat = @math{\frac{1}{12}}
}
