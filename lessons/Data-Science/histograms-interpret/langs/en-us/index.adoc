== Interpreting Shape

@objective{histogram-shape}

=== Overview

Students consider what different distributions tell us about a dataset, connecting different scenarios with different data visualizations.

=== Launch

We now have the terminology needed to describe histogram shape. But what can we actually conclude about a dataset based on a histogram's shape?

@lesson-instruction{

Let's consider two different scenarios:

- The average US woman gives birth around age 26, but some do even after 45! Children do not give birth.

- Most adults have close to a full set of 32 teeth, but a few hockey players might have a very small number of teeth. No one has more than 32 teeth.

*Let's draw a rough sketch of what we think the histogram for each of these scenarios might look like.*}

@teacher{
Invite a student to the board to draw a rough sketch of each scenario. Invite the students to describe how they decided where to draw the clusters, peaks, and outliers.}

@QandA{
@Q{Which of the above scenarios describes a left skew? Explain.}
@A{The scenario about women's ages describes a left skew. Most of the data is clustered around 26, but there is also data further on the right, all the way up to 45. There is no data around, say, age 7.}

@Q{Which of the above scenarios describes a right skew? Explain.}
@A{The scenario about teeth describes a right skew. Most of the data is clustered around 32 with a few outliers further to the left.}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{use-shape-to-interpret.adoc}.
- Just like we did during the warm up, you will sketch rough histograms, make a decision their shape, and then interpret the data.
}

=== Investigate

@teacher{

There is some setup required for the interactive activity that follows.

- You will need flip chart paper, tape, and markers.
- Divide your class into teams of three. All around your classroom, tape flip chart paper to the wall--one poster per team of three students.
- On each piece of flip chart paper, write "Skew Left", "Skew Right", or "Symmetric", and then draw lines to divide the paper horizontally into three equal sections.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Your teacher has instructed you and your group to stand in front of a blank poster that says "Symmetric", "Skew Left", or "Skew Right" at the top.
- The paper is divided into three horizontal sections. In the top section of your paper, draw a histogram that matches the shape assigned to you.
}

@teacher{Once all students have drawn their histograms, direct them to rotate to the next poster with a different shape.}

@lesson-instruction{
- You are now standing in front of a poster that identifies a shape and also includes a histogram of that shape.
- In the second horizontal section of the poster, write a scenario or describe a dataset that would result in that distribution.
- Leave the third section of the poster blank. We will use it another day!
- Take a few minutes to walk around the classroom and read the scenarios your peers developed. Return to your seat when you have had a chance to see all of the posters.
}

@teacher{
Spend some time debriefing with students, using the prompts below. Responses will vary for each group of students.
}

@QandA{
@Q{Did all of the scenarios your classmates developed correctly represent the given shape?}

@Q{Did you notice any especially creative scenarios? Any surprising scenarios?}

@Q{Were there any scenarios that were represented more than once? Why do you think those scenarios were popular?}
}

@teacher{
The third section of the posters will remain blank today. Students will complete this section in the future when they learn about @lesson-link{box-plots}.
}


@lesson-instruction{
Try it on your own! Complete @printable-exercise{reading-histograms-matching.adoc}, where you will match descriptions of video ratings to histograms that could fit the data.
}

@teacher{Go over correct responses as a class.}


=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{What strategies did your group use in brainstorming scenarios to match histogram shape?}
@Q{For which distributions was it easiest to come up with an example?}
@Q{For which distributions was it hardest to come up with an example?}

== Histograms and Measures of Center

@objective{histograms-and-measures-of-center}

=== Overview

Students combine apply their knowledge histograms, measures of center, and shape.

=== Launch

Can you compute and interpret different measures of center from a histogram? Let's try it.

@QandA{
The histogram below shows the number of children per home in the Broadmoor neighborhood.

@image{images/number-children.png, 350}

@Q{What is the median number of children per home?}
@A{The median is 1. Students may mistakenly attempt to find the midpoint of the values on the horizontal axis, indicating that they connect median with “middle”, but misunderstand _what_ middle value to find. In this case, all of the raw data is available in the histogram.
}

@Q{What is the mean number of children per home?}
@A{Approximately 2.04. Note that students may attempt to use the “add up and divide” algorithm with inappropriate data values from the display. Students may mistakenly compute the mean height of the bars, or the mean of values on the horizontal axis.}
}

@teacher{Students often cannot compute measures of center from histograms because they _lack attention to the context of the data_. Cooper and Shore (2008) suggest that when students are confused, simply ask "What are the data?" to help reorient and redirect students. Similarly, urge students to discuss and defend their responses.}


=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Work with a partner to complete @printable-exercise{histograms-moc.adoc}.
- Which problem was the most challenging? Why did you find it challenging?
}

@teacher{
Discuss solutions with students. Highlight for students the misconceptions revealed by common incorrect responses. For instance, choosing "the modes are roughly the same" for the the first problem suggests that students understand the concept of mode, but looked at bar height (indicating frequency) instead of considering the value on the x-axis.
}



=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{How was interpreting mean, median, and mode from a histogram different than computing it from a raw dataset?}
@A{Responses will vary. Students should explain that they needed to understand the meaning of the bar height and the values on the x-axis in order to arrive at correct measures of center.}

@Q{Describe how the relationship between mean and median can help you draw a conclusion about the skewness of a histogram. (_For example: When the mean is greater than the median, I know that..._)}
@A{When the mean is greater than the median, outliers on the right cause the display to be skewed right. When the mean is less than the median, outliers on the left cause the histogram to be skewed left. }
}





== Histograms and Variability

=== Overview

Students consider variability as deviation from the mean, and then assess the variability of histograms.

=== Launch

@QandA{

We've made lots of different data visualizations for the animals in the shelter.

@Q{Can you predict what the histogram look like if every animal in the shelter had approximately the same weight?}
@A{The histogram would have one bar that was very tall, which would include *all* of the animals.}

@Q{Does the histogram you described represent a dataset of _high_ or _low_ variability?}
@A{The histogram has _low_ variability: the range is small, and each of the data points are similar to one another.}
}

So far, we have defined variability in two ways so far:

- unlikeability (categorical data)
- range (quantitative data)

In this lesson, we will build onto our definition of variability. Variability is also *deviation from the mean*. If all the animals have roughly the same age, we can conclude that there will be extremely little variation from the mean. A large spread and the presence of outliers result in greater variation from the mean.

@QandA{

@Q{Which dataset below has the *least* variability from its mean? Explain.}
@A{Histogram A varies the least from its mean. The mean of the data is also the mode, and outliers are evenly distributed on both sides.}

}

@teacher{
Invite a variety of students to share and explain their responses. Students commonly believe that a flatter histogram equates to less variability in the data than a bumpy histogram (@citation{kaplan-et-al-2014}). In other words, when reporting on variability, students mistakenly focus on frequency (y-axis) rather than data values (x-axis).
}


@lesson-instruction{
- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{histogram-variability.adoc}.
- Provide an explanation for each response that you give. Be prepared to share your answers with the class.
}

@teacher{
@printable-exercise{histogram-variability.adoc} includes three challenging questions. If students are struggling, encourage them to imagine the dot plot data visualization of each histogram. Oftentimes, thinking about individual datapoints can support students strengthening their reasoning.
}


=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Many students equate variability with range. How can we determine which of two histograms shows greater variability if the two histograms have the same range?}

@A{We can think of variability as deviation from the mean. Once we have located the mean of a histogram, we can consider if data points are more likely to fall near or far from the mean.}
}



== Data Exploration Project (Visualizing Shape) @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students apply what they have learned about visualizing shape to the histograms they have created for their chosen dataset. They will add to their @starter-file{exploration-project} a more detailed interpretation of their histograms using new vocabulary. 

@teacher{Visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration} to learn more about the sequence and scope. Teachers with time and interest can build on the exploration by inviting students to take a deep dive into the questions they develop with our @lesson-link{project-research-paper}.
}

=== Launch

Let’s review what we have learned about visualizing the shape of data.

@QandA{
@Q{Describe a histogram that is _skewed right_. Are its outliers high or low?}
@A{Values are clumped around what's typical, with low outliers.}

@Q{Describe a histogram that is _skewed left_. Are its outliers high or low?}
@A{Values are clumped around what's typical, with high outliers.}

@Q{Describe a histogram that is symmetric.}
@A{It’s just as likely for the variable to take a value a certain distance below the middle as it is to take a value that same distance above the middle.}
}

=== Investigate

Let’s connect what we know about visualizing the shape of the data to the histograms we created for your chosen dataset.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your chosen dataset starter file in @proglang.
- For this analysis, you'll want to look at the Data Cycle that you completed during the Histograms lesson.
- Recreate the histograms that you made before. Now, edit and expand your discussion so that it uses the new vocabulary that you've used.
}

@teacher{@opt{If your students who need a fresh copy of the Data Cycle template, distribute @opt-printable-exercise{data-cycle-quantitative.adoc}.}}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
*It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*

- For each of the histograms that you have added, edit and / or expand upon the interpretations you provided during the Histograms lesson.
- Be sure to integrate the new vocabulary we have learned, including: @vocab{shape}, @vocab{skewed left}, @vocab{skewed right}, and @vocab{symmetric}.
- Describe what this shape tells you about the quantitative column you chose.
}

=== Synthesize

@teacher{Have students share their findings.}

- What @vocab{shape}s did you notice in your histograms?
- Did you discover anything surprising or interesting about your dataset?
- Were there any surprises when you compared your findings with other students?
