Read each scenario. Draw a *rough* histogram sketch (you do not need to label the axes), then decide if the histogram is skew left, skew right, or symmetric. Explain your interpretation.

@n In the United States, there are a few billionaires that have far greater incomes than the average (about $28,000).

| *Circle one:* @hspace{2em} _skew left @hspace{4em} @ifsoln-choice{skew right} @hspace{4em} symmetric_

Explain your choice: @fitb{}{Most Americans make under 250k/yr, but there are extreme outliers like Elon}

@fitb{}{Musk pulling the data to the right, and no one is earning "negative 10}

@fitb{}{billion dollars" to balance out his data}

@n A school cafeteria mostly buys canned goods in huge sizes (48-64 ounces), but also purchases a few ingredients in smaller sizes (4-8 ounces).

| *Circle one:* @hspace{2em} _@ifsoln-choice{skew left} @hspace{4em} skew right @hspace{4em} symmetric_

Explain your choice: @fitb{}{Most of the data will be clustered on the right side (larger sizes), with a few outliers}

@fitb{}{on the left (smaller sizes).}

@n It's just as likely for a newborn baby to be a certain number of ounces below the average weight (approximately 7.5 pounds) as it is to be that number of ounces above the average weight.

Explain your choice: @fitb{}{If it's equally likely to be above and below the average, the data will be}

@fitb{}{spread equally on both sides}

@n At many restaurants, the busiest dinner time is around 7pm, but there are always a few people who want to eat earlier or later.
