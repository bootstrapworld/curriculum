Read each scenario. Draw a *rough* histogram sketch (you do not need to label the axes), then decide if the histogram is skew left, skew right, or symmetric. Explain your interpretation.

@n In the United States, there are a few billionaires that have far greater incomes than the average (about $28,000).

| *Circle one:* @hspace{2em} _skew left @hspace{4em} @ifsoln-choice{skew right} @hspace{4em} symmetric_

Explain your choice: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Most Americans make under 250k/yr, but there are extreme outliers like Elon}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Musk pulling the data to the right, and no one is earning "negative 10}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{billion dollars" to balance out his data}}

@n A school cafeteria mostly buys canned goods in huge sizes (48-64 ounces), but also purchases a few ingredients in smaller sizes.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{on the left (smaller sizes).}}

@n It's just as likely for a newborn baby to be a certain number of ounces below the average weight (approximately 7.5 pounds) as it is to be that number of ounces above the average weight.

@n At many restaurants, the busiest dinner time is around 7pm, but there are always a few people who want to eat earlier or later.
