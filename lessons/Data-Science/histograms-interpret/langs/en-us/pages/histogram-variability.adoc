= Histograms and Variability

@n Students watched 2 videos, and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10. The average score for every video is the same (5.5).

Comparing the two graphs, we know that:

@vspace{1ex}

- [ ] The scores for Movie A have greater variability.

@vspace{1ex}

@ifnotsoln{
- [ ] The scores for Movie B have greater variability.
}
@ifsoln{
- [x] The scores for Movie B have greater variability.
}
@vspace{1ex}

- [ ] The scores for Movie A and Movie B have equal variability.

@vspace{1ex}

- [ ] It is impossible to tell from the given information.

Explain how you arrived at your answer:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The histograms are symmetric and they have the same spread.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{they both have a mean of 5. Movie A has many scores clustered}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{around the mean, while movie B has a gap where the mean is.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Movie A's scores show greater deviation from the mean.}}

@n The following graphs show the distribution of quiz scores for two classes.

[cols="3a,9a,12a", stripes="none", grid ="none"]
|===

| Class 1
| @image{../images/class1quiz.png, 200}

Comparing the two graphs, we know that:

@vspace{1ex}

- [ ] The quiz scores of Class 1 have greater variability.

@vspace{1ex}

@ifnotsoln{
- [ ] The quiz scores of Class 2 have greater variability.
}
@ifsoln{
- [x] The quiz scores of Class 2 have greater variability.
}

@vspace{1ex}

- [ ] The quiz scores of Class 1 and Class 2 have equal variability.

@vspace{1ex}

- [ ] It is impossible to tell from the given information.

| Class 2
| @image{../images/class2quiz.png, 200}

Explain how you arrived at your answer:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Although the bar heights for Class 1 show greater variability,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the scores for Class 2 have greater variability.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In class 1, more scores are close the the mean (between 8 and 9),}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{meaning there is less deviation from the mean.}}

@n Caro says, "Flatter histograms always show less variability." Is she correct? Explain why you agree or disagree with Caro.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Caro is incorrect. Varied bar heights do not necessarily indicate a varied dataset.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Instead, Caro needs to ask if the datapoints in that make up the histogram deviate from the mean.}}
