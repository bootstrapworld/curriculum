Students watched 5 videos, and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10. The average score for every video is the same (5.5).

Match the summary description (left) with the _shape_ of the histogram of student ratings (right).

- The x-axis shows the score, and the y-axis shows the number of students who gave it that score. 
- These axes are intentionally unlabeled -- the *shapes* of the ratings distributions were very different! And that's the focus here.
