Describe two *histograms* made from columns of the animals dataset. +
The first question is provided. You'll need to come up with the second question on your own!

| The histogram I created is for @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{weight}}{x-variable in context} from @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{the animals dataset}}{dataset or subset}.

The shape of this histogram is @fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{skewed right}}{skewed left, skewed right, symmetric}. There are peaks at @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~0-2}} and gaps at @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~140-160}}.

I notice that @fitbruby{}{}{Consider statements like:  Most of the histogram's area is... / A small amount of the histograms area trails out... / etc}

I wonder @fitb{}{}
