= Histograms and Measures of Center

@n The two histograms below represent the amount how the number of minutes spent traveling to school, one for a sample of sixth grade students and one for a sample of eighth grade students.

@n The histogram below shows the ages of the 19 children who signed up for rock climbing camp.

[cols="^3a,<4a"]

| *Distribution of Rock Climbers' Ages*
@image{../images/rock-climbing-ages.png, 210}
| The median age for these 19 climbers is:

@vspace{1ex}

&#9744; about 6 or 7

@vspace{1ex}

@ifsoln-choice{&#9744; about 8 or 9}

@vspace{1ex}

&#9744; about 10 or 11

@vspace{1ex}

&#9744; about 12 or 13

Explain how you determined the median value: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response: I knew that the 10th value is the median, because there are 19 children represented.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I located the 10th value on the histogram, and it was in the 8-10 interval.}}

@n Eleven students were asked to solve a logic puzzle. The minimum time was 5 minutes, and the maximum time was 35 minutes. Times were rounded to the nearest 5 minutes. The distribution of their times is shown on the histogram below.

| Which of the following statements is likely a correct comparison of the mean and median number of minutes spent working?

@vspace{1ex}

&#9744; The mean time is less than the median time.

@vspace{1ex}

&#9744; The mean time is equal to the median time.

@vspace{1ex}

@ifsoln-choice{&#9744; The mean time is greater than the median time.}

@vspace{1ex}

&#9744; It is impossible to determine which time is greater from the given graph.
