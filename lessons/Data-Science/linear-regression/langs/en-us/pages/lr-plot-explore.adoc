== age

[.linkInstructions]
You should already have @ifproglang{pyret}{plotted @show{(code '(lr-plot animals-table "name" "age" "weeks"))}}@ifproglang{codap}{created a Least Squares line with `Weeks` on the x-axis and `Age` on the y-axis} in the @starter-file{animals}.

@n What is the predictor function? @math{y =} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{0.78924}} @math{x +} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{2.30936}}

@n What is the slope? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{0.78924}}

@n What is the y-intercept? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{2.30936}}

@n How long would our line of best fit predict it would take for a 5 year-old animal to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 6 weeks}}

@n What if they were a newborn, or just 0 years old? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 2 weeks}}

@n Does it make sense to find the adoption time for a newborn using this predictor function? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's not very reliable, given that none of the animals in the dataset are newborns.}}

== weight

_Make another @ifproglang{pyret}{lr-plot}@ifproglang{codap}{Least Squares Line}, but this time use the animals' weight as our explanatory variable instead of their age._

@n How long would our line of best fit predict it would take for an animal weighing 21 pounds to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 4 weeks}}

@n What if they weighed 0.1 pounds? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 2.5 weeks}}

== cats
@ifproglang{pyret}{

_Make another `lr-plot`, comparing the `age` v. `weeks` columns for *only the cats* using the following code:_

@n What is the predictor function? @math{y =} @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{0.23161}} @math{x +} @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{2.48598}}

@n What is the slope? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{0.23161}}

@n What is the y-intercept? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{2.48598}}

@n How does this line of best fit for _cats_ compare to the line of best fit for _all animals_? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line of best fit for cats has a stronger correlation.}}
