= Summarizing Correlations with r-values

@vspace{1ex}

The @vocab{correlation} between two quantitative columns can be summarized in a single number, the @math{r}-value.

- The sign tells us whether the correlation is positive or negative.
- Distance from 0 tells us the strength of the correlation.
- Here is how we might interpret some specific r-values:
  * −1 is the strongest possible negative correlation.
  * +1 is the strongest possible positive correlation.
  * 0 means no correlation.
  * ±0.65 or ±0.70 or more is typically considered a "strong correlation".
  * ±0.35 to ±0.65 is typically considered “moderately correlated”.
  * Anything less than about ±0.25 or ±0.35 may be considered weak.

_Note: These cutoffs are not an exact science!_ In some contexts an @math{r}-value of ±0.50 might be considered impressively strong! And sample size matters! We'd be more convinced of a positive relationship in general between cat age and time to adoption if a correlation of +0.57 were based on 50 cats instead of 5.

[.underline]#*Correlation is not causation!*# Correlation only suggests that two variables are related. It does not tell us if one causes the other. For example, hot days are correlated with people running their air conditioners, but air conditioners do not cause hot days!
