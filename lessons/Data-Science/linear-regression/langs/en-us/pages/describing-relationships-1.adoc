@n Describe the relationship between coffee intake and minutes of sleep shown in the data above.

@blanklines{7}{
@ifsoln{There is a moderately strong negative relationship between cups of coffee and amount of sleep a person gets: For each additional cup of coffee consumed, the data predicts roughly 22.2 fewer minutes of sleep. Based on the r-squared value, about 42% of the variation in sleep time can be explained by the amount of coffee consumed.}
