----
 sugar(m) = −3.19m + 12
 r = −0.05
----
| For every additional Marvel Universe movie released each year, the average person is predicted to consume @fitbruby{15ex}{@ifsoln{3.19}}{[amount]} @fitbruby{15ex}{@ifsoln{fewer}}{[more / fewer]} pounds of sugar! This correlation is @fitbruby{40ex}{@ifsoln{practically non-existent}}{[strong, moderate, weak, practically non-existent]}.

[.big]
----
height(s) = 1.65s + 52
r = 0.89
----

| Shoe size and height are @fitbruby{30ex}{@ifsoln{strongly}}{[strongly, moderately, weakly, not]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{positively}}{[positively / negatively]} correlated. If person A is one size bigger than person B, we predict that they will be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{1.65}}{[amount]} inches taller than person B as well.

----
babies(u) = 0.012u + 7.8
r = 0.01
----

| There is @fitbruby{30ex}{@ifsoln{almost no}}{[a strong, a moderate, almost no]} relationship found between the number of Uber drivers in a city and the number of babies born each year.

----
score(w) = -15.3w + 1150
r = −0.65
----

| The correlation between weeks-of-school-missed and SAT score is @fitbruby{40ex}{@ifsoln{moderate}}{[strong, moderate, weak, practically non-existent]} and @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{negative}}{[positive / negative]}. For every week a student misses, we predict a @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{15.3}}{[amount]} point @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{drop}}{[gain / drop]} in their SAT score.


|*5*

[.big]
----
weight(n) = 1.6n + 160
r = 0.12
----

| There is a @fitbruby{40ex}{@ifsoln{weak}}{[strong, moderate, weak, practically non-existent]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{positive}}{[positive / negative]} correlation between the number of streaming video services someone has, and how much they weigh. For each service, we expect them to be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{1.6}}{[amount]} pounds heavier.
