@n What do you think: Can we predict the number of weeks-to-adoption from an animal's age?

@n What do you think: Can we predict the number of weeks-to-adoption from an animal's weight?

@fitb{}{}

@n Do either or both of the relationships appear to be linear?

*Part 2: How much can one point move the line of best fit?*

Open the @online-exercise{https://www.geogebra.org/m/ZcVIxKtF, Interactive Regression Line}. Move the blue point “P”, and see what effect it has on the red line.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Move P so that it is as _far from the other points_ as possible. @hspace{2em} Where did you place it? (@fitb{2em}{}, @fitb{2em}{})

@n Move P so that it is _most_ aligned with the other points. @hspace{2em} Where did you place it? (@fitb{2em}{}, @fitb{2em}{})

@n Could the @vocab{regression line} ever be above or below _all_ the points _(including the blue one you're dragging)_? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No}}

@n Would it be possible to have a line with more points on one side than the other? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No}}

@n Now focus on the @math{r-value}.

 * What is the highest @math{r-value} you can get? @fitb{5em}{} @hspace{2em} Where did you place @math{P}? @hspace{2em} (@fitb{2em}{}, @fitb{2em}{})
 ** What function describes the regression line with this value of @math{P}? @hspace{2em} @math{y =} @fitb{8em}{} @math{x +} @fitb{8em}{}
 * What is the lowest @math{r-value} you can get? @fitb{5em}{} @hspace{2em} Where did you place @math{P}? @hspace{2em} (@fitb{2em}{}, @fitb{2em}{})
 ** What function describes the regression line with this value of @math{P}?  @hspace{2em} @math{y =} @fitb{8em}{} @math{x +} @fitb{8em}{}
