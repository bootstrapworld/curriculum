= Sorting Box Plots

@teacher{Below are three possible grouping options. Your students' responses may vary!}

== Notice & Wonder

@n What do you Notice about the box plots? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible responses: They all have the same range; sometimes the median is in the center, but not always;}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the median varies from plot to plot; the IQR size varies from plot to plot; one of the box plots has only one whisker}}

@n What do you Wonder about the box plots? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{How many data points are represented by each box plot? Do these box plots represent real}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{data sets? Why does one box plot only have one whisker?}}

== Grouping Option #1

Identify two or three logical and related groupings that you could use to sort each of the box plot cards.

@n Group 1 Description: @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{symmetrical}} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A, J, K}}

@n Group 2 Description: @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{skew left / IQR on the right}} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{B, E, F, H, I}}

@n _Optional:_ Group 3 Description: @fitb{21em}{@ifsoln{skew right / IQR on the left}} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{C, D, G, L}}


@n Why are these groupings useful? What can you learn about a box plot based on the feature that you've chosen to focus on?  @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If the box plot is symmetrical, I know that the values are balanced on either side of the center. If the box plot is skew left, }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I know there are outliers on the left. If it is skew right, I know that there are outliers on the right.}}

== Grouping Option #2

Identify two or three logical and related groupings that you could use to sort each of the box plot cards.

@n Group 1 Description: @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{evenly split IQR}} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A, B, D, E, G, I, J, K}}

@n Group 2 Description: @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{asymmetrically split IQR}} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{C, F, H, L}}

@n _Optional:_ Group 3  Description: @fitb{21em}{} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{}


@n Why are these groupings useful? What can you learn about a box plot based on the feature that you've chosen to focus on?  @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When the data is evenly split, I know that the middle 50% of the data is relatively evenly distributed.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When the data is asymmetrically split, I know that data is clumped either on the left or the right of the median.}}

== Grouping Option #3

Identify two or three logical and related groupings that you could use to sort each of the box plot cards.

@n Group 1 Description: @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{narrow IQR}} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{A, D, E, F, I, K, L}

@n Group 2 Description: @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{wide IQR}} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{B, C, G, H, J}}

@n _Optional:_ Group 3 Description: @fitb{21em}{} @hspace{1ex} Cards that belong: @fitb{}{}


@n Why are these groupings useful? What can you learn about a box plot based on the feature that you've chosen to focus on? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When the IQR is narrow, we know that the data points that represent the middle 50% of the data are clustered close together.}}
        
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When the IQR is wide, we know that the data points that represent the middle 50% of the data are spread apart.}}
