After each math test, Mrs. Clara creates a box plot to better understand the distribution of her students' scores. Match each box plot (left) with Mrs. Clara's written description of how her students performed (right).

_Note: At the school where Mrs. Clara teaches, the following grading scale is used: 60%-70% is a D; 70%-80% is a C; 80%-90% is a B; and 90% or higher is an A._
