== Describing Shape

=== Overview

This activity focuses on describing the shape of a box plot.

=== Launch


@teacher{
The @handout{box-plot-cards.adoc} activity students are about to complete requires some teacher preparation. Make sure you've printed and cut out a set of cards for each pair of students before proceeding.

If that preparation is unrealistic for you, project the images for students to refer to as they work through this section and modify the directions accordingly. (Viewing all of the images at once, rather than as individual cards, requires a higher cognitive load for students, so we don't recommend it.)
}


@QandA{
Your teacher will give you and your partner an envelope containing lettered box plot cards. Lay out the cards in front of you.

@Q{What do you Notice about the box plots?}

@Q{What do you Wonder about the box plots?}
}

Let's sort some box plots!

@lesson-instruction{
- With your partner, use the histogram cards to sort the cards into two piles: box plots that are roughly symmetrical, and box plots that are not roughly symmetrical.
- Be prepared to share your groupings with the class.
}

@teacher{
Students should be familiar with the concept of "symmetry", given that they sorted histograms into symmetrical and asymmetrical groupings during @lesson-link{histograms-visualize}.
}


=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- With your partner, use the box plot cards to complete @printable-exercise{sorting-boxplots.adoc}.
- We will pause for discussion after you complete the first section.
}

@teacher{
As you circulate, make note of the different groupings that students use; this will help with facilitation of class discussion and debrief. Encourage students to use appropriate vocabulary (i.e., peak, cluster, gap).
}

Let's debrief.

@QandA{
@Q{How did you group your symmetrical box plots?}
@A{Responses will vary. Students may have grouped their box plots based on the size of the IQR or the whiskers, considering which occupies more spread. There are no wrong answers here.}

@Q{How can you determine what's typical of a symmetrical box plot?}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- With your partner, complete the second section of @printable-exercise{sorting-box-plots.adoc}.
}

@QandA{
@Q{How did you group your asymmetrical box plots?}
@A{Possible groupings: longer left whisker; longer right whisker; evenly split IQR versus unevenly split IQR.}

@Q{How can you determine what's typical of a symmetrical box plot?}
@A{The center of a symmetrical histogram is the line of symmetry. A common misconception is arguing that the center of the axis is the center of the histogram; students must also consider the range of the histogram.}
}

You probably noticed that some box plots have long whiskers to the left, and while others have long whiskers to the right.

Box plots, like histograms, can be characterized as "skew". Let’s compare skew-left, skew-right, and symmetric box plot shapes.

@QandA{

@Q{Envision a skew-left box plot. Where do you think its outliers are? Explain how you know.}

@A{A skew-left box plot trails off to the right. The box plot trails to the because there are very few data points (the outliers) to the right, rather than many (causing tall bars).}
}



== Connecting Box Plots and Histograms

=== Overview
Students learn how to connect this visualization of spread to what they know about histograms.

=== Launch

Box plots and histograms give us two different views of the shape of quantitative data.

@slidebreak


@QandA{
@Q{One of these box plots represents the same data as the histogram. Which one is it? How do you know?}
@A{The first box plot represents the same data as the histogram.}
@A{Sample response: The right whisker of the first box plot is longer, suggesting that there are outliers on the right causing the data to skew right.}

}

@teacher{Students may notice that the left part of the box is larger on the box plot B. Although that observation is correct, the box's larger area does *not* indicate that *more* data points are clustered there. Remind students that an equal number of data points are clustered in each quadrant of the box plot. You can emphasize this core idea as you discuss the table comparing box plots and histograms@ifnotslide{,below.}@ifslide{ on the next slide.}}

=== Investigate

@teacher{

The activity described below is a *continuation* of an activity launched during @lesson-link{histograms-visualize}.

During that activity, students rotated around the room in teams of 3 to posters that were labeled "Skew Left", or "Skew Right", and "Symmetric". At each poster, groups were directed to (1) sketch a histogram of the given distribution, and then (2) describe a dataset or scenario that would produce that data visualization.

A third section of each poster was left blank.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Your teacher has instructed you and your group to stand in front of a poster that says "Symmetric", "Skew Left", or "Skew Right" at the top.
- The paper in front of you should have a histogram and a description of a dataset or scenario that would produce the given distribution.
- In the bottom section of the poster, sketch the box plot that would result in the distribution to match the histogram and scenario.
}

@teacher{
Spend some time debriefing with students, using the prompts below. Responses will vary for each group of students.
}

@QandA{
@Q{Did all of the box plots your classmates developed correctly represent the given scenario?}

@Q{What strategies did you use to make sure that your histogram and box plots matched?}
}


@lesson-instruction{
- Use what you've learned about how box plots and histograms display data differently to complete @printable-exercise{matching-boxplots-to-histograms.adoc}.

- @opt{Complete @opt-printable-exercise{matching-boxplots-to-histograms-2.adoc} and/or the Matching Box Plots to Histograms slide of @opt-starter-file{boxplots}}

@lesson-instruction{

@pd-slide{
*Matching Debrief: Think about shape, don't rely on numbers!*

There are teachers and students who complain about this page. They say that this page is unfair because we didn't label the axes. The stats teachers are always shocked at their colleagues. They say, "It doesn't matter! We're talking about shape. Skew right is skew right, no matter where it falls on the x axis.""

So many kids have sort of a statistical lazy eye. How do you fix that? You wear a patch over the strong eye. By removing the numbers, it forces people to think about the shape. If the numbers are there, you get high achieving algebra students who never learn shape because they keep using the numbers.
}



=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Match the box plots below with the corresponding histograms. How did you make your matches?}
@A{Box plot A represents the same data as histogram C. Box plot B represents the same data as histogram D. Students may suspect that the short whiskers of histogram B match with the short bars on the edges of histogram C. Because box plots represent density and not frequency, this reasoning is incorrect. }

== Data Exploration Project (Box Plots)

=== Overview
Students apply what they have learned about box plots to their chosen dataset. They will add three items to their @starter-file{exploration-project}: (1) at least two box plots, (2) the corresponding five-number summaries, and (3) any interesting questions they develop. 

@teacher{To learn more about the sequence and scope of the Exploration Project, visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration}. For teachers with time and interest, @lesson-link{project-research-paper} is an extension of the Dataset Exploration, where students select a single question to investigate via data analysis.}

=== Launch

Let’s review what we have learned about making and interpreting box plots.

@QandA{
@Q{Does a box plot display categorical or quantitative data? How many columns of data does a box plot display?}
@A{Box plots display a single column of quantitative data.}

@Q{How are box plots similar to histograms? How are they different?}
@A{Box plots and histograms give us two different views on the concept of shape. Histograms have fixed intervals ("bins") with variable numbers of data points in each one. Box plots have variable intervals ("quartiles") with a fixed number of data points in each one.}

@Q{A box plot lets us visualize the five-number summary. What does the five-number summary tell us about the column of data?}
@A{The five-number summary includes the minimum, medium, and maximum. It also includes the median of the lower half of the values, and the median of the upper half of the data points.}
}

=== Investigate

Let’s connect what we know about box plots to your chosen dataset.

@teacher{Students have the opportunity to choose a dataset that interests them from our @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.adoc, "List of Datasets"} in the @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset} lesson.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your chosen dataset starter file in @proglang.
- Remind yourself which two columns you investigated in the @lesson-link{measures-of-center} lesson and make a box plot for one of them.}

@QandA{
@Q{What question does your visualization answer?}
@A{Possible responses: How is the data for a certain column distributed? Are the values close together or really spread out? Are there any outliers?}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Now, write down that question in the top section of @printable-exercise{data-cycle-quantitative.adoc}
- Then, complete the rest of the data cycle, recording how you considered, analyzed and interpreted the question.
- Repeat this process for the other column you explored before (and any others you are curious about).
}

@teacher{If students want to investigate new columns from their dataset, they will need to copy/paste additional Measures of Center and Spread slides into their Exploration Project and calculate the mean, median and modes for the new columns.

Confirm that all students have created and understand how to interpret their box plots. Once you are confident that all students have made adequate progress, invite them to access their @starter-file{exploration-project} from Google Drive.
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- *It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*
- Find the box plot slide in the "Making Visualization" section and copy/paste your first box plot here. Duplicate the slide to add your other box plots.
- Add the five-number summaries from these plots to the corresponding "Measures of Center and Spread" slides. 
- Be sure to also add any interesting questions that you developed while making and thinking about box plots to the "My Questions" slide at the end of the deck.
}

=== Synthesize

- What @vocab{shape} did you notice in your box plots?

- Did you discover anything surprising or interesting about your dataset?

- What, if any, outliers did you discover when making box plots?

- When you compared your findings with others, did you make any interesting discoveries? (For instance: Did everyone find outliers? Was there more or less similarity than expected?)
