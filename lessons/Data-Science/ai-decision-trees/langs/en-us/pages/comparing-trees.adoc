@n What do you Notice about the two decision trees above?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The trees are different because the "not flat" branch of the tree on the right terminates with "mug or cup".}}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you Wonder about the two decision trees?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n The tree on the @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{left}}{[left / right]} is more accurate, while the tree on the @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{right}}{[left / right]} is more efficient.

@n With AI, there is often a trade-off between *efficiency* and *accuracy*. Explain what this statement means to you by describing the efficiency and accuracy of the two example trees.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The tree with four nodes cannot label the six listed items with 100% accuracy. It cannot distinguish between "cup" and "mug".}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The tree with five nodes is more accurate and knows the difference between "cup" and "mug", but it is less efficient.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n How will the decision tree on the left label the items below? Explain your response.

@indented{
a) knife @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"knife"}}

@fitb{}{}

b) chopstick @fitb{}{@ifsoln{uncertain response... maybe "mug"?}}

@fitb{}{}

c) spork @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"fork"}}

@fitb{}{}
