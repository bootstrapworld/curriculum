@n How will the decision tree on the *left* label each of the items below? Explain your response.

@indented{
a) knife @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"knife"}}

@fitb{}{}

b) chopstick @fitb{}{@ifsoln{uncertain response... maybe "mug"?}}

@fitb{}{}

c) spork @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"fork"}}

@fitb{}{}

}

@n What do you Notice about the two decision trees above?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The trees are different because the "not flat" branch of the tree on the right terminates with "mug or cup".}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you Wonder about the two decision trees?

@fitb{}{}

@n AI is *efficient* when the computer performs a task with minimal time, memory, energy or data. Knowing this, which decision tree (above) is more efficient? Explain. How could this be advantageous?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Can you think of any reasons *not* to maximize an AI's efficiency? Explain. _Hint: Think about the decision tree on the right!_
