Using the @opt-starter-file{food}, let's make a @ifproglang{pyret}{*pie-chart*}@ifproglang{codap}{*bar chart*} to see what we can learn about the distribution of land-locked countries and what new questions it may lead us to.

@data-cycle{ ""
  #:question "Are more countries land-locked or not land-locked?"
  #:show-question? #t
  #:question-type "arithmetic"
  #:rows "All the rows"
  #:show-rows? #t
  #:cols "landlocked"
  #:show-cols? #t
  #:filter-fn ""
  #:show-filter? #f
  #:build-fn ""
  #:show-build? #f
  #:expression (if (string=? *proglang* "pyret") '(pie-chart food-table "landlocked") "Set x-axis to `land-locked`. Select `Fuse Dots into Bars` from the Measure menu.")
  #:show-expression? #f
  #:finding "The number of land-locked countries (37) is about 1/3 the number of not land-locked countries (124)."
  #:show-finding? #f
  #:new-question "How does the ratio of land-locked to not land-locked countries differ by population density?"
  #:show-new-question? #t
}

The chart shows that there are @fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{less}}{more / less / about the same number of} land-locked countries @fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{than}}{as / than} not land-locked countries.

@vspace{1ex}

Some new questions this raises include:

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{How does the ratio of land-locked to not land-locked countries differ by population density?}
}

Let's make a *stacked-bar-chart* to see the distribution of religions by region.

@data-cycle{ ""
  #:question "What is the distribution of religions across the regions?"
  #:show-question? #t
  #:question-type "arithmetic"
  #:rows "All the rows"
  #:show-rows? #f
  #:cols "region, rel-maj"
  #:show-cols? #f
  #:filter-fn ""
  #:show-filter? #f
  #:build-fn ""
  #:show-build? #f
  #:expression (if (string=? *proglang* "pyret") '(stacked-bar-chart food-table "region" "rel-maj") "Set x-axis to `region`, and `Fuse Dots into Bars`. Drag `rel-maj` to the center of the display.")
  #:show-expression? #f
  #:finding ""
  #:show-finding? #f
  #:new-question ""
  #:show-new-question? #f
}

The stacked bar chart shows that @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{most}}{most / some / a few} regions have a dominant religious majority. I also notice @fitb{}{@ifsoln{that regions colonized by Europe are predominantly Christian.}}

@vspace{1ex}

Some new questions this raises include:

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{I have friends who aren't Christians and focusing on religious majorities makes it look like all of North America is Christian. How good of a measure if the majority really? What percentage of North American citizens are not part of the religious majority?}
}
