For each question below, complete the first three steps of the Data Cycle. For the final Data Cycle, develop your own question and complete the remaining steps. @ifproglang{pyret}{Once you know what code to write, type it into Pyret and try it out!}@ifproglang{codap}{Once you know what display, measure, or table you'd like to make, create it in CODAP.}
