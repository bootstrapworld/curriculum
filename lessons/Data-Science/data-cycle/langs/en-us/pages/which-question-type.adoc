Start by filling out *ONLY the "Question Type"* column of the table below. +
{empty} +

Based on the Pokemon data above, decide whether each question is best described as:

- *Lookup* -- Answered by only reading the table, no further calculations are necessary! 
- *Arithmetic* -- Answered by doing calculations (comparing, averaging, totalling, etc.) with values from one single column. 
- *Statistical* -- Best asked with "in general" attached, because the answer isn't black and white. If we ask "are dogs heavier than cats?", we know that not every dog is heavier than every cat! We just want to know if it is _generally true_ or _generally false_!
