Using the @starter-file{expanded-animals}, let's make a @ifproglang{pyret}{*pie-chart*}@ifproglang{codap}{*bar chart*} to see what we can learn about the distribution of fixed animals and what new questions it may lead us to.

@data-cycle{ ""
  #:question "Are more animals fixed or unfixed?"
  #:show-question? #t
  #:question-type "arithmetic"
  #:rows "All the rows"
  #:show-rows? #t
  #:cols "fixed"
  #:show-cols? #t
  #:filter-fn ""
  #:show-filter? #f
  #:build-fn ""
  #:show-build? #f
  #:expression (if (string=? *proglang* "pyret") '(pie-chart more-animals "fixed") "Set x-axis to `fixed`. Select `Fuse Dots into Bars` from the Measure menu.")
  #:show-expression? #f
  #:finding "The number of unfixed animals at the shelter (213) is slightly higher than the number of fixed animals (194)."
  #:show-finding? #f
  #:new-question "How does the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals differ by species?"
  #:show-new-question? #t
}

The chart shows that there are @fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{less}}{more / less / about the same number of} fixed animals @fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{than}}{as / than} unfixed animals.

@vspace{1ex}

Some new questions this raises include:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{How does the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals differ by species?}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{How does the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals differ by age?}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Do fixed animals get adopted faster?}}

@span{.sectionbreak}{}

Let's make a *stacked-bar-chart* to see if the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals differs by species.

@data-cycle{ ""
  #:question "How does the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals differ by species?"
  #:show-question? #t
  #:question-type "arithmetic"
  #:rows "All the rows"
  #:show-rows? #f
  #:cols "species, fixed"
  #:show-cols? #f
  #:filter-fn ""
  #:show-filter? #f
  #:build-fn ""
  #:show-build? #f
  #:expression (if (string=? *proglang* "pyret") '(stacked-bar-chart more-animals "species" "fixed") "Set x-axis to `species`, and `Fuse Dots into Bars`. Drag `fixed` to the center of the display.")
  #:show-expression? #f
  #:finding ""

The stacked bar chart shows that @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{most}}{most / some / a few} species have @fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{fewer}}{more / the same number of / fewer} fixed animals @fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{than}}{as / than} unfixed animals. I also notice @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Snails and clownfish are not fixed at all.}}

@vspace{1ex}

Some new questions this raises include:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Do mammals get fixed more often than other animals?}}

@fitb{}{}
