| Data Science is all about _asking questions of data_.

- Sometimes the answer is easy to compute. 
- Sometimes the answer to a question is _already in the dataset_ - +
 no computation needed.
- Sometimes the answer just sparks more questions! 

Each question a Data Scientist asks adds a chapter to the story of their research. Even if a question is a "dead-end", it's valuable to share what the question was and what work you did to answer it!

@n We start by *Asking Questions* after reviewing and closely observing the data. These questions can come from initial wonderings, or as a result of previous data cycle. Most questions can be broken down into one of four categories:

@vspace{1ex}

  * *Lookup questions* - Answered by only reading the table, no further calculations are necessary! Once you find the value, you're done! Examples of lookup questions might be “How many legs does Felix have?” or "What species is Sheba?"

  * *Arithmetic questions* - Answered by doing calculations (comparing, averaging, totaling, etc.) with values from one single column. Examples of arithmetic questions might be “How much does the heaviest animal weigh?” or “What is the average age of animals from the shelter?”

  * *Statistical questions* - These are questions that both _expect some variability in the data_ related to the question and _account for it in the answers_. Statistical questions often involve multiple steps to answer, and the answers aren't black and white. When we compare two statistics we are actually comparing two datasets. If we ask "are dogs heavier than cats?", we know that not every dog is heavier than every cat! We just want to know if it is _generally_ true or _generally_ false!

  * *Questions we can't answer* - We might wonder where the animal shelter is located, or what time of year the data was gathered! But the data in the table won’t help us answer that question, so as Data Scientists we might need to do some research beyond the data. And if nothing turns up, we simply recognize that there are limits to what we can analyze.

@n Next, we *Consider Data*, by determining which parts of the dataset we need to answer our question. Sometimes we don't have the data we need, so we conduct a survey, observe and record data, or find another existing dataset. Since our data is contained in a table, it's useful to start by asking two questions:

@vspace{1ex}

  * What rows do we care about? - Is it all the animals? Just the lizards?
  * What columns do we need? - Are we examining the ages of the animals? Their weights?

@n Then, we *Analyze the Data*, by completing calculations, creating data visualizations, creating new tables, or filtering existing tables. The results of this step are calculations, patterns, and relationships.

@vspace{1ex}

  * Are we making a pie chart? A bar chart? Something else?

@n Finally, we *Interpret the Data*, by answering our original question and summarizing the process we took and the results we found.

@vspace{1ex}

Sometimes the data cycle ends once we've interpreted the data... but often our interpretations lead to new questions... +
*and the cycle begins again!*
