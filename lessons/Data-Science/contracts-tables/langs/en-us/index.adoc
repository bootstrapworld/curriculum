== Functions for Tables @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Building on their understanding of @lesson-link{contracts-strings-images, Contracts}, students will be introduced to functions for working with _tables_, including: @show{(code 'sort)},  @show{(code 'count)}, @show{(code 'first-n-rows)} and @show{(code 'row-n)}.

=== Launch

@QandA{
- Open the @starter-file{animals} and click "Run".
- In the Interactions Window on the right type `animals-table` and hit "Enter" to see the the table.
@Q{What do you Notice?}
@A{Sample response: We only see the first 10 rows of the table and would have to click to see the remaining 22 rows.}
@A{The animals aren't listed in any particular order.}

@Q{What do you Wonder?}
@A{Sample response: Is it possible to alphabetize the list, or sort it in other ways?}
}

@teacher{If this is the first time your students are seeing a table in @starter-file{editor}, you may also want to acknowledge lines 7-10 of the Definitions Area, where `animals-table` is defined along with the names of the 8 columns.}


=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables.adoc} and complete the first section: *Ordering a Table with `sort`*.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What did these `sort` expressions do?}
@A{They took in the `animals-table`, the `name` column, and true or false... producing a new table, sorted alphabetically (A-Z for `true` and Z-A for `false`)}

@Q{What does it mean that the Range of `sort` is Table?}
@A{The function produces a new table.}

@Q{Type `animals-table` and hit "Enter". Did sorting our animals change the value of the table?}
@A{No. It made a new one.}
}

@slidebreak

Let's review what we know about Contracts. Every Contract has three parts:

1. *Name* -- the name of the function, which we type in whenever we want to use it
2. *Domain* -- the type(s) of data we give to the function
3. *Range* -- the type of data the function produces

@lesson-point{
Contracts are the _instruction manual_ for functions.
}

@slidebreak

Let's explore the Contract for another function that works with Tables: `count`

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the second section of @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables.adoc}: *Summarizing a Column with `count`*.
}

@slidebreak


@QandA{
@Q{How did the `count` function summarize a column?}
@A{It made a new table, with rows for all the unique values in that column and a count of how many times each value appeared.}

@Q{Is the summary produced by the `count` function useful when summarizing the `pounds` column? Why or why not?}
@A{Since almost every animal has a unique weight, the summary is almost as long as the original table!}
}

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/frequency-table.png, 110}}The `count` function produces a @vocab{frequency table}, which summarizes the data by showing how often - how _frequently_ - specific values appear in a dataset.

@vocab{Frequency tables} are a commonly used tool in statistics because they give us a quick sense of the distribution and can help us to identify patterns.

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the first two sections of @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables-cont.adoc} to explore some new table functions: `row-n` and `first-n-rows`.
}

@slidebreak

The second input to `row-n` is a Number, called the _index_ of the Row. The index tells Pyret how many data Rows to count from the first one in the table.

If we want the _second_ Row in the table, Pyret needs to count one Row down from the beginning of the table. That's why the index for the second Row is `1`.

@QandA{
@Q{What index number do we need to give `row-n` for Pyret to return the first row of the Table?}
@A{0. Because Pyret is already at the beginning of the table and doesn't need to count down any rows!}

@Q{What is the index of the _fifth_ Row in the table?}
@A{The index of the fifth row is `4`}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete the last section of @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables-cont.adoc}.
- If time allows see if you can put everything we've learned today together to solve the challenge problems!
}

@slidebreak

Sometimes we have a value that we want to use again and again, and it makes sense to define a name for it. Every definition includes a _name_ and a _value_. In the code below, we have definitions for a String, a Number, an Image and a Row.

```
name = "Denny"
age = 16
logo = star(50, "solid", "red")
pet = row-n(animals-table, 3)
```

@QandA{
@Q{What are the names given in each of these definitions?}
@A{name, age, logo amd pet}
@Q{What are the values given to each of these names?}
@A{The String "Denny", the Number 16, an Image of a solid red star, and the 4th Row of the Animals Table.}
@Q{Take a moment to look at the first challenge problem and think. How you would describe the table that `first-n-rows` is taking in?}
@A{It's taking in a table of the animals that has been sorted from lightest to heaviest.}
}


=== Common Misconceptions

Students are likely to think that `sort` _changes the table_, when instead it _produces a new, sorted table._ Encourage students to say out loud what they think they will get if they type `animals-table` after evaluating @show{(code '(sort animals-table "name" true))}. By testing their hypothesis, students who are surprised at the outcome are much more likely to remember the difference later on.

Students often struggle to remember that Row indices start at _zero!_ You'll want to practice this a few times.

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{How is the function of `count` different from `sort`?}
@A{`sort` made a new table that was reordered.}
@A{`count` made a new table that summarized the data from a column of the original table!}

@Q{How does the function `first-n-rows` work?}
@A{It makes a new smaller table with the number of rows you type into the expression.}

@Q{What is important to remember when using the `row-n` function?}
@A{We need to give the function a number that is one less than the row we want.}

@Q{Do you have any questions about the functions or expressions you've worked with today?}

@Q{Where have you seen tables summarizing counts in the real world?}

@Q{How else do journalists and newscasters visualize summaries of data besides in tables?}
@A{Ideally someone will say bar charts!}
}

== Composing with Circles of Evaluation @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students learn to work with more than one function at once, by way of Circles of Evaluation, a visual representation of the underlying structure.

=== Launch

What if we wanted to see the ten youngest animals? 

- How could the `first-n-rows` and `sort` functions work together? 
- What order should we use the functions in?

=== Investigate

One way to organize our thoughts is to diagram what we want to do, using the Circles of Evaluation. 

*The rules for Circles of Evaluation are simple:*

(1) Every Circle of Evaluation must have a single function, written at the top.

(2) The arguments of the function are written left-to-right, in the middle of the Circle.

@indented{
If we want to see the first ten animals, our diagram would look like this.

@do{
(define expB '(first-n-rows animals-table 10))
}

@show{(coe expB)}

Which translates to the following code:
@show{(code expB)}
}

(3) Circles can contain other Circles!

@ifslide{@teacher{This list of rules continues with a diagram for the third point on the next slide.}}

@slidebreak{InvestigateC}

@ifslide{*Circles can contain other circles!*

}
@indented{
If we want to see the ten _youngest_ animals, our diagram would look like this.

@do{
(define exp1 '(first-n-rows (sort animals-table "age" true) 10))
}
[.circle2]
@show{(coe exp1)}
}

@slidebreak{InvestigateC}

@indented{
If we wanted to get extra fancy and see the species count for the youngest ten animals, we could add another layer to our Circle of Evaluation.

@do{
(define exp2 '(count (first-n-rows (sort animals-table "age" true) 10) "species"))
}
[.circle3]
@show{(coe exp2)}
}

_Note: Values like Numbers, Strings, and Booleans are still written by themselves. It’s only when we want to use a function that we need to draw a Circle._

@slidebreak{InvestigateC}

*To convert a Circle of Evaluation into code:*

- We start at the outside and work our way in. 
- After each function we open a pair of parentheses, and then convert each argument inside the Circle. 
- We close each pair of parentheses as we finish with the arguments in its Circle of Evaluation.

@indented{This diagram would translate to the code that follows. 
[.circle2]
@show{(coe exp1)} 

@ifnotslide{@image{images/exp1.png, 450}}
@ifslide{<span style="font-family: Roboto Mono; font-size: 14pt;">first-n-rows(<span style="color:dodgerblue;">sort(animals-table, "age", true)</span>, 10)</span>}
}

@slidebreak{InvestigateC}

@indented{And this diagram would translate to the code that follows.

[.circle3]
@show{(coe exp2)}

@ifnotslide{@image{images/exp2.png, 600}}
@ifslide{<span style="font-family: Roboto Mono; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color:mediumseagreen;">count(</span>first-n-rows(<span style="color:dodgerblue;">sort(animals-table, "age", true,)</span> 10) <span style="color:mediumseagreen;">"species")</span> </span>}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{matching-coe-count-sort-first-n.adoc}
- Match each scenario to the corresponding Circle of Evaluation.
- When you're done, practice translating the Circles of Evaluation into code.
}

@teacher{Confirm that students have correctly identified the matching Circles of Evaluation and have each correctly translated at least one Circle of Evaluation into code. (Note: There is one extra Circle of Evaluation.)}

@lesson-instruction{
- Now turn to @printable-exercise{coe-sort-count.adoc} and practice drawing the Circles of Evaluation yourself.
- Before moving on to the second question, be sure you've translated your Circle of Evaluation into code and tested it out in @starter-file{animals}.

@pd-slide{

*Connect to the Classroom: Contracts are a major pedagogical technique.*

Contracts are the second major pedagogical technique in Bootstrap. Circles of Evaluation are the first one, and contracts are the second.

Contracts are really important because just about every single mistake kids make can be solved by looking at their contracts. The answer is always, “Check your contract.”

And that is important, because it reminds students the value of writing stuff down.
}

@pd-slide{

*Connect to the Classroom: Contracts help students understand domain and range.*

Contracts give students a concrete understanding of a math concept that is pretty abstract.

When everything is a number, it's hard to understand domain and range. Kids wonder why they need to learn them, why they matter.

Domain and range is topic that we often squeeze in the week before finals. But once we have rich data types - like strings, Booleans, and images - domain and range become more concrete.
}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

@pd-slide{

We're building toward an understanding of three different representations for functions and we've already encountered the first one - contracts.

The goal is to get fluent in each representation. Eventually, we're going to talk about how each representation is essentially a tool you can use for solving word problems. If you know how to fit them together, you get a nice road map for attacking virtually any word problem you'll encounter.
