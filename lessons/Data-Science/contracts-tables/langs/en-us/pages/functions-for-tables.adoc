Open the @starter-file{animals} and click "Run". In the Interactions Area (right), type `animals-table`. Hit "Enter" to see the default view of the table.

== Ordering a Table with `sort`

@n Mabel Lee wants to sort this table by `age` (youngest-to-oldest). Juan Carlos wants to sort the table by `pounds`(heaviest-to-lightest). What are some other ways we could sort the table?

@hspace{4em} a. @fitb{}{}

@hspace{4em} b. @fitb{}{}

@center{*Pyret has a function called `sort` that will produce sorted Tables!*}

@n Test out @show{(code '(sort animals-table "age" true))} in the Interactions Area. Try using `false` instead of `true`. +
Complete the sentences below by *circling* the behavior you observed for each Boolean.

[cols="2a, ^3a, ^3a", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|(a) `true` sorts the table...
| in *ascending order* _(from least to greatest)_
| in *descending order* _(from largest to smallest)_

|(b) `false` sorts the table...
| in *ascending order* _(from least to greatest)_
| in *descending order* _(from largest to smallest)_
|===

@n The Domain of `sort` has three inputs. One of them is the table itself. Can you identify the datatypes of the other two?

@indented{
@ifnotsoln{@show{(contract 'sort '((table-name Table) (column-name "                   ") (order "                   ")) "Table")}}
@ifsoln{@show{(contract 'sort '((table-name Table) (column-name "String") (order "Boolean")) "Table")}}
}

@vspace{1ex}

@n What code will sort the animals by alphabetical order of their _names_? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(sort animals-table "name" true))}}}

@n Did you use `true` or `false`? Explain why. @fitb{}{}

== Summarizing a Column with `count`
Let's explore another table function, beginning with its contract:

@show{(contract "count" '("Table" "String") "Table")}

@n What do you expect the code  @show{(code '(count animals-table "legs"))} to produce? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary, but students should be able to predict that they will get a new table!}}

â€€Type the code into the Interactions Area and click "Enter" to test it out.

@n How many animals had 4 legs? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{29}}

@n Think of another question you might be able to answer by making a different table using the `count` function.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response: How many animals are cats?}}

@n Fill in the blanks with the code to make the table: @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{count}}{function-name} (@fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{animals-table}}{table-name {two-colons} Table}, @fitbruby{13em}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary!}}{column-name {two-colons} String})

@n Try using the `count` function to summarize the `pounds` column. Is the resulting summary useful? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No - nearly every animal has a unique weight, so the resulting table is almost as long as the original!}}

@n Tables that summarize data with a count are commonly used in the real world. Write an example of where you've seen them before: +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary! Election Results, Survey Results, Fundraiser Results, etc. }}

@n Newspapers often incorporate data into their reporting. How else might they display this information, besides using a table?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{bar charts, pictographs, infographics}}
