@n How is this program similar to the last one we looked at?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_It uses a helper function and the_ `image-scatter-plot` _function._ }}

@fitb{}{}

@n How is the code for `weight-dot` different from other functions we've seen?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The piecewise function produces dot sizes based on which interval the value falls within!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Can you explain how this code works?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It takes in a row and checks to see which range the weight falls within.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If the weight falls within a given range, it makes a dot of the corresponding size.}}
