@n Write the code to lookup the value of the `age` column for each of the rows listed (the first one has been completed for you).

| row           | code to lookup the value of the `age` column

@n Write the code that uses the `circle` function to draw a solid, blue circle whose radius is the _age of the animal_ for each of the rows listed (the first one has been completed for you).

[cols="1a,4a", options="header"]
|===
| row           | code to draw a circle using the "age" of the row as the radius
| `dog-row`     | `circle(dog-row["age"], "solid", "blue")`
| `old-row`     | @ifsoln{`circle(old-row["age"], "solid", "blue")`}
| `young-row`   | @ifsoln{`circle(young-row["age"], "solid", "blue")`}

@n Check with your partner or another student to confirm that your code matches.
