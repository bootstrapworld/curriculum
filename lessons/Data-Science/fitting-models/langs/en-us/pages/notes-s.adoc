== A Quick Review...

@vspace{1ex}

When viewing a cloud of points on a scatter plot, sometimes we can see a pattern in the data.

- If the points cluster around a straight line, it might mean there's a @vocab{linear relationship} between the @vocab{explanatory variable} (x) and @vocab{response variable} (y).
- The line can slope up or down, indicating a _positive_ relationship (where the two variables increase together) or _negative_ relationship (where the response variable decreases as the explanatory variable increases).

@vspace{1ex}

These lines are known as @vocab{models} for the data. The straight-line function describing a linear relationship is called a _linear model_.

- With a good model, the point cloud will hug the line tightly. A poor model will have lots of points that stray far from the line.
- Models _summarize_ the data. For most datasets that means there will be data points that are not _exactly_ on the line! And sometimes the line of best fit won't even pass through a single point in the dataset.
- We can use *linear regression* (`lr-plot` in Pyret) to compute the _best possible linear model_ for a dataset, known as the *line of best fit*.

== @math{S}: Measuring Error in a Model

@vspace{1ex} +
Differences between the predicted y-value and actual y-value for each x-value are called @vocab{residuals}. +
A residual tells us "how wrong" the model was at that particular point. +
{empty} +
@hspace{1em} @big{@math{\text{Data} = \text{Model} + \text{Error}}} +
{empty} +
We can summarize the error for _all_ the points in a dataset using the @vocab{Standard Deviation of the Residuals} - known as @vocab{S} - to get a sense of how much to trust the predictions made by a model.  +
{empty} +

- @vocab{S} is expressed in terms of _units of the response variable_ (y) and tells us how much error we expect in predictions made from the model. +
_(e.g. up to $8000, 5 years, 11 inches, etc. )_
- The closer the data points are to the model, the smaller the residuals are, and the smaller @vocab{S} will be.
- If the @vocab{S-value} for a model is zero, _it fits the data perfectly!_
- When we compare two models for the same dataset, the one with the lower @vocab{S-value} fits better.
- We have no way of knowing whether or not @vocab{S-values} represent a small or large amount of error until we consider them in relation to the range of the dataset! _(e.g. errors of $20,000 are huge in the context of median salary, but small in the context of national budgets.)_
