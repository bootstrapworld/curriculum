== A Quick Review...

@vspace{1ex}

When viewing a cloud of points on a scatter plot, sometimes we can see a pattern in the data.

- If that pattern can be shown with a straight line, it might mean there's a @vocab{linear relationship} between the x- and y-axis
- The line can slope up or down, indicating a _positive_ or _negative_ relationship

@vspace{1ex}

These lines are known as @vocab{models} for the data. The straight-line function describing a linear relationship is called a _linear model_.

- With a good model, the point cloud will hug the line tightly. A poor model will have lots of points that stray far from the line.
- Since models _summarize_ the data, they will never be able to explain every detail of the dataset: there will always be data points that are not _exactly_ on the line!
- For any given x-value, the difference between the model's predicted y-value and the actual y-value is part of the model's _error:_ +
@hspace{5em} @big{@math{\text{Data} = \text{Model} + \text{Error}}}
- We can use *linear regression* (`lr-plot` in Pyret) to compute the _best possible linear model_ for a dataset, known as the *line of best fit*.

== @math{S}: Measuring Error in a Model

The difference between the y-value of a data point and the y-value predicted by the model for that same x-value is called a @vocab{residual}. +
{empty} +
A residual measures the error of the model at a specific x-value, telling us "how wrong" the model was at that particular point. By summarizing the error for _all_ the points, we can get a measure of how much error the model has for a given dataset. +
{empty} +
The @vocab{Standard Deviation of the Residuals} - known as @vocab{S} - does exactly this, and is a useful measures of the fitness of a given model.

- @vocab{S} is expressed in terms of _units of the response variable_ (y) and tells us how much error we expect in predictions made from the model (eg. up to $8000, 5 years, 11 inches, etc. )
- The closer the data points are to the model, the smaller the residuals are, and the smaller @vocab{S} will be!
- If the @vocab{S-value} for a model is zero, _it fits the data perfectly!_
- When we compare two models for the same dataset, the one with the lower @vocab{S-value} fits better.
- We have no way of knowing whether or not other @math{S-values} represent a small or large amount of error until we consider them in relation to the range of the dataset! (eg. errors of $20,000 are huge in the context of median salary, but small in the context of national budgets.)
