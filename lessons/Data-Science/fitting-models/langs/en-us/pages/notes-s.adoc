== Relationships Between two Quantitative Columns

@vspace{1ex}

Scatter plots can be used to look for relationships between columns. Each row in the dataset is represented by a point, with one column providing the x-value (@vocab{explanatory variable}) and the other providing the y-value (@vocab{response variable}). The resulting “point cloud” makes it possible to look for a relationship between those two columns.

@vspace{1ex}

- _Form_

  * If the points in a scatter plot appear to follow a straight line, it suggests that a @vocab{linear relationship} exists between those two columns.
  * Relationships may take other forms (u-shaped for example). If they aren't linear, it won't make sense to look for a correlation.
  * Sometimes there will be no relationship at all between two variables.

- _Direction_

  * The correlation is *positive* if the point cloud slopes up as it goes farther to the right. This means larger y-values tend to go with larger x-values.
  * The correlation is *negative* if the point cloud slopes down as it goes farther to the right.

- _Strength_

  * It is a *strong* correlation if the points are tightly clustered around a line. In this case, knowing the x-value gives us a pretty good idea of the y-value.
  * It is a *weak* correlation if the points are loosely scattered and the y-value doesn't depend much on the x-value.

== Line of Best Fit

@vspace{1ex}

@vocab{Linear Relationships} can be graphically summarized by drawing a straight line through the data cloud.  For most datasets, there is no line that will touch every dot, so _all of the possible models will have some error_, compared to the original data! But if the line is close enough to enough of the dots, the model can still help us reason and make predictions about y-values from x-values

@center{@big{
@math{\text{Data} = \text{Model} + \text{Error}}
}}

The line that is _closest_ to all the other points is known as the @vocab{line of best fit}, meaning it is the _best possible summary_ of the relationship and therefore the _best possible model_. While we can draw a line that generalizes the pattern we see ourselves, it probably won't actually be the *best possible* linear model for the data.

@vspace{1ex}

*Linear Regression* is a way of computing the *line of best fit*.  It considers every single data point to generate the optimal linear model, with the smallest possible vertical distance between the line and all the points taken together. _(More specifically, the computer minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from all of the points to the line. There's a reason we use computers to do this!)_

@vspace{1ex}

Points that do not fit the trend line in a scatter plot are called *unusual observations*.

== @math{S}: How well does the Model fit the Data?

@vspace{1ex}

The difference between the y-value of a data point and the y-value predicted by the model for that same x-value is called a @vocab{residual}.

@vspace{1ex}

@vocab{S} is a measure of fitness, which refers to the @vocab{Standard Deviation of the Residuals}.

- @vocab{S} is expressed in terms of _units of the response variable_ (y) and tells us how much error we expect in predictions made from the model (eg. up to $8000, 5 years, 11 inches, etc. )
- The closer the data points are to the model, the smaller the residuals are, and the smaller @vocab{S} will be!
- If the @vocab{S-value} for a model is zero, _it fits the data perfectly!_
- When we compare two models for the same dataset, the one with the lower @vocab{S-value} fits better.
- We have no way of knowing whether or not other @math{S-values} represent a small or large amount of error until we consider them in relation to the range of the dataset! (eg. errors of $20,000 are huge in the context of median salary, but small in the context of national budgets.)
