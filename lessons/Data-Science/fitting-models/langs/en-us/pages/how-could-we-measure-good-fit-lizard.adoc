@n Use a straightedge to draw the @vocab{line of best fit} that best summarizes the relationship you see in the data on the scatter plot.

@n Describe how you decided where to draw the line. @fitb{}{}

== Comparing Models

@n Some other students drew the two lines below. Do you think `f(x)` or `g(x)` is a better model for this data? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{f - reasoning will vary.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It splits the data points more evenly}.}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{More points are closer to the line.}}

@n What could we measure, to calculate _how much better of a model_ it is? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The distance between each of the points and the line.}}


@n _Neither of these models is the best possible model!_ What would have to be true of a third model, for us to know that it was a better fit than these two? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If the average distance between the points and the line is smaller.}}
