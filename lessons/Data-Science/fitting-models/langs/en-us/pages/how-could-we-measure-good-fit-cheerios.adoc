@n Do you think `f(x)` or `g(x)` is a better model for this data? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`g(x)`}}

@n What makes you think that? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample answer:`f(x)` doesn't seem very balanced.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{One point sits to the left of f(x) while 8 points are on the left of it, with those 8 points further from the line. }} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`g(x)` appears to be a bit more balanced, with 4 points above the line and 5 below.}}

@n What could we measure, to calculate _how much better of a model_ it is? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample answer: Measure the distance from the line to the points}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n _Neither of these models is the best possible model!_ What would have to be true of a third model, for us to know that it was a better fit than these two? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample Answer: The line is closer overall to all of the data points.}} +
@fitb{}{}
