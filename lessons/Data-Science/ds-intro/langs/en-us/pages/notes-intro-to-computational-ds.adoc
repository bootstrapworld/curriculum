= Introduction to Computational Data Science

Many important questions (“What’s the best restaurant in town?”, “Is this law good for citizens?”, etc.) are answered with _data_. Data Scientists try and answer these questions by writing _programs that ask questions about data_.

Data of all types can be organized into *Tables*.

- Every Table has a *header row* and some number of *data rows*.
- *Quantitative data* is numeric and measures _an amount_, such as a person’s height, a score on a test, distance, etc. A list of quantitative data can be ordered from smallest to largest.
- *Categorical data* is data that specifies _qualities_, such as sex, eye color, country of origin, etc. Categorical data is not subject to the laws of arithmetic -- for example, we cannot take the “average” of a list of colors.
