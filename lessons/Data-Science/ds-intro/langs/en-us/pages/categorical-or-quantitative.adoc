- *Quantitative data* measures an _amount_ and can be ordered from smallest to largest.
- *Categorical data* specifies _qualities_ and is not subject to the laws of arithmetic -- for example, we cannot take the “average” of a list of colors.

_Note: Numbers can be sometimes be categorical rather than quantitative!_
