- *Quantitative data* measures an _amount_ and can be ordered from smallest to largest.
- *Categorical data* specifies _qualities_ and is not subject to the laws of arithmetic -- for example, we cannot take the “average” of a list of colors. _Note: Numbers can sometimes be categorical rather than quantitative!_

@star We can sort the animals in _ascending order_ (smallest-to-largest) by `age` and then sort the table in _alphabetical order_ (A-to-Z) by `name`. +
Does that mean `name` is a quantitative column? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just because a column _can_ be sorted doesn't mean that it's quantitative.}} +
