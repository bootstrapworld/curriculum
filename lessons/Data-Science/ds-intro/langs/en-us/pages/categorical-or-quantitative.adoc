- *Quantitative data* measures an _amount_ and can be ordered from smallest to largest.
- *Categorical data* specifies _qualities_ and is not subject to the laws of arithmetic -- for example, we cannot take the “average” of a list of colors.

@indented{__Note: Numbers can be sometimes be categorical rather than quantitative!__}

For each piece of data below, circle whether it is *Categorical* or *Quantitative*.

@star We decide to sort the animals in _ascending order_ (smallest-to-largest) by `age`. Then we sort the table in _alphabetical order_ (A-to-Z) by `name`. Does that mean `name` is a quantitative column? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just because a column _can_ be sorted doesn't mean that it's quantitative.}} +
