Find the measures of center and spread to summarize the @fitb{20ex}{pounds} column of the Animals Table. 

Be sure to add examples to your Contracts page as you work.

== Measures of Center

The three measures of center for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===
| Mean (Average) 		| Median 		| Mode(s)
| @ifsoln{approx. 39.7} | @ifsoln{11.3} | @ifsoln{[list: 0.1, 6.5]}
|===

Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{higher}}{higher/lower/about equal} compared to the median, this suggests the shape is @fitbruby{60ex}{@ifsoln{skewed right}}{skewed right (or high outliers) / skewed left (or low outliers) / symmetric}.

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===
| Minimum 	  	| Q1 			| Median 		| Q3 			| Maximum
| @ifsoln{0.1}	| @ifsoln{3.9}	| @ifsoln{11.3}	| @ifsoln{60.4} | @ifsoln{172}
|===

== Displaying Center and Spread with a Box Plot

Draw a box plot from this summary on the number line below. 

Be sure to label the number line with consistent intervals.

@ifsoln{@centered-image{../images/boxplot.png}}

From this summary and box plot, I conclude:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{While the animals' weights range from 0.1 pounds to 172 pounds,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{50% of the animals weigh 11.3 pounds or less. The animal that}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{weighs 172 pounds may be an outlier.}}

@fitb{}{}
