@link-instructions{Find the measures of center to summarize the `pounds` column of the @starter-file{animals}, then respond to the prompts.}

@n The three measures of center for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===
| Mean (Average) 		| Median 		| Mode(s)

@ifproglang{pyret}{
| `mean(animals-table, "pounds")`
| `median(animals-table, "pounds")`
| `modes(animals-table, "pounds")`
}

| @ifsoln{approx. 39.7} | @ifsoln{11.3} | @ifsoln{[list: 0.1, 6.5]}
|===


@n If we scan the dataset, we can quickly see that *most* of the animals weigh less than the mean weight. Why is the average so high? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Kujo and Mr. Peanutbutter! Their weights skew the average.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Referring to the pounds column of the Animals dataset, fill in the blanks:

- Outliers on the right pull the mean toward the right, causing the mean to be @fitbruby{25ex}{@ifsoln{greater than}}{greater than / less than} the median. +
When the mean is greater than the median, the shape of the data is @fitbruby{25ex}{@ifsoln{skewed right}}{skewed right / skewed left }.

- Outliers on the left pull the mean toward the left, causing the mean to be @fitbruby{25ex}{@ifsoln{less than}}{greater than / less than} the median. +
When the mean is less than the median, the shape of the data is @fitbruby{25ex}{@ifsoln{skewed left}}{skewed right / skewed left }.



@n In the dot plot below, identify which line is the median and which is the mean. Then label the lines. +
_Hint: You can refer to the table at the top of the page._

@center{@image{../images/num-line-pounds2.png, 400}}

- Which has more data clustered quite close to it, the median or the mean? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{median}}
- Which do you think better represents the data, the median or the mean? Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The median is more appropriate;}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{high outliers are pulling the mean to be higher than what is typical.}}

@n What did you learn from calculating the mode(s)? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The most common animal weights are 0.1 and 6.5!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{That's well below our mean and even our median, which is further evidence of outliers or skewness.}}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
@n In the Interactions area of the @starter-file{animals}, type `modes(animals-table, "species")`. What does Pyret return? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{[list: "dog"]}}
}

@n Are there any measures of center that we can use for categorical data? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes, mode!}}

@n For which quantitative column(s) in the animals table do you think the modes might be a good measure of center? Why? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Legs, because there aren't very many values to choose from. We can also find the mode of categorical columns, such as species.}}


@n To take the average of a column, we add all the numbers in that column and divide by the number of rows. Will that work for every column?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No! We can only find the average of @vocab{quantitative} data. For example, the mean of a list of apple varieties doesn't make sense.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{And, even though we can technically divide a sum of zip codes, the output doesn't correspond to some “center” zip code so it wouldn't make sense either.}}
