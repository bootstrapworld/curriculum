= Measures of Center and Spread

@vspace{1ex}

**There are three values used to report the _center_ of a dataset**. 

@vspace{1ex}

- Each of these measures of center summarizes a whole column of quantitative data using just one number:

  * The *mean* of a dataset is the average of all the numbers.
  * The *median* of a dataset is a value that is smaller than half the dataset, and larger than the other half. In an ordered list the median will either be the middle number or the average of the two middle numbers.
  * The *mode(s)* of a dataset is the value (or values) occurring most often. When all of the values occur equally often, a dataset has no mode.

- __When a dataset is symmetric__, values are just as likely to occur a certain distance above the mean as below the mean, and the median and mean are usually close together.

- __When a dataset is asymmetric__, the median is a more decriptive measure of center than the median.

  * A dataset with *left skew* has a few values that are unusually low, which pull the mean _below_ the median.
  * A dataset with *right skew* has a few values that are unusually high, which pull the mean _above_ the median.

- When a dataset contains a small number of values, the mode may be the most descriptive measure of center.

**Data Scientists can also measure the _spread_ of a dataset using a _five-number summary_:**

@vspace{1ex}

- @vocab{Minimum}: _the smallest value in a dataset - it starts the first quarter_
- @vocab{Q1 (lower quartile)}: _the number that separates the first quarter of the data from the second quarter of the data_
- **_Q2 (@vocab{Median})_**: _the middle value (median) in a dataset_
- @vocab{Q3 (upper quartile)}: _the value that separates the third quarter of the data from the last_
- @vocab{Maximum}: _the largest value in a dataset - it ends the fourth quarter of the data_
