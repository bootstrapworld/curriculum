@n Do you think there is a midpoint of this sample? Why or why not?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{Possible answer: with an even number (32) points, there can't be a "middle point".}
}

@n Do you think there is a value that's repeated more than any other value? Why or why not?

@blanklines{3}{
@ifsoln{With dots stacked on top of one another, we know that some numbers must be repeated. The high stack should be the "most repeated".}
}
