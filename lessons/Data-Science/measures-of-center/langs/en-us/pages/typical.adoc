@n Do you think there is a midpoint of this sample? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible answer: with an even number (32) points, there can't be a "middle point".}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Do you think there is a value that's repeated more than any other value? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{With dots stacked on top of one another, we know that some numbers must be repeated.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The high stack should be the "most repeated".}}
