= Circles of Evaluation: Count, Sort, First-n-rows

For each scenario below, draw the Circle of Evaluation and then use it to write the code. 

When you're done, test your code out in the @starter-file{animals} and make sure it does what you'd expect it to.

@show{(contract "count" '("Table" "String") "Table")}

@show{(contract "first-n-rows" '("Table" "Number") "Table")}

@show{(contract "sort" '("Table" "String" "Boolean") "Table")}

@do{

(define exp1 '(first-n-rows (sort animals-table "weeks" true) 10))
(define exp2 '(first-n-rows (sort animals-table "pounds" false) 1))
(define exp3 '(sort(first-n-rows(animals-table 8) "name" true)))
(define exp4 '(count(first-n-rows(sort animals-table "pounds" true) 16) "species"))

}
