= Catching Bugs (`sort`)

== Learning about a Function through Error Messages

@n Type `sort` into the Interactions Area of @starter-file{editor} and hit "Enter". What do you learn? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{sort is a function}}

@n We know that all functions will need an open parenthesis and at least one input! Type @show{(code '(sort animals-table))} in the Interactions Area and hit Enter/return. Read the error message. What hint does it give us about how to use this function?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The Domain of the sort function is Table, String, Boolean.}}

== What Kind of Error is it?

[.indentedpara]
--
@vocab{syntax errors} -  when the computer cannot make sense of the code because of unclosed strings, missing commas or parentheses,  etc.
@vocab{contract errors} - when the function isn't given what it needs (the wrong type or number of arguments are used)
--

@n In your own words, the difference between @vocab{syntax errors} and @vocab{contract errors} is: @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

== Finding Mistakes with Error Messages

_The following lines of code are all BUGGY! Read the code and the error messages below, and see if you can the mistake WITHOUT typing it into @proglang._

@n `sort(animals-table, name , true)`

[.indentedpara]
--
The identifier @span{.underline}{*name*} is unbound:

sort(animals-table, *name* , true)

It is @span{.underline}{*used*} but not previously defined.

--				

@hspace{2em} This is a @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{syntax}}{contract / syntax} error. The problem is that @fitb{}{ @ifsoln{the string is missing quotes.}}


@n `sort(animals-table, "name" , "true")`

[.indentedpara]
--
The @span{.underline}{*Boolean annotation*}: +
fun sort(t :: Table, col :: String, asc :: *Boolean*) +
was not satisfied by the value +
@indented{"true"}

--

@hspace{2em} This is a @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{contract}}{contract / syntax} error. The problem is that @fitb{}{@ifsoln{true should not be a String.}}



@n `sort(animals-table "name" true)`

[.indentedpara]
--
Pyret didn't understand your program around:

sort(animals-table *"name"* true)

You may need to add or remove some text to fix your program. Look carefully before @span{.underline}{*the highlighted text*}. Is there a missing colon (:), comma (,), string marker ("), or keyword? Is there something there that shouldnâ€™t be?
--

@hspace{2em} This is a @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{syntax}}{contract / syntax} error. The problem is that @fitb{}{ @ifsoln{the commas that should be separating the arguments are missing.}}



@n `sort(animals-table, "name", true`

[.indentedpara]
--
Pyret didn't expect your program to @span{.underline}{end} as soon as it did:

sort(animals-table, "name", true

You may be missing an "end", or closing punctuation like ")" or "]" somewhere in your program.

--

@hspace{2em} This is a @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{syntax}}{contract / syntax} error. The problem is that @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the closing parenthesis is missing.}}


@n `sort (animals-table, "name", true)`

[.indentedpara]
--
Pyret thinks this code is probably a function call:

*sort* _(animals-table, "name", true)_

Function calls must not have space between the @span{.underline}{*function expression*} and the @span{.underline}{_arguments_}.
--

@hspace{2em} This is a @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{syntax}}{contract / syntax} error. The problem is that @fitb{}{@ifsoln{there shouldn't be a space between sort and the parentheses.}}
