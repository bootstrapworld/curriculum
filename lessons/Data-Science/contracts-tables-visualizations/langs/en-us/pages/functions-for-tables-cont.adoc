= Functions for Tables (continued)

== Defining a Row
@vspace{1ex}

*In addition to Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Images and Table, Pyret has a datatype for an individual `Row`.*

@n Type @show{(code '(row-n animals-table 0))}, then @show{(code '(row-n animals-table 1))}. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The first two rows of the table}}

@n Write the Contract for the `row-n` function: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`row-n {two-colons} Table,  Number -> Row`}}

@n Explain what the second input to `row-n` means, in as much detail as possible. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's the index of the Row, starting at zero}} +
@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*Pyret lets us _define_ values that we want to use later*

@n Type @show{(code '(define x (* 4 2)))} into the Interactions Area and hit "Enter". Then try @show{(code '(+ x 1))}. What did you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{9}}

@n We can define any kind of values we like! Try @show{(code '(define gt (triangle 50 "solid" "green")))}, then @show{(code 'gt)}. What did you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A solid green triangle}}

@n Looking back at the @starter-file{animals}, explain what is happening on line 14. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are defining `cat-row` to be the first Row in the table}} +
@fitb{}{}

@star On line 16 of the Definitions Area, add a new definition called `my-pet`, which is defined to be your favorite animal.

== Grabbing Multiple Rows

@n Type @show{(code '(first-n-rows animals-table 5))}. What happens? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It returns a new table with the first 5 rows from the `animals-table`}}

@n If we wanted a table of the first 3 rows of the `animals-table`, what code would you write? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(first-n-rows animals-table 3))}}}

@n What is the Contract for `first-n-rows`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`first-n-rows {two-colons} Table,  Number -> Table`}}

@n Add a new line to the bottom of the Definitions Area, defining a subset of the first 3 rows of the animals-table with the name `first-3`. Write the code you used below: +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(define first-3 (first-n-rows animals-table 3)))}}}

@vspace{1ex}

@star What happens when you type @show{(code '(first-n-rows (sort animals-table "pounds" true) 5))}?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It returns a new table with 5 rows of data for the lightest 5 animals in the `animals-table`.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{_Note: In this case, the output of `sort(animals-table, "pounds", true)` is the Table `first-n-rows` is taking in!_}

@vspace{1ex}

@star &#9733; See if you can figure out how to compose the code that would generate a table of the 10 oldest animals!

@fitbruby{13em}{@ifsoln{first-n-rows}}{function-name} (@fitbruby{35em}{@ifsoln{sort(animals-table, "age", false)}}{Table}, @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{10}}{Number})
