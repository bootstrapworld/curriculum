== Making Box Plots @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the notion of _spread_ in a dataset. They learn about quartiles, box plots, and how to use them to talk about spread.

=== Launch
When we explored measures of center, we tried to answer a question about "typical" values. We considered a fact - that _the Animal Shelter Bureau says the average pet weighs almost 41 pounds_.

How useful is this fact, really? Maybe all the pets weigh between 35 and 45 pounds, with every pet close to the mean. But maybe all the pets are super small or huge, and no one is even _near_ to the mean!


So once we have our summary for a "normal value", it's likely we'll ask another question: _If the average pet is 41 pounds, just **how typical** is that?_

There are differences in every class of students. Not everyone likes the same music, not everyone dresses the same, etc. So we'd expect some deviation - or @vocab{spread} - in any class of students! Some classes are more different than others. How do we measure the @vocab{spread} of a population?

@center{@image{images/box-n-whisker-plot.png, 500}}

Suppose we lined up all animals' weights from smallest to largest, and then split them in half by taking the @vocab{median}. We can learn something about the @vocab{spread} of the dataset by taking the _median of each half_, splitting the population into four equal-sized @vocab{quartiles}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- The first quartile (Q1) is the value for which 25% of the animals weighed that amount or less.
- What animals does the *third* quartile represent?
** _The third quartile is the value for which 75% of the animals weighed that amount or less._

Besides looking at the median as center, and the spread between Q1 and Q3, we also gain valuable information from the spread of the entire dataset—that is, the distance between minimum and maximum. This is called the @vocab{range of a dataset}. (*Note*: the term “Range” means something different in statistics than it does in algebra and programming!)

Splitting a dataset into @vocab{quartiles} gives us five numbers that we can play with to measure spread. To summarize what we've seen so far:

. @vocab{Minimum}: _the smallest value in a dataset_
. Q1: _the median that falls between the minimum and Q2_
. Q2: @vocab{Median}: _the middle value (median) in a dataset_
. Q3: _the median that falls between and Q2 and the maximum_
. @vocab{Maximum}: _the largest value in a dataset_

Taken together these are called the **5 Number Summary** of a dataset, and this summary is one tool for calculating spread. We can use these numbers to calculate two new values:

- Maximum - Minimum = _@vocab{Range}_ :  _the distance spanned by the extreme values in the dataset_
- Q3 - Q1 = @vocab{IQR}:  _the @vocab{Interquartile Range}, or the distance spanned by the middle half of the data_

=== Investigate
We can use @vocab{box plots} to visualize the 5 number summary, the Range, and the Interquartile Range. Below is the contract for `box-plot`, along with an example that will make a box plot for the `pounds` column in the `animals-table`.

```
box-plot :: (t::Table, col::String) -> Image
# Consumes a table and the name of the column
# to plot, and produces a box plot"
box-plot(animals-table, "pounds")
```

[.lesson-point]
Box plots divide our sample into equally-sized groups, and show where those groups are spread thin or clumped together.

[.lesson-instruction]
Type `box-plot(animals-table, "pounds")` into the Interactions Area, and see the resulting plot.

@center{@image{images/5-plot.png,  400}}

This plot shows us the center and spread in our dataset according to those five numbers.

- **Minimum** (the left “whisker”) - the smallest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s just 0.1 pounds.
- **Q1** (the left edge of the box) - computed by taking the _median of the lower half of the values_. In the pounds column, that’s 3.9 pounds.
- **Q2** / Median value (the line in the middle), which is the middle Quartile of the whole dataset. We already computed this to be 11.3 pounds.
- **Q3** (the right edge of the box), which is computed by taking the _median of the upper half of the values_. That’s 60.4 pounds in our dataset.
- **Maximum** (the right “whisker”) - the largest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s 172 pounds.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Turn to @printable-exercise{measures-of-center/pages/summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}
* Fill in the five-number summary for the `pounds` column, and sketch the box plot.
* What conclusions can you draw about the distribution of values in this column?
** _While the animals' weights range from 0.1 pounds to 172 pounds, 50% of the animals weigh 11.3 pounds or less. The animal that weighs 172 pounds may be an outlier._

=== Common Misconceptions
It is extremely common for students to forget that every quartile _always_ includes 25% of the dataset. This will need to be heavily reinforced.

== Interpreting Box Plots @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to read a box plot, and consider spread and variability. They connect this visualization of spread to what they learned about histograms.

=== Launch
Just as pie and bar charts are ways of visualizing categorical data, box plots and histograms are both ways of visualizing the shape of quantitative data.

Box plots make it easy to see the 5-number summary, and compare the Range and Interquartile Range. Histograms make it easier to see skewness and more details of the shape, and offer more granularity when using smaller bins.

Left-skewness is seen as a long tail in a histogram. In a box plot, it's seen as a longer left "whisker" or more spread in the left part of the box. Likewise, right skewness is shown as a longer right "whisker" or more spread in the right part of the box.

[.lesson-point]
Box plots and histograms give us two different views on the concept of shape.

|               | Intervals | Points-per-Interval
| **Box Plots** | Variable  | Fixed
| **Histograms**| Fixed     | Variable
|===

*Histograms:* fixed intervals (“bins”) with variable numbers of data points in each one. Points “pile up in bins”, so we can see how many are in each. __Larger bars show where the clusters are.__

*Box plots:* variable intervals (“quartiles”) with a fixed number of data points in each one. Treats data more like “pizza dough”, dividing it into four equal quarters showing where the data is tightly clumped or spread thin. __Smaller intervals show where the clusters are.__

@span{.title}{Kinesthetic Activity}

Divide the class into groups, and give each group a ruler and a ball of playdough. Have them draw a number line from 0-6 with the ruler, marking off the points at 0, 3, 4, 4.5 and 6 inches. Have the groups roll the dough into a thick cylinder, divide that cylinder in half, and then split each half to form four __equally-sized cylinders__. The playdough represents a @vocab{sample}, with values divided into four @vocab{quartiles}.

Box plots stretch and squeeze these equal quartiles across a number line, so that each quartile fills up an interval in that quartile. On their number line, students have intervals from 0-3, 3-4, 4-4.5, and 4.5-6. Have students roll their cylinders so that they fill each of these intervals, retaining a uniform thickness.

They should notice that shorter intervals have __thicker cylinders__, and longer ones have skinny ones. Even though a box plot doesn't show us the thickness of the datapoints, we can tell that a small intervals has the same amount of data "squeezed" into it as a large interval.

@span{.title}{Modified Box Plots}
More Statistics- or Math-oriented classes will also be familiar with __modified box plots__ (@link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm_852R8JPw, video explanation}), which remove outliers from the box-and-whisker and draw them as asterisks outside of the plot. Modified box plots are also available in Bootstrap:Data Science, using the following contract:

@show{(contract 'modified-box-plot '((t Table) (col String)) "Image")}

You've learned about @covab{quartiles}, max and min, @{interquartile range}, and more. With a partner, complete the @printable-exercise{boxplot-vocab-map.pdf, Box Plot Vocab Concept Map} and see if you can draw connections between these concepts!

=== Synthesize
Histograms, box plots, and measures of center and spread are all different ways to get at the @vocab{shape} of our data. It's important to get comfortable using every tool in the toolbox when discussing shape!

We started talking about measures of center with a single question: __is "average" the right measure to use when talking about animals' weights?__ Now that we've explored the spread of the dataset, do you agree or disagree that average is the right summary?
