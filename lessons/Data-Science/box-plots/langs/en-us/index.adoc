== Making Box Plots @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the notion of _spread_ in a dataset. They learn about quartiles, box plots, and how to use them to talk about spread.

=== Launch
When we explored measures of center, we tried to answer a question about "typical" values. We considered a fact - that _the Animal Shelter Bureau says the average pet weighs almost 40 pounds_.

How useful is this fact, really? Maybe all the pets weigh between 35 and 45 pounds, with every pet close to the mean. But maybe all the pets are super small or huge, and no one is even _near_ to the mean!

So once we have our summary for a "normal value", it's likely we'll ask another question: _If the average pet is 40 pounds, just **how typical** is that?_

There are differences in every class of students. Not everyone likes the same music, not everyone dresses the same, etc. So we'd expect some deviation - or @vocab{spread} - in any class of students! Some classes are more different than others. How do we measure the @vocab{spread} of a population?

@center{@image{images/box-n-whisker-plot.png, 500}}

Suppose we lined up all animals' weights from smallest to largest, and then split them in half by taking the @vocab{median}. We can learn something about the @vocab{spread} of the dataset by taking the _median of each half_, splitting the population into four equal-sized quarters. The boundary points between these quarters are called @vocab{quartiles}.

@lesson-instruction{
- The first quartile (Q1) is the value for which 25% of the animals weighed that amount or less.
- What animals does the *third* quartile represent?
** _The third quartile is the value for which 75% of the animals weighed that amount or less.Another way of saying that would be that it is the value for which 25% of the animals weigh that amount or more._
}

Besides looking at the median as center, and the spread between Q1 and Q3, we also gain valuable information from the spread of the entire dataset — that is, the distance between minimum and maximum. This is called the @vocab{range of a dataset}. (*Note*: the term “Range” means something different in statistics than it does in algebra and programming!)

Splitting a dataset into quarters gives us five numbers that we can use to measure spread: the minimum, the maximum and the three quartiles that split the dataset into quarters.

. @vocab{Minimum}: _the smallest value in a dataset - it starts the first quarter_
. Q1 (lower quartile): _the number that separates the first quarter of the data from the second quarter of the data_
. Q2: @vocab{Median}: _the middle value (median) in a dataset_
. Q3 (upper quartile): _the value that separates the third quarter of the data from the last_
. @vocab{Maximum}: _the largest value in a dataset - it ends the fourth quarter of the data_

Taken together these are called the **5 Number Summary** of a dataset, and this summary is one tool for calculating spread. We can use these numbers to calculate two new values:

- _@vocab{Range}_ :  _the distance spanned by the extreme values in the dataset_
** Maximum - Minimum
- @vocab{IQR}:  _the @vocab{Interquartile Range}, or the distance spanned by the middle half of the data_
** Q3 - Q1

=== Investigate
We can use @vocab{box plots} to visualize the 5 number summary, the Range, and the Interquartile Range.

@ifproglang{pyret}{
Below is the Contract for `box-plot`, along with an example that will make a box plot for the `pounds` column in the `animals-table`.

```
box-plot :: (t::Table, col::String) -> Image
# Consumes a table and the name of the column
# to plot, and produces a box plot
box-plot(animals-table, "pounds")
```
}

@ifproglang{codap}{To create a box plot in CODAP, create a graph of randomly distributed points, then drag a quantitative column to the x-axis. From the `Measure` menu, select Box Plot. *If this information is not on your Data Displays Organizer, add it now!*}

@lesson-point{
Box plots divide our sample into four equally populated groups, and show which of those groups are spread wide or are tightly packed.}

@lesson-instruction{
@ifproglang{pyret}{
Type `box-plot(animals-table, "pounds")` into the Interactions Area, and see the resulting plot.

@lesson-instruction{
* Then turn to @printable-exercise{measures-of-center/pages/summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}
* Fill in the five-number summary for the `pounds` column, and sketch the box plot.
* What conclusions can you draw about the distribution of values in this column?
** _While the animals' weights range from 0.1 pounds to 172 pounds, 50% of the animals weigh 11.3 pounds or less. The animal that weighs 172 pounds may be an outlier._
}

@teacher{If students are struggling to write conclusions, go over the following five number summary from the box plot they made.}

- **Minimum** (the left “whisker”) - the smallest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s just 0.1 pounds.
- **Q1** (the left edge of the box) - computed by taking the _median of the lower half of the values_. In the pounds column, that’s 3.9 pounds.
- **Q2** / Median value (the line in the middle), which is the middle Quartile of the whole dataset. We already computed this to be 11.3 pounds.
- **Q3** (the right edge of the box), which is computed by taking the _median of the upper half of the values_. That’s 60.4 pounds in our dataset.
- **Maximum** (the right “whisker”) - the largest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s 172 pounds.

@lesson-instruction{
* Turn to @printable-exercise{measures-of-center/pages/summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}
* Fill in the five-number summary for the `pounds` column, and sketch the box plot.}

@QandA{
@Q{What conclusions can you draw about the distribution of values in this column?}
@A{While the animals' weights range from 0.1 pounds to 172 pounds, 50% of the animals weigh 11.3 pounds or less. The animal that weighs 172 pounds may be an outlier.}
}

=== Common Misconceptions
It is extremely common for students to forget that every quartile _always_ includes 25% of the dataset. This will need to be heavily reinforced.

== Interpreting Box Plots @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to read a box plot, and consider spread and variability. They connect this visualization of spread to what they learned about histograms.

=== Launch
Just as @ifproglang{pyret}{pie}@ifproglang{codap}{dot plots} and bar charts are ways of visualizing categorical data, box plots and histograms are both ways of visualizing the shape of quantitative data.

Box plots make it easy to see the 5-number summary, and compare the Range and Interquartile Range. Histograms make it easier to see skewness and more details of the shape, offering more granularity when using smaller bins.

Left-skewness is seen as a long tail in a histogram. In a box plot, it's seen as a longer left "whisker" or more spread in the left part of the box. Likewise, right skewness is shown as a longer right "whisker" or more spread in the right part of the box.

@lesson-point{
Box plots and histograms give us two different views on the concept of shape.
}

|===
|               | Intervals | Points-per-Interval
| **Box Plots** | Variable  | Fixed
| **Histograms**| Fixed     | Variable
|===

*Histograms:* fixed intervals (“bins”) with variable numbers of data points in each one. Points “pile up in bins”, so we can see how many are in each. __Larger bars show where the clusters are.__

*Box plots:* variable intervals (“quartiles”) with a fixed number of data points in each one. Treats data more like “pizza dough”, dividing it into four equal quarters showing where the data is tightly clumped or spread thin. __Smaller intervals show where the clusters are.__

@strategy{
@span{.title}{Kinesthetic Activity}

Divide the class into groups, and give each group a ruler and a ball of playdough. Have them draw a number line from 0-6 with the ruler, marking off the points at 0, 3, 4, 4.5 and 6 inches. Have the groups roll the dough into a thick cylinder, divide that cylinder in half, and then split each half to form four __equally-sized cylinders__. The playdough represents a @vocab{sample}, with values divided into four quarters.

Box plots stretch and squeeze these equal quarters of the data across a number line, so that they fit into their respective intervals. On their number line, students have intervals from 0-3, 3-4, 4-4.5, and 4.5-6. Have students shape their cylinders into rectangles that fill each of these intervals, and are all about 1 inch thick.

Students should notice that the playdough is __taller for shorter intervals__ and thinner for longer intervals. Even though a box plot doesn't show us the thickness of the data points, we know that a small interval has the same amount of data "squeezed" into it as a large interval has spread across it.

@strategy{

@span{.title}{Modified Box Plots}
More Statistics- or Math-oriented classes will also be familiar with __modified box plots__ (@link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm_852R8JPw, video explanation}), which remove outliers from the box-and-whisker and draw them as asterisks outside of the plot.

@ifproglang{pyret}{Modified box plots are also available in Bootstrap:Data Science, using the following Contract:

@show{(contract 'modified-box-plot '((table-name Table) (column String)) "Image")}
}

@ifproglang{codap}{In CODAP, you can create a modified Box Plot by selecting both Box Plot and Show Outliers from the `Measure` menu.}

@lesson-instruction{
You've learned about @vocab{quartiles}, max and min, @vocab{interquartile range}, and more. With a partner, complete the @printable-exercise{boxplot-vocab-map.pdf, Box Plot Vocab Concept Map} and see if you can draw connections between these concepts!
}

=== Synthesize
Histograms, box plots, and measures of center and spread are all different ways to get at the @vocab{shape} of our data. It's important to get comfortable using every tool in the toolbox when discussing shape!

We started talking about measures of center with a single question: __is "average" the right measure to use when talking about animals' weights?__ Now that we've explored the spread of the dataset, do you agree or disagree that average is the right summary?

@ifproglang{pyret}{

@span{.title}{Project Option: Stress or Chill?}

Students can gather data about their own lives, and use what they've learned in the class so far to analyze it. @opt-project{stress-project.html, rubric-stress-or-chill.adoc} can be used as a mid-term or formative assessment, or as a capstone for a limited implementation of Bootstrap:Data Science.

== Data Exploration Project (Box Plots) @duration{flexible}

=== Overview
Students apply what they have learned about box plots to their chosen dataset. They will add three items to their @starter-file{exploration-project}: (1) at least two box plots, (2) the corresponding five-number summaries, and (3) any interesting questions they develop. To learn more about the sequence and scope of the Exploration Project, visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration}. For teachers with time and interest, @lesson-link{project-research-paper} is an extension of the Dataset Exploration, where students select a single question to investigate via data analysis.

=== Launch

Let’s review what we have learned about making and interpreting box plots.

@lesson-instruction{
- Does a box plot display categorical or quantitative data? How many columns of data does a box plot display?
** _Box plots display a single column of quantitative data._
- How are box plots similar to histograms? How are they different?
** _Box plots and histograms give us two different views on the concept of shape. Histograms have fixed intervals ("bins") with variables numbers of data points in each one. Boxplots have variable intervals ("quartiles") with a fixed number of data points in each one._
- Building a box plot creates a five-number summary. What does the five-number summary tell us about the column?
** _The five-number summary includes the minimum, medium, and maximum. It also includes the median of the lower half of the values, and the median of the upper half of the data points._
}

=== Investigate

Let’s connect what we know about box plots to your chosen dataset.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your chosen dataset starter file in @proglang.
** _Teachers: Students have the opportunity to choose a dataset that interests them from our @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.adoc, "List of Datasets"} in the @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset} lesson._
- Remind yourself which two columns you investigated in the @lesson-link{measures-of-center} lesson and make a box plot for one of them.
- What question does your display answer?
** _Possible responses: How is the data for a certain column distributed? Are the values close together or really spread out? Are their any outliers?_
- Now, write down that question in the top section of @printable-exercise{data-cycle-quantitative.adoc}
- Then, complete the rest of the data cycle, recording how you considered, analyzed and interpreted the question.
- Repeat this process for the other column you explored before (and any others you are curious about).
** _Note: If students want to investigate new columns from their dataset, they will need to copy/paste additional Measures of Center and Spread slides into their Explorartion Project and calculate the mean, median and modes for the new columns._
}

@teacher{Confirm that all students have created and understand how to interpret their box plots. Once you are confident that all students have made adequate progress, invite them to access their @starter-file{exploration-project} from Google Drive.}

@lesson-instruction{
- *It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*
- Find the box plot slide in the "Making Displays" section and copy/paste your first box plot here. Duplicate the slide to add your other box plots.
- Add the five-number summaries from these plots to the corresponding "Measures of Center and Spread" slides. 
- Be sure to also add any interesting questions that you developed while making and thinking about box plots to the "My Questions" slide at the end of the deck.
