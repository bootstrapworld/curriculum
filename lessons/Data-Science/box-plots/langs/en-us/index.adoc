== The Five-Number Summary

=== Overview

Students learn about how to use range, quartiles, and interquartile range to talk about variability.

=== Launch

The three dot plots shown below are differently sized samples drawn from the *same dataset*. _Each of the three samples has a median of 60._

[cols="^.^1a,^.^1a"]
|===

| @image{images/dot-plot-1.png}
| @image{images/dot-plots-2-3.png}

|===

@QandA{

@Q{What do the three dot plots have in common?}
@A{They have the same median. They represent the same dataset.}

@Q{How are the three dot plots different?}
@A{Each dot plot has a different spread and a different shape. There are different peaks, gaps, and outliers.}
}

@slidebreak

Yes, each of these plots has a median of 60... but the samples are quite different in nature--something we can plainly see with our eyes.

Statisticians sometimes characterize the distribution of data using what is known as a *five-number summary*. To compute a five-number summary, we must first arrange the data values from least to greatest. Then, we decompose a dataset into four equal parts, separated by @vocab{quartiles}. This process can offer us a more nuanced idea of how the data is spread out.

Here are the ingredients for a *5-number Summary*:

- @vocab{Minimum}: the smallest value in a dataset - it starts the first quarter
- Q1 (lower @vocab{quartile}): the number that separates the first quarter of the data from the second quarter of the data
- Q2 (@vocab{Median}): the middle value in a dataset
- Q3 (upper @vocab{quartile}): the value that separates the third quarter of the data from the last
- @vocab{Maximum}: the largest value in a dataset - it ends the fourth quarter of the data


Our quartiles allow us to calculate the @vocab{Interquartile Range}(@vocab{IQR}) - _the distance spanned by the middle half of the data_.  It is a more robust measure of variation than the range because it is less susceptible to @vocab{outliers}.  Seeing the relative size of the middle quartiles can be more useful than looking at data "on the edge". Mathematically, @math{IQR = Q3 - Q1}.

@slidebreak



=== Investigate 

@lesson-instruction{
- We are going to be looking at the data from 2 family gatherings.
  * The average age at the *Watson Family* gathering was *70.4 year old*.
  * The average age at the *Ledet Family* gathering was *44.3 years old*.
}  
@QandA{
@Q{What images do these statistics conjure in your mind? What do you imagine to be true about the ages of the people in attendance at each of the gatherings?}
@A{Answers will vary.}
@A{Some students will likely imagine that all of the people at both of the gatherings are adults.}
@A{Some students will likely expect that all of the people at the Watson Family Gathering were much older.}
}

@slidebreak

@teacher{
We are going to find the 5-number summary, range and IQR for 2 datasets. Future reflection will rely upon students having worked through both datasets. If your students tend to need more support, you may want to work with the first dataset as a class and then have students work with the second dataset independently.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's see what we can learn about how typical those averages were by looking at the datasets in the first section of @printable-exercise{distribution-by-hand.adoc}.
- Order the ages and compute the five-number summaries for both the *Ledet Family Reunion* and the *Watson Family Gathering*.
}


@teacher{
The partitioning of the data into four parts can be a challenge! Research by @citation{bakker-et-al-2005, "Bakker, Biehler, and Konold (2005)"} suggests that students do *not* tend to conceive of distribution in four parts, but three. (Their brains naturally view: the majority in the middle; lower values on the left; and higher values on the right!)

Annotating the list of ordered values can help students visualize the four groups. Emphasize that the median does *not* get included in the bottom or upper half of the data.

Ledet:

@center{@image{images/ledet-five-num.png, 400}}

Watson:

@center{@image{images/watson-five-num.png, 400}}

}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you notice and wonder about these datasets and the summary values you've just computed?}
@A{Students may notice that the maximum values are pretty close to each other, but the minimum values are very different from each other!}
@A{Students may notice that Q3 for both datasets is 72.}
@A{Students may notice that the median value for the Watson family data is a number that isn't in the dataset, whereas the median value for the Ledet family data is a number that's in the dataset.}
@A{Students may have questions about how to calculate the median and/or quartiles.}
}
 

@lesson-instruction{
- Practice computing five-number summaries from small datasets visualized as dot plots on @printable-exercise{match-dot-plots-summaries.adoc}.

}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{

@Q{What is a quartile?}
@A{One of the three boundary points that splits our dataset into four equal quarters.}

@Q{Why is the IQR a more robust measure of variability than the range?}
@A{Because it focuses on the middle half of the data, so is less susceptible to outliers.}

== Plotting our Five-Number Summary

=== Overview

Students plot five-number summaries as box plots before learning to make box plots in pyret.

=== Launch

To visualize the 5-number summary, the Range, and the Interquartile Range we can plot the five numbers on a number line and connect them to make a @vocab{box plot}. 

@ifslide{@image{images/box-n-whisker-plot.png, 500}}


@lesson-instruction{

- Let's try it together on Q1 of @printable-exercise{create-bp-from-dp.adoc}.

** First, make a vertical line on the number line for each of the 5 values of the five-number summary.
** Then make a box connecting Q1 to Q3. This box contains the middle half of the data (IQR).
** Make sure the line you drew for the median is tall enough to split the box into 2 parts (not necessarily equal!)
** Make a horizontal line (called a "whisker") connecting each end of the box to the minimum / maximum value. This helps us to visualize the full range of the data.

}


@teacher{

Verify that students have correctly plotted the first box plot on the page. Their solution should look like this:

@center{@image{images/dp-bp1-soln.png, 300}}

}

@QandA{
@Q{Which quarter of the data is packed densest? How do you know?}
@A{In the first box plot, the data is packed the densest in Q1. The first quarter is just 2 units long, but includes one fourth of the data.}

@Q{Which quarter of the data is the most dispersed? How do you know?}
@A{The data is the most dispersed in Q4. That quarter spans 11 units, and includes the same amount of data points as Q1.}

== Interpreting Box Plots - @proglang

=== Overview

Students learn to identify skewed and symmetric data from a box plot before exploring the spread of the "pounds" column in @proglang.

=== Launch

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

@ifslide{@image{images/even.png, 600}}

We know that when the points are evenly distributed across the range, the four sections of the box plot will be equal in size. But, it's very rare for the distribution of real world datasets to be uniform like this! _(And, even when we see a box plot with four equally wide quarters, we cannot assume that the points are evenly distributed within each of the quarters.)_ 

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

*What shapes are box plots likely to come in and how do we describe them?*

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

==== Symmetric 

The spread of any dataset with roughly the same amount of variation on the low end as on the high end can be described as symmetric. 

[cols="13a,13a,12a", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
| @image{images/even.png}
| @image{images/symmetriclong.png}
| @image{images/symmetricshort.png}
|===

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

An example of symmetric variation might be the weights of newborn babies: the distribution for those who are smaller than average might mirror those who are bigger than average.

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

==== Skew
Left and right skew are easy to identify from a quick glance at a box plot, by their longer whiskers trailing off toward the left or right, respectively. Longer whiskers indicate the potential of outliers.

[cols="^1a,^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|@image{images/left.png}
|@image{images/right.png} 
|===

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

An example of left skew could be:

- the weights of the cousins in a family, with the newborn as an outlier. +
_(Did you know that babies are supposed to triple their weight in the first year of their lives?!)_

Examples of right skew could include:

- the distribution of maximum heights reached during gymnastics floor routines, with Simone Biles as an outlier, reaching over 9 feet in the air!
- the distribution of time it takes to get from the subway to the street, with people using strollers and wheelchairs as outliers, because they have to wait for elevators while everyone else can use the stairs and escalators.

@QandA{
@Q{Now that we've explored the spread of the dataset, do you think the mean is the best measure of center for the animals' weights?}
@A{No. Most of the animals weigh far less than the average weight (of nearly 40 pounds)!}
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{If Q1 is the value for which 25% of the animals weighed that amount or less, what does Q3 represent?}
@A{The third quartile is the value for which 75% of the animals weighed that amount or less. Another way of saying that would be that it is the value for which 25% of the animals weigh that amount or more.}
@Q{Why do you think this visualization is sometimes called a "box and whisker plot"?}
@A{The distance between Min/Q1 and Q3/Max is drawn like whiskers!}
@Q{Could we make a box plot for every column in the dataset?}
@A{No. We can only make box plots for @vocab{quantitative} columns.}
}

@teacher{If students are struggling to write conclusions, go over the following five number summary from the box plot they made.

- *Minimum* (the left “whisker”) - the smallest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s just 0.1 pounds.
- *Q1* (the left edge of the box) - computed by taking the _median of the lower half of the values_. In the pounds column, that’s 3.9 pounds.
- *Q2* / Median value (the line in the middle), which is the middle Quartile of the whole dataset. We already computed this to be 11.3 pounds.
- *Q3* (the right edge of the box), which is computed by taking the _median of the upper half of the values_. That’s 60.4 pounds in our dataset.
- *Maximum* (the right “whisker”) - the largest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s 172 pounds.

@ifproglang{pyret}{
@strategy{Other Box Plots}{

If you're trying to compare two box plots, you might like them both to appear on number lines using the same scale.  Pyret has a function for the that:

@show{(contract 'box-plot-scaled '((table-name Table) (column String) (low-end Number) (high-end Number)) "Image")}

More Statistics-based or Math-oriented classes will also be familiar with _modified box plots_ (@link{https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=Cm_852R8JPw, video explanation}), which remove outliers from the box-and-whisker and draw them as asterisks outside of the plot. In Pyret, we can make them using the following contracts:

@show{(contract 'modified-box-plot '((table-name Table) (column String)) "Image")}
@show{(contract 'modified-box-plot-scaled '((table-name Table) (column String) (low-end Number) (high-end Number)) "Image")}

Finally, if you'd prefer to use vertical box plots, Pyret as the following contracts:

@show{(contract 'vert-box-plot '((table-name Table) (column String)) "Image")}
@show{(contract 'modified-vert-box-plot '((table-name Table) (column String)) "Image")}
@show{(contract 'modified-vert-box-plot-scaled '((table-name Table) (column String) (low-end Number) (high-end Number)) "Image")}

@teacher{Students may notice that the left part of the box is larger on the box plot B. Although that observation is correct, the box's larger area does *not* indicate that *more* data points are clustered there.

@strategy{Kinesthetic Activity}{

Divide the class into groups, and give each group a ruler and a ball of play-dough. Have them draw a number line from 0-6 with the ruler, marking off the points at 0, 3, 4, 4.5 and 6 inches. Have the groups roll the dough into a thick cylinder, divide that cylinder in half, and then split each half to form four _equally-sized cylinders_. The play-dough represents a @vocab{sample}, with values divided into four quarters.

Box plots stretch and squeeze these equal quarters of the data across a number line, so that they fit into their respective intervals. On their number line, students have intervals from 0-3, 3-4, 4-4.5, and 4.5-6. Have students shape their cylinders into rectangles that fill each of these intervals, and are all about 1 inch thick.

Students should notice that the play-dough is _taller for shorter intervals_ and thinner for longer intervals. Even though a box plot doesn't show us the thickness of the data points, we know that a small interval has the same amount of data "squeezed" into it as a large interval has spread across it.

*Matching Debrief: Think about shape, don't rely on numbers!*

There are teachers and students who complain about this page. They say that this page is unfair because we didn't label the axes. The stats teachers are always shocked at their colleagues. They say, "It doesn't matter! We're talking about shape. Skew right is skew right, no matter where it falls on the x axis.""

So many kids have sort of a statistical lazy eye. How do you fix that? You wear a patch over the strong eye. By removing the numbers, it forces people to think about the shape. If the numbers are there, you get high achieving algebra students who never learn shape because they keep using the numbers.

== Data Exploration Project (Box Plots)

=== Overview
Students apply what they have learned about box plots to their chosen dataset. They will add three items to their @starter-file{exploration-project}: (1) at least two box plots, (2) the corresponding five-number summaries, and (3) any interesting questions they develop. 

@teacher{To learn more about the sequence and scope of the Exploration Project, visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration}. For teachers with time and interest, @lesson-link{project-research-paper} is an extension of the Dataset Exploration, where students select a single question to investigate via data analysis.}

=== Launch

Let’s review what we have learned about making and interpreting box plots.

@QandA{
@Q{Does a box plot display categorical or quantitative data? How many columns of data does a box plot display?}
@A{Box plots display a single column of quantitative data.}

@Q{How are box plots similar to histograms? How are they different?}
@A{Box plots and histograms give us two different views on the concept of shape. Histograms have fixed intervals ("bins") with variable numbers of data points in each one. Box plots have variable intervals ("quartiles") with a fixed number of data points in each one.}

@Q{A box plot lets us visualize the five-number summary. What does the five-number summary tell us about the column of data?}
@A{The five-number summary includes the minimum, medium, and maximum. It also includes the median of the lower half of the values, and the median of the upper half of the data points.}
}

=== Investigate

Let’s connect what we know about box plots to your chosen dataset.

@teacher{Students have the opportunity to choose a dataset that interests them from our @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.adoc, "List of Datasets"} in the @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset} lesson.

@QandA{
@Q{What question does your visualization answer?}
@A{Possible responses: How is the data for a certain column distributed? Are the values close together or really spread out? Are there any outliers?}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Now, write down that question in the top section of @printable-exercise{data-cycle-quantitative.adoc}
- Then, complete the rest of the data cycle, recording how you considered, analyzed and interpreted the question.
- Repeat this process for the other column you explored before (and any others you are curious about).

@teacher{If students want to investigate new columns from their dataset, they will need to copy/paste additional Measures of Center and Spread slides into their Exploration Project and calculate the mean, median and modes for the new columns.

Confirm that all students have created and understand how to interpret their box plots. Once you are confident that all students have made adequate progress, invite them to access their @starter-file{exploration-project} from Google Drive.

@lesson-instruction{
- *It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*
- Find the box plot slide in the "Making Visualization" section and copy/paste your first box plot here. Duplicate the slide to add your other box plots.
- Add the five-number summaries from these plots to the corresponding "Measures of Center and Spread" slides. 
- Be sure to also add any interesting questions that you developed while making and thinking about box plots to the "My Questions" slide at the end of the deck.

=== Synthesize

- What @vocab{shape} did you notice in your box plots?

- Did you discover anything surprising or interesting about your dataset?

- What, if any, outliers did you discover when making box plots?

- When you compared your findings with others, did you make any interesting discoveries? (For instance: Did everyone find outliers? Was there more or less similarity than expected?)
