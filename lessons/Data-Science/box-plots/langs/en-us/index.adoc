== How Typical is the Average? @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the notion of _spread_ in a dataset. They learn about how to use range, quartiles, and interquartile range to talk about variation.

=== Launch
When we explored measures of center, _we determined that the average pet weighs almost 40 pounds_.

Once we've calculated our summary value, it's important to ask: _How typical is the average?_ +
We'd expect points to deviate from the mean in any sample!

@QandA{
@Q{Does the average tell us the "typical" weight of animals at the shelter?}
@A{Maybe!
- Perhaps all of the pets weigh between 35 and 45 pounds, with every pet close to the mean. 
- But perhaps all of the pets are super small or huge, and none are anywhere _near_ the mean!
}
}

@slidebreak

To learn about how evenly distributed the data is we can start by ordering the data from least to greatest. From there we can identify and a compute a number of values that will give us more information.

@slidebreak

==== Range

The @vocab{Range of a Dataset}, is the simplest measure of variation we can compute. It is the distance between the @vocab{Minimum} (lowest value) and @vocab{Maximum} (highest value). @ifslide{ +
}_(Note: the term “Range” means something different in statistics than it does in algebra and programming!)_


@indented{@math{Range = Maximum - Minimum}}

It is important that we consider the @vocab{Range of a Dataset} in context. 

- _10 years would be a huge age range in an elementary school classroom where all of the students are typically born within the same calendar year and less than 13 years old._  
- _But 10 years would be a narrow age range for Cypress trees growing in Louisiana swamps, some of which are 1500 years old._

@slidebreak

==== Quartiles

As we know from our work with @lesson-link{measures-of-center}, the @vocab{median} is the value that splits the data in half. If it diverges significantly from the mean, the data is skewed.

We can learn more about the distribution by splitting each of the halves of data in half so that we have four equal-sized quarters of data.  The boundary points between the equal quarters of data are called @vocab{quartiles}. 

If the first quartile does not fall in the middle between the minimum and the median, we know that the data is not evenly distributed. The same is true if the third quartile does not fall in the middle between the maximum and the median.

@slidebreak

==== Interquartile Range (IQR)

Our quartiles allow us to calculate the @vocab{Interquartile Range}(@vocab{IQR}) - _the distance spanned by the middle half of the data_.  It is a more robust measure of variation than the range because it is less susceptible to @vocab{outliers}.  Seeing the relative size of the middle quartiles can be more useful than looking at data "on the edge".

@indented{@math{IQR = Q3 - Q1}}

@slidebreak 

==== Five-Number Summary

The *5-number Summary* combines the @vocab{quartiles} with the @vocab{minimum} and the @vocab{maximum}: 

- Minimum: _the smallest value in a dataset - it starts the first quarter_
- Q1 (lower quartile): _the number that separates the first quarter of the data from the second quarter of the data_
- Q2 (Median): _the middle value (median) in a dataset_ 
- Q3 (upper quartile): _the value that separates the third quarter of the data from the last_
- Maximum: _the largest value in a dataset - it ends the fourth quarter of the data_

If the data is evenly distributed these 5 numbers will be spaced at consistent intervals, but if the data is clustered, we will see some of these numbers be closer together than others.

=== Investigate 

@lesson-instruction{
- We are going to be looking at the data from 2 family gatherings.

}  
@QandA{
@Q{What images do these statistics conjure in your mind? What do you imagine to be true about the ages of the people in attendance at each of the gatherings?}
@A{Answers will vary.}
@A{Some students will likely imagine that all of the people at both of the gatherings are adults.}
@A{Some students will likely expect that all of the people at the Watson Family Gathering were much older.}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you notice and wonder about these datasets and the summary values you've just computed?}
@A{Students may notice that the maximum values are pretty close to each other, but the minimum values are very different from each other!}
@A{Students may notice that Q3 for both datasets is 72.}
@A{Students may notice that the median value for the Watson family data is a number that isn't in the dataset, whereas the median value for the Ledet family data is a number that's in the dataset.}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{

@Q{What is a quartile?}
@A{One of the three boundary points that splits our dataset into four equal quarters.}

@Q{Why is the IQR a more robust measure of variation than the range?}
@A{Because it focuses on the middle half of the data, so is less susceptible to outliers.}

== Box Plots - Displaying our Five-Number Summary

=== Overview

Students plot five-number summaries as box plots before learning to make box plots in pyret.

=== Launch

To visualize the 5-number summary, the Range, and the Interquartile Range we can plot the five numbers on a number line and connect them to make a @vocab{box plot}. 

- First, make a vertical line on the number line for each of the 5 points.
- Then make a box connecting Q1 to Q3. This box contains the middle half of the data (IQR). 
- Make sure the line you drew for the median is tall enough to split the box into 2 parts (not necessarily equal!)
- Make a horizontal line (called a "whisker") connecting each end of the box to the minimum / maximum value. This helps us to visualize the full range of the data. 

@ifslide{@image{images/box-n-whisker-plot.png, 500}}

@slidebreak

Box plots display how the four equal quarters of data are spread out along the number line.

@ifnotslide{@center{@image{images/box-n-whisker-plot.png, 500}}} 
@ifslide{@image{images/box-n-whisker-plot.png, 500}}

@lesson-point{No matter what shape the box plot has, all four sections contain _exactly the same number of points_.} 

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

When the points are evenly distributed, the four sections of the box plot will be equal in size, but _we will rarely see a box plot with four equal sections_!  

@ifslide{@image{images/even.png, 400}}

@slidebreak

When we see that some of the sections are narrow and others are wider, we know that the narrow sections are packed more densely. 

@ifslide{@image{images/box-n-whisker-plot.png, 500}}

@QandA{
@Q{Which quarter of data is packed the densest in this box plot?}
@A{The third one}
@Q{Which quarter of the data is the most dispersed in this box plot?}
@A{The fourth one}
}

=== Investigate

@teacher{@opt{If you printed and distributed copies of @opt-printable-exercise{distribution-by-hand.adoc}, direct students to complete the page now.
}}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's practice making box plots with the data from the family gatherings.
- Find the page where you recorded the 5-number summaries.
- Make a number line from 0 to 80, with labeled intervals every 10 years.
- Plot each of the values from the *Ledet Family* 5-number summary on the number line.
- Draw a box around the IQR (connecting Q1 to Q3 with a line for Q2 splitting the box into 2 sections)
- Draw whiskers connecting the box to the minimum and the maximum.
- Make a second number line from 0 to 80, with labeled intervals every 10 years.
- Use the *Watson Family* 5-number summary to make a box plot.

@Q{The average age at the *Ledet Family* gathering was *44.3 years old*.}
@Q{For which family was the average age more typical?}
@A{For the Watson family gathering because the data is more closely clustered, the Range and IQR are significantly smaller, and the mean and median are much more similar.}

@Q{How did making the box plots help you to understand the data?}
@Q{What else do you notice and wonder?}
}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Box plots have four sections. What has to be true about all of those sections?}
@A{They each have to contain exactly one quarter of the data, no matter how different the sections look on the number line.}

@Q{Why isn't the median always in the middle of the box?}
@A{Because the median has to split the data itself in half and the quarter of the data to the left of the median isn't necessarily clustered as tightly as the quarter of the data to the right of the median.}

@Q{What part of the box plot represents the Range?}
@A{The full width from the end of the left whisker to the end of the right whisker}
}

== Interpreting Box Plots - @proglang

=== Overview

Students learn to identify skewed and symmetric data from a box plot before exploring the spread of the "pounds" column in @proglang.

=== Launch

@slidebreak{InvestigateC}

We know that when the points are evenly distributed, the four sections of the box plot will be equal in size@ifnotslide{, like this}:

@ifnotslide{@centered-image{images/even.png, 400}}
@ifslide{@image{images/even.png, 600}}

But how do we describe the other shapes box plots come in?

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

Sometimes there is roughly the same amount of variation on the low end as on the high end. For example, the distribution of newborns who are smaller than average might mirror that of newborns who are bigger than average. We call this kind of spread symmetric. 

@teacher{Note: While even Distribution can also be correctly described as Symmetric, students should be encouraged to use more specific language for describing things when it's available to them.}

@ifnotslide{@centered-image{images/symmetric.png, 400}}
@ifslide{@image{images/symmetric.png, 800}}

@slidebreak

Left and right skew are easy to identify from a quick glance at a box plot, with longer whiskers trailing off toward potential outliers.

@A{No. Most of the animals weigh far less than the average weight (of nearly 40 pounds)!}
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{If Q1 is the value for which 25% of the animals weighed that amount or less, what does Q3 represent?}

@A{The distance between Min/Q1 and Q3/Max is drawn like whiskers!}

@A{No. We can only make box plots for @vocab{quantitative} columns.}
}

@teacher{If students are struggling to write conclusions, go over the following five number summary from the box plot they made.

- *Minimum* (the left “whisker”) - the smallest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s just 0.1 pounds.
- *Q1* (the left edge of the box) - computed by taking the _median of the lower half of the values_. In the pounds column, that’s 3.9 pounds.
- *Q2* / Median value (the line in the middle), which is the middle Quartile of the whole dataset. We already computed this to be 11.3 pounds.
- *Q3* (the right edge of the box), which is computed by taking the _median of the upper half of the values_. That’s 60.4 pounds in our dataset.
- *Maximum* (the right “whisker”) - the largest value in the dataset . In our dataset, that’s 172 pounds.

@strategy{Kinesthetic Activity}{

Divide the class into groups, and give each group a ruler and a ball of play-dough. Have them draw a number line from 0-6 with the ruler, marking off the points at 0, 3, 4, 4.5 and 6 inches. Have the groups roll the dough into a thick cylinder, divide that cylinder in half, and then split each half to form four _equally-sized cylinders_. The play-dough represents a @vocab{sample}, with values divided into four quarters.

Box plots stretch and squeeze these equal quarters of the data across a number line, so that they fit into their respective intervals. On their number line, students have intervals from 0-3, 3-4, 4-4.5, and 4.5-6. Have students shape their cylinders into rectangles that fill each of these intervals, and are all about 1 inch thick.

Students should notice that the play-dough is _taller for shorter intervals_ and thinner for longer intervals. Even though a box plot doesn't show us the thickness of the data points, we know that a small interval has the same amount of data "squeezed" into it as a large interval has spread across it.

*Matching Debrief: Think about shape, don't rely on numbers!*

There are teachers and students who complain about this page. They say that this page is unfair because we didn't label the axes. The stats teachers are always shocked at their colleagues. They say, "It doesn't matter! We're talking about shape. Skew right is skew right, no matter where it falls on the x axis.""

So many kids have sort of a statistical lazy eye. How do you fix that? You wear a patch over the strong eye. By removing the numbers, it forces people to think about the shape. If the numbers are there, you get high achieving algebra students who never learn shape because they keep using the numbers.
