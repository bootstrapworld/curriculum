= Create Box Plots from Dot Plots

Use the five-number summary to draw a box plot above the corresponding dot plot. When you're finished, identify which quarter(s) of the data are packed the densest, and which quarter(s) of the data are the most dispersed. The first row has been completed as a sample.
