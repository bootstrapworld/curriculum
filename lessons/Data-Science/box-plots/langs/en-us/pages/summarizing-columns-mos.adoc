== Summarizing the Pounds Column

Get the values to summarize the spread of the @fitb{20ex}{pounds} column of the @starter-file{animals}@ifproglang{pyret}{ by typing

@vspace{1ex}

@hspace{2em} `box-plot(animals-table, "pounds")` into the Interactions Area.
}

@ifproglang{codap}{by creating a Box Plot and hovering over the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum.}

@n My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===
| Minimum 	  	| Q1 			| Median 		| Q3 			| Maximum
| @ifsoln{0.10}	| @ifsoln{3.90}	| @ifsoln{11.3}	| @ifsoln{60.4} | @ifsoln{172}
@ifnotsoln{@vspace{2ex}}

@n Draw a box plot from this summary on the number line below. _Be sure to label the number line with consistent intervals._

@ifnotsoln{@centered-image{../images/numline.svg}}

@ifsoln{@centered-image{../images/boxplot.png}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n The *Range* is: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{171.9}} and the *Interquartile Range(IQR)* is: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{56.5}}.

@n From this summary and box plot, I conclude that:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{While the animals' weights range from 0.1 pounds to 172 pounds, 50% of the animals weigh 11.3 pounds or less.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The animal that weighs 172 pounds may be an outlier.}}
