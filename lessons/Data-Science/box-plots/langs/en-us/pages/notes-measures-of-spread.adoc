*Data Scientists measure the _spread_ of a dataset using a _five-number summary_:*

@vspace{1ex}

- @vocab{Minimum}: the smallest value in a dataset -- it starts the first quarter
- @vocab{Q1 (lower quartile)}: the number that separates the first quarter of the data from the second quarter of the data
- *_Q2 (@vocab{Median})_*: the middle value (or average of the 2 middles values) in a dataset
- @vocab{Q3 (upper quartile)}: the value that separates the third quarter of the data from the last
- @vocab{Maximum}: the largest value in a dataset -- it ends the fourth quarter of the data

@vspace{1ex}

The *five-number summary* can be used to draw a *box plot*.

- The left *whisker* extends from the minimum to Q1.
- The *box*, or *interquartile range*, extends from Q1 to Q3. It is divided into 2 parts by the *median*. Each of those parts contains 25% of the data, so the whole box contains the central 50% of the data.
- The right *whisker* extends from Q3 to the maximum.

In the box plot above, the *minimum* weight is ~165 pounds, the *median* weight is ~220 pounds, and the *maximum* weight is ~310 pounds.

- Each of the four sections of the box plot contains 25% of the data. In the box plot above, for example:

@indented{[cols="1a, 1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| 
1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 165 and 195 pounds

1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 195 and 220 pounds

1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 220 and 235 pounds

1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 235 and 310 pounds
|
Therefore... +
50% of the players weigh roughly between 165 and 220 pounds
50% of the players weigh roughly between 195 and 235 pounds
50% of the players weigh roughly between 220 and 310 pounds
|===
}
- If the values are distributed evenly across the range, the four sections of the box plot will be equal in width.
- Uneven distributions will show up as differently-sized sections of a box plot, as with the box plot above.
 * The densest concentration of players' weights is between 220 and 235 pounds.
 * The widest section of the box plot is between 235 and 310 pounds, so the heaviest 25% of the players weights are spread across a wider span. We don't know anything about how the weights fall within that span, however. For example, it might mean:

@indented{[cols="1a, 1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
.^| 
 * the weights of the players weighing between 235 pounds 310 pounds could be evenly distributed across the range
|@image{../images/even.png}

.^| 
 * 310 is an outlier
|@image{../images/outlier.png}

.^|
 * most of the players weighing over 235 pounds may weigh around 310 pounds
