*Data Scientists measure the _spread_ of a dataset using a _five-number summary_:*

@vspace{1ex}

- @vocab{Minimum}: the smallest value in a dataset - it starts the first quarter
- @vocab{Q1 (lower quartile)}: the number that separates the first quarter of the data from the second quarter of the data
- *_Q2 (@vocab{Median})_*: the middle value (median) in a dataset
- @vocab{Q3 (upper quartile)}: the value that separates the third quarter of the data from the last
- @vocab{Maximum}: the largest value in a dataset - it ends the fourth quarter of the data

@vspace{1ex}

The *five-number summary* can be used to draw a *box plot*.

- Each of the four sections of the box plot contains 25% of the data.
  * If the values are distributed evenly across the range, the four sections of the box plot will be equal in width.
  * Uneven distributions will show up as differently-sized sections of a box plot.
- The left *whisker* extends from the minimum to Q1.
- The *box*, or *interquartile range*, extends from Q1 to Q3. It is divided into 2 parts by the *median*. Each of those parts contains 25% of the data, so the whole box contains the central 50% of the data.
- The right *whisker* extends from Q3 to the maximum.

*The box plot above, for example, tells us that:*

- The minimum weight is about 165 pounds. The median weight is about 220 pounds. The maximum weight is about 310 pounds.
- The data is not evenly distributed across the range:
  * 1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 165 and 195 pounds
  * 1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 195 and 220 pounds
  * 1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 220 and 235 pounds
  * 1/4 of the players weigh roughly between 235 and 310 pounds
  * 50% of the players weigh roughly between 165 and 220 pounds
  * 50% of the players weigh roughly between 195 and 235 pounds
  * 50% of the players weigh roughly between 220 and 310 pounds
- The densest concentration of players' weights is between 220 and 235 pounds.
- Because the widest section of the box plot is between 235 and 310 pounds, we understand that the weights of the heaviest 25% fall across a wider span than the others.
  * 310 may be an outlier
  * the weights of the players weighing between 235 pounds 310 pounds could be evenly distributed across the range
  * or all of the players weighing over 235 pounds may weigh around 310 pounds.
