= Distribution of a Dataset

@n Based on the average ages below, what do you imagine to be true about these two family gatherings.

@center{
Average Age at Young Family Gathering: 70.4 @hspace{3em} Average Age at Smith Family Reunion: 44.3
}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The people at the Young Family Gathering were much older.}}

== Generating a Five-Number Summary

The ages of those in attendance at the *Young Family Reunion* were: 70, 68, 69, 72, 65, 75, 65, 78, 70, 72, 71, 70

@ifnotsoln{@vspace{2ex}}@ifsoln{From least to greatest: 65, 65, 68, 69, 70, 70, 70, 71, 72, 72, 75, 78}

@n Compute the following:

@fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{65}}{Minimum} 	@hspace{1em}
@fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{68.5}}{Q1}       @hspace{1em}
@fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{70}}{Median} 	@hspace{1em}
@fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{72}}{Q3}      	@hspace{1em}
@fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{78}}{Maximum}	@hspace{5em}
@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{10}}{Range} @hspace{1em} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{3.5}}{Interquartile Range (IQR)} 


== Box Plots - Visualizing Shape 

@n Plot the values from your 5-Number Summary for the *Young Family Reunion* on the number line below. Then draw a box around the IQR (connecting Q1 and Q3 with a line for the median dividing it into 2 sections) and draw whiskers to the minimum and maximum values to reveal the box plot.

@n Generate a box plot to display the distribution of the ages at the *Smith Family Gathering*: 1, 44, 3, 42, 46, 74, 75, 21, 74, 70, 40, 41, 45

@ifnotsoln{@vspace{2ex}}@ifsoln{From least to greatest: 1, 3, 21, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 70, 74, 74, 75}

@n Compute the Range and IQR for the *Smith Family Gathering*. @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{74}}{Range} @hspace{1em} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{41.5}}{Interquartile Range (IQR)} 

== Compare and Contrast

@n For which family gathering was the average age more typical? How do you know? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Young. Because the data is more tightly clustered.}}

@n What else do you Notice and Wonder about the data from these two family gatherings?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n We plotted both of these box plots on number lines with the same scale. Did that make sense?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Seeing both box plots on the same scale definitley makes them easier to compare, but it might be easier to read the precise values for the Young family data if we zoomed in on the range the data actually falls within.}}
