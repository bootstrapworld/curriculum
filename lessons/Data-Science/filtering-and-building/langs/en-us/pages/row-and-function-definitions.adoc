= Reading Row and Function Definitions

[.linkInstructions]
Open the @starter-file{table-functions} on your computer, save a copy, and click "Run".

@n What is the name of the Table defined on line 5?  @fitb{}{@ifsoln{shapes-table}}

@indented{How many columns does it have? @fitb{12em}{@ifsoln{4}} 	How many Rows? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{8}}}

@n What is the name of the Row defined on line 17? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{blue-triangle}}

@n What data type is `red-circle` defined as: a Number, String, Image, Boolean, Table, or Row?   @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Row}}

@indented{
Type `red-circle` into the Interactions Area. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the second row in the table}}

@fitb{}{}
}

@n In the space provided on lines 19 and 20, add new definitions for two more Rows from this table.

@n Read the Contract on line 22.

@indented{
What is the function's name? @fitb{12em}{@ifsoln{is-red}}
Domain?  @fitb{12em}{@ifsoln{Row}}
Range?@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}
}

@n Type `is-red(blue-triangle)` into the Interactions Area. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`false`}}

@indented{
Then use the function `is-red`, passing in a different row.
Explain what the `is-red` function does. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{looks up the color, and compares it to "red"}}
}

@n What other functions are defined in the starter file? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`is-polygon`, `is-triangle`, and `lookup-name`}}

@vspace{1ex} +
@vspace{1ex}

*For each of the remaining functions, read the code and try to guess what it does _before_ testing it out by passing in a Row.*

@n What does `is-polygon` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Looks up the value in the "polygon" column}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What does `lookup-name` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Looks up the value in the "name" column}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What does `is-triangle` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{checks to see if the value in the "name" column contains "triangle"}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Define two new functions: `is-green` and `is-blue`.

@vspace{1ex}

@star There is a hidden function called `draw-shape`. Try to use it. What is its Domain and Range? What does it do?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Takes in a row and draws the shape using the appropriate color}}

@fitb{}{}

@star How else could we define `is-polygon`, without using the `"polygon"` column at all?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We could define `is-polygon` to look up the number of corners and check if it's greater than zero.}}

@fitb{}{}
