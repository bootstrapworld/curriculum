= Reading Row and Function Definitions

[.linkInstructions]
Open the @starter-file{table-functions} on your computer, save a copy, and click "Run".

@n What is the name of the Table defined on line 5?  @fitb{}{@ifsoln{shapes-table}}

@n How many columns does it have?           @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4}}

@n What is the name of the Row defined on line 17? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{blue-triangle}}

@n Is `red-circle` a Number, String, Image, Boolean, Table, or Row?   @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Row}}

@n Type `red-circle` into the Interactions Area. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the second row in the table}}

@n In the space provided on lines 19 and 20, add new definitions for two more Rows from this table.

@n A Contract for a function is written on line 22. What is its name? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{is-red}}

@n What is its Domain?  @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Row}}

@n What is its Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}

@n What other functions are defined in the starter file?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`is-red`, `is-polygon`, `is-triangle`, and `lookup-name`}}

@n Use the function `is-red`, passing in a Row. For example, type `is-red(blue-triangle)`. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`false`}}

@n What does the `is-red` function do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{looks up the color, and compares it to "red"}}

@vspace{1ex}

*For the remaining functions, read the code and try to guess what it does _before_ testing it out by passing in a Row.*

@n What does `is-polygon` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Looks up the value in the "polygon" column}}

@n What does `lookup-name` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Looks up the value in the "name" column}}

@n What does `is-triangle` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{checks to see if the value in the "name" column contains "triangle"}}

@n Define two new functions: `is-green` and `is-blue`.

@star There is a hidden function called `draw-shape`. What is its Domain and Range? What does it do?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Takes in a row and draws the shape using the appropriate color}}

@fitb{}{}

@star Is there another way to define `is-polygon`, so that it doesn't use the `"polygon"` column at all?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We could define `is-polygon` to look up the number of corners and check if greater than zero.}}

@fitb{}{}
