= Advanced Table Manipulation in a Nutshell

You've seen that Pyret has special functions that we can use to manipulate Tables:

  * `sort` - consumes the name of a column and a Boolean value to determine if that table should be sorted by that column in ascending order
  * `row-n` - consumes an index (starting with zero!) and produces a row from a table
  * `filter` - consumes a _Boolean-producing function_, and produces a table containing only rows for which the function returns `true`
  * `build-column` - consumes the name of a new column, and a function that produces the values in that column for each Row

You've also seen the "Order of Operations" for things like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. *Is there an Order of Operations for manipulating tables?*

@vspace{2ex}

Suppose you have the following function defined:

@vspace{1ex}

`fun days-to-adopt(r): r["weeks"] * 7 end`

@vspace{1ex}

One of the Circles of Evaluation below will sort the table by the number of days it took for each animal to be adopted. *One of them will produce an error!* Can you figure out which one?

@vspace{2ex}

@show{(coe '(sort (build-column animals-table "days" days-to-adopt) "days" true))}

@vspace{2ex}

@show{(coe '(build-column (sort animals-table "days" true) days-to-adopt "days"))}

@vspace{2ex}

_We can't `sort` by a column that doesn't exist yet!_ In fact, we can't `filter` by that column either. When filtering and building tables, it's important to keep the order of operations in mind!
