= Putting it All Together 

[linkInstructions]
Open the @starter-file{putting-it-all-together} and *take a look at the helper functions* in the Definitions Area.

Write the names of those functions here: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`is-dog`, `is-cat`, `is-young`, `is-old`, `get-name`, `is-fixed`, `label`, `kilos`}}

== Filter and Building with our Helper Functions

@vspace{1ex}

_Example: Make a table of only dogs (define it as `dogs`)_ 

@fitb{}{`dogs = filter(animals-table, is-dog)`}


@n Make a table of only fixed animals (define it as `fixed`)

@fitb{}{`fixed =`  @ifsoln{`filter(animals-table, is-fixed)`}}


@n Make a table with a column called "sticker", containing a label for every animal

@fitb{}{`stickers =` @ifsoln{`build-column(animals-table, "sticker", label)`}}


@n Make a table of only fixed dogs (define it as `fixed-dogs`)

@fitb{}{`fixed-dogs =` @ifsoln{`filter(fixed, is-dog)`}}


@star Make a table of old, fixed dogs... with a "sticker" column! (define it as `sticker-table`)

@fitb{}{`sticker-table =` @ifsoln{`build-column(filter(fixed-dogs, is-old), "sticker", label)`}}


== Define Additional Helper Functions

@n Define a function called `is-lizard`, which consumes a `Row` of the animals table and _computes_ whether the animal is a lizard.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`fun is-lizad(r): r["species"] == "lizard" end`}}


@n Define a function called `months`, which consumes a `Row` of the animals table and divides the weeks by `4.435` to get the approximate equivalent number of months to adoption.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`fun months(r): r["weeks"] / 4.435 end`}}


@star Make a table with a "months" column (define it as `months-table`)

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`months-table = build-column(animals-table, "months", months)`}}


== Make Visualizations Using Your New Tables

@n Make a pie chart showing the sex of only fixed dogs.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`pie-chart(fixed-dogs, "sex")`}}


@n Make a dot plot showing the distribution of months to adoption.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`dot-plot(months-table, "months")`}}


@star Make a scatter plot of old, fixed dogs, comparing age to pounds using the "sticker" as the label!

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`scatter-plot(sticker-table, "sticker", "age", "pounds")`}}
