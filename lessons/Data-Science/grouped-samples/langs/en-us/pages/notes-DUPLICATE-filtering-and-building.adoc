= Defining Row Functions &amp; Using Table Functions

Pyret has special functions that we can use to manipulate Tables.

- In this course, the functions we’ll be using are

** `sort` - consumes the name of a column and a Boolean value to determine if that table should be sorted by that column in ascending order
** `row-n` - consumes an index (starting with zero!) and produces a row from a table
** `filter` - consumes a __Boolean-producing function__, and produces a table containing only rows for which the function returns `true`
** `build-column` - consumes the name of a new column, and a function that produces the values in that column for each Row

*Order Matters!* Table operations must be applied in the __appropriate order__. For example, trying to order a table by a column that hasn’t been built yet will result in an error.
