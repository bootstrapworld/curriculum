= Two Ways of Thinking about Variability

== Variability of Categorical Data

@indented{
[cols="^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===
| Sana's Groceries 			| Juliette's Groceries
| 12 apples and 1 banana 	| 4 peaches, 4 kiwis, 4 oranges, and 1 lime
|===
}

@n Which dataset has greater variability - Sana's groceries or Juliette's groceries? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample response: Juliette’s grocery bag has greater variability, as the items in her bag are more different from one another than the items in Sana’s bag.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n You ask a group of sixth grade students to respond to two different statements with either "true" or "false."

- Statement A: _I am in sixth grade._
- Statement B: _I am wearing blue today._

Which statement do you predict will produce greater variability? Explain. @fitb{}{}

== Variability of Quantitative Data

@n Someone looks at your class roster and says, _"In general, students in our class have the same number of letters in their first names."_ +
Do you agree or disagree? Explain your reasoning. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample response: I disagree. In reality, the data spreads out from 3 letters to 14 letters.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If all students had the same number of letters in their names, most or all of the name lengths would be equivalent.}}

@n Which dataset do you predict will have greater variability for a group of ninth graders who attend the same school - wake-up times on Wednesday or Saturday? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample response: Saturday wake-up times probably has greater variability.)}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@ifsoln{On a school day, everyone needs to wake up in time to get to school, but on Saturday, some students may choose to sleep in later.}}}

@n Below are the students' responses for their wake-up times on Wednesday versus Saturday. Was your prediction correct? Explain.

- Wednesday: 6:30, 6:15, 6, 6:45, 6:30, 5:45, 6:45, 6:30, 6:30, 6:15

- Saturday: 7:00, 8:00, 8:30, 6:30, 9:45, 10:30, 6:00, 5:45, 10:15, 9:30

== Designing Datasets with High and Low Variability

@n Make up two *categorical* datasets with 5 items, each.

@indented{
[cols="^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===
| Dataset with Low Variability			| Dataset with High Variability
| @vspace{3ex}							|
|===
}

@n Make up two *quantitative* datasets with ten quantities, each.

@indented{
[cols="^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===
| Dataset with Low Variability			| Dataset with High Variability
| @vspace{1ex}							|

}
