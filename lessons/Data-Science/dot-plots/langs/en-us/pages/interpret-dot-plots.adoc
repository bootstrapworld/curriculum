== Reading a Dot Plot

The dot plot on below is a name length data visualization created by a group of 25 students (*Group A*).

@vspace{1ex}

@center{@image{../images/names1.png, 250}}

@n What is the difference (in letters) between the longest and shortest name? @fitb{}{}

@n What is the most common name length?  @fitb{}{}

@n What fraction of students have first names that are 5 letters long? @fitb{}{}

== Interpreting Peaks, Clusters, Gaps, and Outliers

@n The distribution of the data is the way that it is spread out on the number line. One way to describe distribution is by identifying peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. As a class, label any peaks, clusters, gaps, or outliers on the dot plot *above*.

@n Let's think about what those peaks, clusters, gaps and outliers *tell* us about the dataset. In the dot plot above:

- the peak indicates that @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{4}} letters is the most common name length
- the cluster indicates that many students' names are @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{3-6}} letters
- the gaps tell us that, in this sample, no students have names that are @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{7}} letters or @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{10}} letters
- the outlier is @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{11}} letters, telling us that longer names are uncommon in this sample.

@n The dot plot below represents the name lengths of a different group of 25 students (*Group B*). Label its peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. What do the peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers tell you about the dataset?

| @fitb{}{@ifsoln{In group A, there is a peak at 4 letters, and many of the data points are clustered between }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{3 letters and 6 letters. That means many students have names that are 3-6 letters, especially }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{4 letters. There is a gap at 7 letters and 9 letters, so no one's names are that length.}}

== Typicality of Name Length Data


@n Would 6 letters be a good description of the number of letters in students' Group A? What about  Group B? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you think is a typical value in Group A? (There is more than one correct response.) Explain your reasoning. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}


@n Identify another value someone else might claim is typical of Group A. Why would they choose that value? @fitb{}{}
