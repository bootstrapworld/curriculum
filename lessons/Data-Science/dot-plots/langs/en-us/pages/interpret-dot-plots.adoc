= Interpreting Dot Plots

== Reading a Dot Plot

The dot plot on below is a name length data visualization created by a group of 25 students.

@center{@image{../images/names1.png, 300}}

@n What is the difference (in letters) between the longest and shortest name? @fitb{}{}

@n What is the most common name length?  @fitb{}{}

@n What fraction of students have first names that are 5 letters long? @fitb{}{}

@n True or False: No students have 10-letter names. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{True}}


@n The distribution of the data is the way that it is spread out on the number line. One way to describe distribution is by identifying peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. As a class, label any peaks, clusters, gaps, or outliers on the dot plot *above*.


== Interpreting Peaks, Clusters, Gaps, and Outliers


@n Let's think about what those peaks, clusters, gaps and outliers *tell* us about the dataset. In the dot plot above:

- the peak indicates that @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{4}} letters is the most common name length
- the cluster indicates that many students' names are @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{3-6}} letters
- the gaps tell us that, in this sample, no students have names that are @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{7}} letters or @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{10}} letters
- the outlier is @fitb{1em}{@ifsoln{11}} letters, telling us that longer names are uncommon in this sample.


@n The dot plot below represents the name lengths of a different group of 25 students. What you can conclude about the dataset based on its peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers?

== Typicality of Name Length Data


@n Would 7.5 letters be a good description of the number of letters in students' names in your class? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Responses will vary.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Emphasize for students that the middle of the x-axis is not necessary what's typical in a dataset.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you think is a typical value in this dataset? (There will likely be more than one correct response.) Explain your reasoning. @fitb{}{}

@n Identify another value someone else might claim is typical in this sample. Why would they choose that value? @fitb{}{}
