= Dot Plots: Distribution, Typicality, Variability


A *dot plot* (below) is a data visualization consisting of data points plotted along a number line.

On the dot plot (above), each data point represents one student in a sample. The position of the data point indicates how many minutes it takes for that student to get ready for school.

*Distribution of Data.* To describe the distribution of data--the way that it is spread out on a number line--it is helpful to locate any outliers, clusters, peaks, and gaps.

- A *cluster* is a group of data points that are close together. _Most of the data in the dot plot above is clustered from 10-60, meaning that most students spend between 10 minutes and an hour getting ready for school in the morning._
- A *gap* is an interval where there are no data points. _On the dot plot above, there is a gap from 60 to 90. In this sample, no one takes between 60 and 90 minutes to get ready._
- An *outlier* occurs when one data point is much larger or smaller than the other data points. _There is an outlier on the above dot plot at 90. One student requires much more time to get ready in the morning._
- A *peak* is the value(s) with the most data. _On the dot plot, 45 minutes is the most common amount of time spent getting ready for school._

*Typicality of Data*

- Typicality in a dataset is what we expect from a dataset. We can estimate typicality by looking for peaks and clusters in a dataset.

- In looking at the dot plot above, we might estimate that students typically spend 40 or 45 minutes getting ready for school.

*Variability of Data*

- *Variability* is how different or alike the data points are. In a quantitative dataset we can measure and describe the variability using range, interquartile range, and standard deviation.

- *Statistical questions* are questions that anticipate variability.

- "How many inches are in a foot?" does not anticipate variability. The answer is always 12.

- "In general, how tall are the students in your class?" does anticipate variability.
