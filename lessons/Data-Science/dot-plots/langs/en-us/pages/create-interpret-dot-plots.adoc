== Reading a Dot Plot

@n What is the difference (in letters) between the longest name and the shortest name? @fitb{}{}

@n What is the most common name length?  @fitb{}{}

@n What percentage of students have first names that are 5 letters long? @fitb{}{}

== Peaks, Clusters, Gaps, and Outliers in Name Length Data

@n The distribution of the data is the way that it is spread out on the number line. One way to describe distribution is by identifying peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. As a class, label any peaks, clusters, gaps, or outliers on dot plot 4A, below. Then, label dot plot 4B on your own.

@n The dot plots above are name length data visualizations created by two other groups of students. Describe what you can conclude about students' name lengths in group A and group B, discussing any peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. @fitb{}{}

@n Using the dot plot from the first section, describe what you can conclude about students' name lengths _in your class_, discussing any peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. @fitb{}{}

== Typicality of Name Length Data


@n Would 7.5 letters be a good description of the number of letters in students' names in your class? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@n What do you think is a typical value in this dataset? (There will likely be more than one correct response.) Explain your reasoning. @fitb{}{}
