== Reading a Dot Plot

@n What is the difference (in letters) between the longest name and the shortest name? @fitb{}{}

@n What is/are the most common name length(s)?  @fitb{}{}

@n What fraction of students have first names that are 5 letters long? @fitb{}{}

== Peaks, Clusters, Gaps, and Outliers in Name Length Data
