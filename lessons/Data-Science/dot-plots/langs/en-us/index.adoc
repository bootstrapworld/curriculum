== Dot Plots' Distribution and Typicality

@objective{make-dot-plots}
@objective{dot-plot-features}

=== Overview

Students create and interpret dot plots, learning new vocabulary to informally describe a dataset's distribution and typicality.

=== Launch

@teacher{Before class, decide if you want your students to create a communal dot plot (1) via live survey, or (2) via each student drawing their own data point on a shared display.

If you opt to do the live survey... FILL THIS IN.

If you opt to have each student draw a data point:  Draw or project a number line on a piece of chart paper or on the board. Your number line should start at zero and go up to 15 by ones. If you have a student with a name that is more than 15 letters, extend the number line accordingly.}

@lesson-instruction{

- Count how many letters are in your first name.
- Once you have counted, follow your teachers' instructions to do one of the following:
** Complete the live survey and watch our class data visualization appear and evolve.
** Line up at the board to draw a dot above the number of letters in your first name. You may stack dots, but try to keep them evenly spaced.

@image{images/number-line.png}

- Congratulations! Your individual name length is now represented in our class dot plot.
- Copy the class dot plot onto the top section of @printable-exercise{our-class-name-data.adoc}.
- Put @printable-exercise{our-class-name-data.adoc} aside for now. We will return to it later in the lesson.
}

@strategy{Dot Plots?!}{
If you teach students who are older than 10 or 11 years old, you may be asking yourself: Why dot plots? Aren't those a little elementary?

Students are generally successful interpreting dot plots (compared to, say, box plots and histograms) because on a dot plot, _individual cases are visible_. Educational research tells us that interpreting box plots and histograms is often difficult for students because they tend to view data as individual cases. Box plots and histograms only provide an _aggregate_ view.

To combat this challenge, @citation{bakker-et-al-2005, "Bakker, Biehler, and Konold (2005)"} recommend building a strong foundation with data visualizations where _individual cases are visible_. In short: don't gloss over dot plots! When introducing dot plots and histograms, the research recommends pairing the less-familiar aggregate data visualizations with their corresponding (familiar) dot plots as we do in this lesson and others.

=== Investigate


@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{interpret-dot-plots.adoc} and complete the first section: Reading a Dot Plot.
- Be prepared to discuss your answers with the class.
}

@teacher{Review students' responses as a class. Questions 1, 2, and 3 touch on three relevant concepts: range, mode, and proportional reasoning. }

Now that we are comfortable reading dot plots, we need a common vocabulary to discuss the data that they display. To describe the distribution of data--the way that it is spread out on a number line--it is helpful to locate any outliers, clusters, peaks, and gaps.

- A *cluster* is a group of data points that are close together.
- A *gap* is an interval where there are no data points.
- An *outlier* occurs when one data point is much larger or smaller than the other data points.
- A *peak* is the value(s) with the most data.

@lesson-instruction{

@center{@image{images/names1.png, 250}}

- Let's complete the second section of @printable-exercise{interpret-dot-plots.adoc} together using the data in the dot plot for Group A.
}
@QandA{
@Q{What peaks should we label?}
@A{There is a peak at 4.}

@Q{What clusters should we label?}
@A{There is a cluster from 3 to 6.}

@Q{What gaps should we label?}
@A{There are gaps at 7 and 10.}

@Q{What outliers should we label?}
@A{There is an outlier at 12.}

@Q{Now let's turn to question 5. What do those peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers tell us about the dataset?}
}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the third section with your partner.
}

@teacher{
Discuss and review students' responses. Students will complete the final section of @printable-exercise{interpret-dot-plots.adoc} after a brief class discussion on typicality.
}

Another way of describing data on a dot plot is to think about its typicality.

@QandA{
@Q{Let's think about the word "typical". Describe a "typical" morning for you.}
@A{Invite students' to share. Emphasize that "typical" is "the usual", or "what's expected", but it is not always a perfect predictor. It may be "typical" to eat breakfast at 7am, but there are probably days where you eat a little bit earlier or a little bit later - or even much earlier or much later!}

@Q{What does the word "typical" mean to you?}
}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the final section of @printable-exercise{interpret-dot-plots.adoc}.
}

@teacher{Review students' responses, emphasizing that there are multiple ways to decide what is typical in a dataset. You may want to highlight a few different and appropriate responses to highlight that we are simply _estimating_ typicality. Some students may have located the most common value (or mode), while others may have found the middle value (median), or the balance point of the data (mean).}

Let's read and interpret the dot plot representing *our* class' name length data.

@lesson-instruction{
- With a partner, complete @printable-exercise{our-class-name-data.adoc}.
}

@QandA{
@Q{In what ways was our class data similar to the data from Group A and/or Group B on @printable-exercise{interpret-dot-plots.adoc}?}

@Q{Was there anything that made our class data unique?}
}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{

@Q{When determining what value is typical, why was it helpful to consider peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers in the dataset?}
@A{A peak indicates a name length that is the most common--which is one way of thinking about what's typical.}
@A{There might be a cluster where most of the data falls, which would likely be where would locate what's typical.}
@A{If we want to find a balance point for all of the data (yet another way of thinking about what is typical), then we need to consider gaps and outliers.}

@Q{What were some of the different strategies you used to choose a typical value in the dataset?}
@A{This question is designed to prime students to recognize that what's typical generally exists at the center of the data. Students will likely identify the values that (approximately) represent the mean, median, and mode(s). It is fine if students are not yet able to recognize these measures of center, which they will explore during @lesson-link{measures-of-center}.}

== From Dot Plots to Histograms

@objective{dot-plot-v-histogram}

=== Overview

Students learn about histograms, considering how they are both similar to and different from dot plots.


=== Launch

A histogram is another data visualization commonly used to display quantitative data. Let's explore the ways that histograms are similar to and different from dot plots.

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{compare-dot-plots-histograms.adoc}.
- Complete the first section. Be prepared to share your responses.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you Notice about the dot plot (left) and the histogram (right), which both display distribution of weeks?}
@A{Possible responses: the histogram has bars that are touching; I can see that the gaps and peaks are in the same place; I can't see individual data points.}

@Q{What do you Wonder about the dot plot and histogram?}
@A{Possible responses: Why do we need two displays that are so similar? How do I read and interpret a histogram? What are histograms useful for?}

}


=== Investigate

Now, let's think more deeply about the sort of information that dot plots and histograms provide us.


@lesson-instruction{
- Use *only the dot plot* to answer the questions on the second section of @printable-exercise{compare-dot-plots-histograms.adoc}.
- Record your responses in the *dot plot* column of the table. If there is a question that you *cannot* answer, put an X.
}


Next, we'll use a histogram to answer the same questions.

@lesson-instruction{
- Return to @printable-exercise{compare-dot-plots-histograms.adoc}.
- Use *only the histogram* to answer the same set of questions. Record your responses in the *histogram* column of the table. If there is a question that you cannot answer, put an X.
}

@QandA{
@Q{Given that this is your first time interpreting a histogram: What questions do you have about reading a histogram?}

@A{Possible questions include:
- *How is this different from a bar chart?* Histograms show the distribution of quantitative data, not categorical. Histograms' bars cannot be reordered, as they allow us to see the shape of a dataset. We can reorder bars in a bar chart.
- *Are the values on the tick marks included in the bar?* On a histogram, each bar _includes_ the left-end value but not the right-end value.}
- *How was the size of the intervals (bins) determined?* This is a great question! But it's too big to tackle today. Bin size varies depending on the data being displayed. We will explore this and other questions about histograms in @lesson-link{histograms-visualize}.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Respond to the questions in the Reflection section of @printable-exercise{compare-dot-plots-histograms.adoc}.
}


@teacher{Invite students to share their responses, emphasizing the important idea that histograms display aggregate information rather than individual cases.}

@strategy{Histograms Don't Display Individual Data Points!}{

Dot plots and histograms have a lot in common... so why is interpreting histograms a challenge for many students?

According to research conducted by @citation{bakker-et-al-2005, "Bakker, Biehler, and Konold (2005)"}, students are inclined to view data as _individual cases_. Histograms, however, display _aggregate information_.

How do we prevent this misconception? The authors have two recommendations:

- Spend ample time learning about data visualizations _where individual cases are visible_ to establish a solid foundation.
- When aggregate plots *are* introduced, pair them with representations that allow students to see individual cases.

}

Lets think more deeply about dot plots and histograms, two data visualizations of both the frequency and distribution of quantitative data.

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{match-dot-plots-histograms.adoc}.
- What was your strategy for matching dot plots and histograms?
}



=== Synthesize


@QandA{

@Q{How are the two displays alike?}
@A{They both display the frequency and distribution of quantitative data. They both show the total number of values.}

@Q{How are the two displays different?}
@A{We can see individual points on the dot plot, but on the histogram, we just get a collective overview of the data. There is no way to single out one particular animal's weight on the histogram.}

@Q{When might a histogram be more useful than a dot plot? When might a dot plot be more useful than a histogram?}
@A{If we have a large dataset and we want to get a collective overview of the data, a histogram would be more useful. If we need to look at individual data points in a smaller dataset, we should use a dot plot.}
