= Design Recipe Wrap Up (Set 1 & 2 combined)

@n You should already have added these 4 definitions to your starter file:

@ifnotsoln{
```
fun is-dog(r): @fitb{48em}{} end
fun is-young(r): @fitb{47em}{} end
fun days(r): @fitb{49em}{} end
fun kilos(r): @fitb{49em}{} end
```
}

@ifsoln{
```
fun is-dog(r): r["species"] == "dog" end
fun is-young(r): r["age"] < 4 end
fun days(r): 7 * r["weeks"] end
fun kilos(r): 2.2 * r["pounds"] end
```
}

@n **Draw the Circles of Evaluation** for how you would combine the functions above to:

@indented{
__Make a scatter plot showing the relationship between kilograms of young dogs at the shelter, and how many days it took to be adopted.__
}

@do{
(define exp1 '(scatter-plot (build-column (build-column (filter (filter animals-table is-dog) is-young) "days" days) "kilos" kilos) "name" days" "kilos"))
}

@showsoln{(coe exp1)}

@ifnotsoln{@vspace{70ex}}

@n Translate the Circles of Evaluation above into the code you'll type into @proglang.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code exp1)}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Test out the expression you wrote above in the @starter-file{row-functions}. __(Be sure to add the definitions you wrote on the top of the page if you haven't done so already!)__ What do you learn?
