= Making Connections

[.linkInstructions]
Open the @starter-file{row-functions} on your computer, save a copy, and *Click "Run"*!

@n Write the code to lookup the value of the `weeks` column for each of the rows listed (the first one has been completed for you).

[cols="1a,4a", options="header"]
|===
| row           | code to lookup the value of the `weeks` column
| `cat-row`     | `cat-row["weeks"]`
| `young-row`   | @ifsoln{`young-row["weeks"]`}
| `old-row`     | @ifsoln{`old-row["weeks"]`}
|===

@n Write the code that uses the `circle` function to draw a solid, green circle whose radius is the _number of weeks_ it took to get adopted (the first one has been completed for you).

[cols="1a,4a", options="header"]
|===
| row           | code to draw a circle using the "weeks" of the row as the radius
| `cat-row`     | `circle(cat-row["weeks"], "solid", "green")`
| `young-row`   | @ifsoln{`circle(young-row["weeks"], "solid", "green")`}
| `old-row`     | @ifsoln{`circle(old-row["weeks"], "solid", "green")`}
|===

@n Check with your partner or another student to confirm that your code matches.

@n What is the name of the animal defined in `old-row`? @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{Felix}} How many weeks did it take for them to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{5}}

@vspace{1ex}

== weeks-dot

[.linkInstructions]
Scroll down in the @starter-file{row-functions} until you find the Contract, Purpose, Examples and Definition for `weeks-dot`.

@n What is the Domain of this function? @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{Row}} The Range? @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{Image}} How many examples does this function have? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4}}

@n Does the Purpose Statement make it clear what this function should do, when given a Row? @fitb{}{}

@n Look at the first two examples. How do they satisfy the Contract and Purpose Statement?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both examples show the function consuming one argument, and the Domain has one thing in it}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both examples make a solid, green circle using the animal's `weeks` to adoption}}

@vspace{1ex}

_These examples show us exactly what should be produced for `cat-row` and `young-row` - the two Rows representing "Sasha" and "Wade", based on their `weeks` to adoption (`1` and `3`). But they don't show us where the computer should get the number of `weeks` from!_

@n The last two examples do the same thing as the first two examples, but the numbers `3` and `1` have been replaced! + 
Where do they get the number of weeks from?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The numbers have been replaced by Row Lookups}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n How is the definition for the `weeks-dot` function connected to our examples?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The definition follows the pattern of the examples.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Add an example for `old-row` to match first pair of examples (using the actual number of weeks). Then add an example for the second pair (using a lookup).

@star Choose one more row that's defined at the top of the file, and add examples for that as well.
