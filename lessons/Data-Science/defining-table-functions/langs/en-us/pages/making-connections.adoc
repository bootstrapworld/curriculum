= Making Connections

_Open the @starter-file{row-functions} on your computer, save a copy, and *Click "Run"*!_

@n In the Interactions Area you should see some messages telling you that the tests passed. What do you think this mean?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are two functions defined in this starter file and each came with a list of examples.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The computer has confirmed that the examples work for their respective definitions.}}

== Defined Rows

@n Find the definition for `cat-row`. What do you get back when you evaluate `cat-row` in the Interactions Area? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{we see the row for Miaulis}}

@n How many weeks did it take for the animal in `cat-row` to be adopted? @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{4}} 

@n How many weeks did it take for the animal in `young-row` to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1}}

@vspace{1ex}

== weeks-dot

_Scroll down in the starter file until you find the Contract, Purpose, Examples and Definition for `weeks-dot`._ 

@n What is the Domain of this function? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{Row}} The Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Image}}

@n The @vocab{Purpose Statement} is a way of describing the function in detail. Does the Purpose Statement make it clear what this function should do, when given a Row? @fitb{}{}

@n How many examples do you see defined for this function? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4}}

@n Look at the first two examples. How do they satisfy the Contract and Purpose Statement?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both examples show the function consuming one argument, and the Domain has one thing in it}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both examples make a solid circle using the animal's `weeks` to adoption, and the purpose says to do that}}

[.indentedpara]
_These examples show us exactly what should be produced for `cat-row` and `young-row` - the two Rows representing "Sasha" and "Wade", based on their `weeks` to adoption. But they don't show us where the computer should get the number of `weeks` from!_

@n The last two examples do the same thing as the first two examples, without manually providing numbers. Where do they get the number of weeks from?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The numbers have been replaced by Row lookups}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n How is the definition for `weeks-dot` connected to our examples?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The definition follows the pattern of the examples.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Look at the Purpose, Contract, Examples, and Definition carefully - **there's a mistake**, where the Examples and Definition don't match the Contract and Purpose.

@vspace{1ex}

What's the mistake?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The purpose says purple, but all the examples and definition say green.}}

@center{**When you're done, fix the mistake in the code!**}
