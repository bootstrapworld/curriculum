= Sorting Histograms

With your partner, sort all of the cards into two piles: histograms that are approximately symmetrical, and histograms that are not approximately symmetrical. Then, follow the prompts and respond to the questions below.

== Symmetrical Histograms

_Put your asymmetrical cards aside (or back in their envelope)._

@n List out the letters of the histograms that were symmetrical: @fitb{}{}

@n Sort the symmetrical cards into two or three logical groups. _Hint: It may be useful to think about peaks, gaps, and clusters!_ What do the cards in your first group have in common? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do the cards in your second group have in common? (Describe your third group as well, if you have a third group.) @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Can you think of a different way of grouping these histograms? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Describe how you can determine what's typical of a symmetrical histogram.  @fitb{}{}
