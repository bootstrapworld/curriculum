= Visualizing the "Shape" of Data

@description{Students explore the concept of "shape", using histograms to determine whether a dataset has skewness, and what the direction of the skewness means. They apply this knowledge to the Animals Dataset, and then to their own.}

== Describing Shape @duration{30 minutes}

@objective{peaks-clusters-gaps}
@objective{skew-or-symmetric}
@objective{bar-chart-v-histogram}

=== Overview
This activity focuses on _describing shape_ based on a @vocab{histogram}. Students learn about "left skewed", "right skewed", and "symmetric" data, and what those descriptions tell us about a dataset.

=== Launch

@vocab{Shape} is one way to quickly describe what values are more or less common in a dataset. If you don't look at shape - where are the peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers - you lose a lot of insight into your dataset!

== Histograms and Measures of Center

@objective{histograms-and-measures-of-center}

=== Overview

Students combine apply their knowledge histograms, measures of center, and shape.

=== Launch

Can you compute and interpret different measures of center from a histogram? Let's try it.

@QandA{
The histogram below shows the number of children per home in Broadmoore neighborhood.

@image{images/number-children.png, 350}

@Q{What is the median number of children per home?}
@A{1. Students may mistakenly attempt to find the midpoint of the values on the horizontal axis, indicating that they connect median with “middle”, but misunderstand _what_ middle value to find. In this case, all of the raw data is available in the histogram.
}

@Q{What is the mean number of children per home?}
@A{Approximately 2.04. Note that students may attempt to use the “add up and divide” algorithm with inappropriate data values from the display. Students may mistakenly compute the mean height of the bars, or the mean of values on the horizontal axis.}
}

@teacher{Students often cannot compute measures of center from histograms because they _lack attention to the context of the data_. Cooper and Shore (2008) suggest that when students are confused, simply ask "What are the data?" to help reorient and redirect students. Similarly, urge students to discuss and defend their responses.}


=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Work with a partner to complete @printable-exercise{histograms-moc.adoc}.
- Which problem was the most challenging? Why did you find it challenging?
}

@teacher{
Discuss solutions with students. Highlight for students the misconceptions revealed by common incorrect responses. For instance, choosing "the modes are roughly the same" for the the first problem suggests that students understand the concept of mode, but looked at bar height (indicating frequency) instead of considering the value on the x-axis.
}



=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{How was interpreting mean, median, and mode from a histogram different than computing it from a raw dataset?}
@A{Responses will vary. Students should explain that they needed to understand the meaning of the bar height and the values on the x-axis in order to arrive at correct measures of center.}

@Q{Describe how the relationship between mean and median can help you draw a conclusion about the skewness of a histogram?}
@A{When the mean is greater than the median, outliers on the right cause the display to be skewed right. When the mean is less than the median, outliers on the left cause the histogram to be skewed left. }
}



== Data Exploration Project (Visualizing Shape) @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students apply what they have learned about visualizing shape to the histograms they have created for their chosen dataset. They will add to their @starter-file{exploration-project} a more detailed interpretation of their histograms using new vocabulary. 

@teacher{Visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration} to learn more about the sequence and scope. Teachers with time and interest can build on the exploration by inviting students to take a deep dive into the questions they develop with our @lesson-link{project-research-paper}.
}

=== Launch

Let’s review what we have learned about visualizing the shape of data.

@QandA{
@Q{Describe a histogram that is _skewed right_. Are its outliers high or low?}
@A{Values are clumped around what's typical, with low outliers.}

@Q{Describe a histogram that is _skewed left_. Are its outliers high or low?}
@A{Values are clumped around what's typical, with high outliers.}

@Q{Describe a histogram that is symmetric.}
@A{It’s just as likely for the variable to take a value a certain distance below the middle as it is to take a value that same distance above the middle.}
}

=== Investigate

Let’s connect what we know about visualizing the shape of the data to the histograms we created for your chosen dataset.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your chosen dataset starter file in @proglang.
- For this analysis, you'll want to look at the Data Cycle that you completed during the Histograms lesson.
- Recreate the histograms that you made before. Now, edit and expand your discussion so that it uses the new vocabulary that you've used.
}

@teacher{@opt{If your students who need a fresh copy of the Data Cycle template, distribute @opt-printable-exercise{data-cycle-quantitative.adoc}.}}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
*It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*

- For each of the histograms that you have added, edit and / or expand upon the interpretations you provided during the Histograms lesson.
- Be sure to integrate the new vocabulary we have learned, including: @vocab{shape}, @vocab{skewed left}, @vocab{skewed right}, and @vocab{symmetric}.
- Describe what this shape tells you about the quantitative column you chose.
}

=== Synthesize

@teacher{Have students share their findings.}

- What @vocab{shape}s did you notice in your histograms?
- Did you discover anything surprising or interesting about your dataset?
- Were there any surprises when you compared your findings with other students?
