= Visualizing the "Shape" of Data

@description{Students explore the concept of "shape", using histograms to determine whether a dataset has skewness, and what the direction of the skewness means. They apply this knowledge to the Animals Dataset, and then to their own.}

== Describing Shape @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
This activity focuses on _describing shape_ based on a @vocab{histogram}. Students learn about "left skewed", "right skewed", and "symmetric" data, and what those descriptions tell us about a dataset.

=== Launch

@vocab{Shape} is one way to quickly describe what values are more or less common in a dataset. If you don't look at shape - where are the peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers - you lose a lot of insight into your dataset!

=== Interpreting Shape

@right{@image{images/skew-right.png, 200}}

_The height of a histogram bar tells us how much data falls within that interval._ Taller stacks have more data points than short ones.

Look at the image on the right: most of the data is clustered on the left side, and there are a few unusually high values way off to the right. *But how do we describe this shape, and what does it mean?*

@slidebreak

Let's look at some real-world examples of the most common shapes:

*1. Skewed right, or high outliers*

@right{@image{images/right-w-foot.png, 300}}Most points are clumped around what’s typical, but they trail off to the right with a few unusually high values (or outliers). We see this shape often in the real world.

- The average US woman gives birth around age 26, but some do even after 45! No one is giving birth at age 7 to balance this out, so the outliers are all on the right.
- Personal income almost always shows right skewness or high outliers. There are usually a few billionaires that are far above average, and aren't balanced out by any earners that are equally far below average.

A skew-right distribution looks like the toes on your right foot!

@slidebreak

*2. Skewed left, or low outliers*

@right{@image{images/left-w-foot.png, 300}}Values are clumped around what’s typical, but they trail off to the left with a few unusually low values (or outliers).

- Most adults have close to a full set of 32 teeth, but a few hockey players might have a very small number of teeth. Since no one has _10 extra teeth_ to balance this out, the only outliers are on the left.
- A school cafeteria mostly buys canned goods in huge sizes, but might have a few ingredients in smaller sizes. If we looked at the ounces per can we’d see a shape that has left skewness and/or low outliers.

A skew-left distribution will look like the toes on your left foot!

@slidebreak

*3. Symmetric: values are balanced on either side of the middle.*

@right{@image{images/symmetric.png, 300}}In a @vocab{symmetric} distribution, it’s just as likely for the variable to take a value a certain distance below the middle as it is to take a value that same distance above the middle. Examples:

- It’s just as likely for a newborn baby to be a certain number of ounces below @vocab{average} weight as it is to be that number of ounces above average weight.
- At many restaurants, the busiest dinner time is around 7pm. But there are always a few people who want to eat earlier or later.

@teacher{For those in an AP Stats class or full-year Data Science class, you may wish to include a discussion of other kinds of distributions (e.g. - normal/gaussian, unimodal, bimodal, etc..)}





@strategy{What Shape Makes Sense?}{
If time allows, here's a great way to get students walking around and thinking more deeply about distributions!

Using flip-chart paper or whiteboard space, designate poster-sized regions around the classroom titled "Symmetric", "Skew Left", and "Skew Right". You may want to have 2-3 of each, depending on the number of students and size of the classroom. Divide the class into teams, such that each group takes a region of the room.

Each team looks at the region they're in front of, and must (a) draw a histogram with that shape and (b) _brainstorm a sample that would likely result in that distribution_. Once each team has completed the task, the teams rotate to the next poster and brainstorm another sample. They complete this until every team has come up with at least one unique example for @vocab{symmetric}, @vocab{skew left}, and @vocab{skew right} distributions.

== Data Exploration Project (Visualizing Shape) @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students apply what they have learned about visualizing shape to the histograms they have created for their chosen dataset. They will add to their @starter-file{exploration-project} a more detailed interpretation of their histograms using new vocabulary. 

@teacher{Visit @lesson-link{project-data-exploration} to learn more about the sequence and scope. Teachers with time and interest can build on the exploration by inviting students to take a deep dive into the questions they develop with our @lesson-link{project-research-paper}.
}

=== Launch

Let’s review what we have learned about visualizing the shape of data.

@QandA{
@Q{Describe a histogram that is _skewed right_. Are its outliers high or low?}
@A{Values are clumped around what's typical, with low outliers.}

@Q{Describe a histogram that is _skewed left_. Are its outliers high or low?}
@A{Values are clumped around what's typical, with high outliers.}

@Q{Describe a histogram that is symmetric.}
@A{It’s just as likely for the variable to take a value a certain distance below the middle as it is to take a value that same distance above the middle.}
}

=== Investigate

Let’s connect what we know about visualizing the shape of the data to the histograms we created for your chosen dataset.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your chosen dataset starter file in @proglang.
- For this analysis, you'll want to look at the Data Cycle that you completed during the Histograms lesson.
- Recreate the histograms that you made before. Now, edit and expand your discussion so that it uses the new vocabulary that you've used.
}

@teacher{@opt{If your students who need a fresh copy of the Data Cycle template, distribute @opt-printable-exercise{data-cycle-quantitative.adoc}.}}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
*It’s time to add to your @starter-file{exploration-project}.*

- For each of the histograms that you have added, edit and / or expand upon the interpretations you provided during the Histograms lesson.
- Be sure to integrate the new vocabulary we have learned, including: @vocab{shape}, @vocab{skewed left}, @vocab{skewed right}, and @vocab{symmetric}.
- Describe what this shape tells you about the quantitative column you chose.
}

=== Synthesize

@teacher{Have students share their findings.}

- What @vocab{shape}s did you notice in your histograms?
- Did you discover anything surprising or interesting about your dataset?
- Were there any surprises when you compared your findings with other students?
