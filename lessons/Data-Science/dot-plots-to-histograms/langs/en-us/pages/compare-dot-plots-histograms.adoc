== Dot Plots versus Histograms
Answer the questions below using only the dot plot, and then only the histogram. If you cannot answer a question precisely, write "X".

| Question
| Dot Plot
| Histogram

| @n How many animals were in the shelter for fewer than 10 weeks?
| @ifsoln{29}
| @ifsoln{29}

| @n How many animals were in the shelter for exactly 30 weeks?
| @ifsoln{1}
| @ifsoln{x}

| @n What is the longest amount of time that an animal stayed in the shelter?
| @ifsoln{30 weeks}
| @ifsoln{x}

| @n How many animals were in the shelter for at least 5 weeks but not more than 25? | @ifsoln{13}
| @ifsoln{13}

| @n Are there any gaps in the data?
| @ifsoln{11-22, 24-29}
| @ifsoln{15-19, 25-29}

| @n Are there any peaks in the data?
| @ifsoln{at 5}

@n When you answered the questions using the dot *plot*:

... Which questions were *easy* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{3, 4, 6}}
... Which questions were *hard* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{2, 5}}
... Which questions were *impossible* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{none}}

@n When you answered the questions using the *histogram*:

... Which questions were *easy* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{2, 5}}
... Which questions were *hard* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{6}}
... Which questions were *impossible* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{3, 4}}

@n When might a histogram be more useful than a dot plot?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A histogram would be more useful for a very large dataset,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{where you want to identify trends rather than look at}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{individual data points.}}
