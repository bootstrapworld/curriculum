= Making Histograms

== By Hand

Suppose we have a dataset for a group of 50 adults, showing the number of teeth each person has...

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
@big{
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 22, 26, 27, 28, 28, 28, 28, 29, 29, 29, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 31, 31, 31, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32
}
}

@n Use the data to complete the frequency table below. (The last cell has been completed for you.)

[cols="2a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a", options= "header", stripes ="none"]
|===
| number of teeth 	| 0-4 		| 5-9 		| 10-14 	| 15-19 	| 20-24		| 25-29  	|30-34
| frequency			| @ifsoln{4}| @ifsoln{0}| @ifsoln{0}| @ifsoln{0}| @ifsoln{1}| @ifsoln{9}| 35
|===

@n Use the frequency table to draw a histogram below, filling in each interval so that its height is equal to the frequency.

== In @proglang

@link-instructions{
Open the @starter-file{tooth-data}. Make a copy@ifproglang{pyret}{, and click "Run"}.
}


@n @ifproglang{pyret}{Type `tooth-table` in the Interactions window. Press enter.} @ifproglang{codap}{Look at the table that appears in the starter file.} What do you see? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The tooth data from above, with names!}}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
@n Type `count(tooth-table, "num-teeth")` in the Interactions window and press enter. How is the frequency table created in Pyret different from the one that you created, above? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Different intervals were used.}}

@fitb{}{}
}

@n What bin sized was used for @ifproglang{pyret}{the Tooth Data frequency table and} the histogram above? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{5}}

@n @ifproglang{pyret}{Evaluate `tooth-table`.}@ifproglang{codap}{Review the tooth table.} How does this data compare to the tooth data that appeared in the first section? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Same.}}


@n @ifproglang{pyret}{Use the contract below to build a histogram in Pyret of the distribution of teeth.

@show{(contract 'histogram '((table-name Table) (labels String) (values String) (bin-size Number)) "Image")}
}

@ifproglang{codap}{Drag `Num Teeth` to the x-axis and select Group into Bins from the Configuration menu. Fuse dots into bars, then enter the desired bin width of 5.}

@n How does the histogram you created in @proglang look _similar_ to the one that you drew? Are there any ways in which the histogram you created in @proglang is _different_ than the one you created by hand? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{On the histogram I created, intervals are labeled with the minimum and maximum value.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In @proglang, there are tick marks on the x-axis every 5 units.}}

@fitb{}{}
