== Did she swallow a fly?

@n Let's say we want to know the likelihood that the old lady "swallowed a fly". We need a ratio!

@vspace{1ex}


@math{p(fly | swallowed a) =} @math{\frac{c(swallowed a fly)}{c(swallowed a...)} = {\frac{}{12}}}

@vspace{1ex}

Put another way: To compute the probability that "fly" follows "swallowed a", we divide 4 (how many times we see "swallowed a fly") by 12 (how many times we see "swallowed a...")

@vspace{1ex}

The likelihood that the old lady "swallowed a fly" in the excerpt is 33%.

== Did she swallow a... ?

@vspace{1ex}

@math{p(spider | swallowed a) =} @math{\frac{c(swallowed a spider)}{c(swallowed a...)} = {\frac{}{12}}}

@vspace{1ex}

@math{p(bird | swallowed a) =} @math{\frac{c(swallowed a bird)}{c(swallowed a...)} = {\frac{}{12}}}

@vspace{1ex}

@math{p(cat | swallowed a) =} @math{\frac{c(swallowed a cat)}{c(swallowed a...)} = {\frac{}{12}}}

@vspace{1ex}

The lady most likely swallowed a @fitb{5em}{}. The second most likely option is that she swallowed a @fitb{5em}{}. There is an equal probability that she swallowed a @fitb{5em}{} or a @fitb{5em}{}.
