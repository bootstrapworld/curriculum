@n Choose Transform Attribute from the drop-down menu.

@n We want to create a Transformer that will replace all ages less than 5 with the Boolean `true`. In other words, it will _transform_ our "age" column into a column that tells us if an animal is young or not. What is a good name for this Transformer?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{transform-is-young}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Select the dataset you'd like to transform.


@n What attribute will we be transforming? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Age}}

@vspace{1ex}

@star Select the attribute, paying attention the sentence we've starred (left). What happened?

@fitb{}{}

@n What would be an appropriate name for our transformed attribute? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Young`}}

@n The contract includes a Domain (row) only. What is the Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Boolean`}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's write a purpose statement: _The expression consumes @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{a row}}, and produces @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{true}} if the age is less than 5._

@n What is the expression? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Age < 5`}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Apply the Transformer.

== More Transforming (On Your Own)

@n Now, try creating a Transformer called `weight-in-kg`. (Note: To convert pounds to kilograms, divide pounds by 2.205.) How many kilograms is the heaviest animal in the shelter? _Hint: If you want to see the animals listed in order by weight, select the attribute name and select "Sort Ascending."_

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Kujo, the heaviest animal, is 78 kilograms.}}

@n Create a Transformer called `round-pounds` that uses this expression: `round(Pounds)`. Look at the new table. Explain what the `round` function does.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Pounds were rounded to the nearest whole number.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Create a Transformer called `concatenate` that transforms Name using this expression: `concat(Name, Species).` What happened?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Concatenation is linking or chaining things together in a series. Name and Species were concatenated, here.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Describe how you could use a Transformer to change the number of weeks to adoption to instead show the number of days to adoption.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I would create a Transform Transformer that transforms Weeks to Days. I would use the expression `Weeks * 7`}}

@fitb{}{}
