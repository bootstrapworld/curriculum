= Variability of Animals' Weights

== Make Your Predictions

@link-instructions{
The folks at the shelter want to approximate the amount of food they need to purchase for the coming month. They know there is a relationship between an animal's weight and how much it eats, so they are discussing the distribution of animals' weights. Help them out by responding to the prompts below. For question 7, you'll need to use the @starter-file{expanded-animals-sub-pops}.
}

@n Imagine a _typical_ animal from each of these four species. Rank the animals from lightest (1) to heaviest (4). +
@hspace{2em} dog: @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{4}} @hspace{2em} rabbit: @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{2}}  @hspace{2em} cat: @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{3}} @hspace{2em} tarantula: @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n Circle the species you expect to have the _greatest_ variability in weight: @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{dog @hspace{5em}} rabbit @hspace{5em} cat @hspace{5em} tarantula

@n Circle the species you expect to have the _least_ variability in weight: @hspace{3em} dog @hspace{5em} rabbit @hspace{5em} cat @hspace{5em} @ifsoln-choice{tarantula}

@n The dot plots below display the weight distributions of cats, rabbits, and tarantulas. Identify the species of each plot.

@n Explain how you made your decisions. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Of the 3 species, cats weigh the most and their weights have the most variability, while tarantulas weigh the least and also have the least variability.}}

== Test Your Predictions Using Pyret

@n Using @starter-file{expanded-animals-sub-pops}, build a dot plot for each species. Fill in the cells below using information from your dot plots. Some cells have been filled in for you. You can hover your mouse over specific points on the dot plot for additional information on an individual animal.

| Range/variability | 3-172 lbs | @ifsoln{0.8-13.4 lbs} | @ifsoln{1.5-5 lbs} | @ifsoln{0.03 - 0.375 lbs}

| Typical weight | about 55 lbs | @ifsoln{about 8 lbs} | @ifsoln{about 3.5 lbs} | @ifsoln{about 0.2 lbs}

@n Purchasing pet food would be simpler if staff at the shelter can plan to feed each individual pet of a species the _exact same quantity of food_. Do you think this possible for any of the four species (without over- or underfeeding any of the animals)? Explain. If not, can you make any recommendations about quantity of food to purchase? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Feeding each dog the same amount of food is definitely not a good idea. It's probably not a good idea to feed the cats, rabbits, or tarantulas }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ the same amount of food, either. (Students may want to engage in some debate over the smaller three species.)}}
