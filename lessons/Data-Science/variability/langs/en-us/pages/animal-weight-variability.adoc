= Variability of Animals' Weights

== Make Your Predictions

@link-instructions{
The folks at the shelter want to approximate the amount of food they need to purchase for the coming month. They know there is a relationship between an animal's weight and how much it eats, so they are discussing the distribution of animals' weights. Help them out by responding to the prompts below. For question 7, you'll need to use the @starter-file{expanded-animals-sub-pops}.
}

@n Imagine a _typical_ animal from each of these four species, and estimate its weight. +
@hspace{2em}(To get you started, we've provided a weight estimate for a typical dog.) +
@hspace{2em} dog: @fitb{7em}{55 lbs} @hspace{2em} rabbit: @fitb{7em}{}  @hspace{2em} cat: @fitb{7em}{} @hspace{2em} tarantula: @fitb{7em}{}

@n Circle the species you expect to have the _greatest_ variability in weight: @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{dog @hspace{5em}} rabbit @hspace{5em} cat @hspace{5em} tarantula

@n Circle the species you expect to have the _least_ variability in weight: @hspace{3em} dog @hspace{5em} rabbit @hspace{5em} cat @hspace{5em} @ifsoln-choice{tarantula}

@n The dot plots below display the weight distributions of cats, rabbits, and tarantulas. Identify the species of each plot.

@n Explain how you made your decisions. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Of the 3 species, cats weigh the most and their weights have the most variability, while tarantulas weigh the least and also have the least variability.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Imagine what the dot plot showing the distribution of dogs' weights will look like. Describe the dot plot, discussing peaks, gaps, outliers, and variability. It is okay if your prediction is off! @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The dot plot would probably range from about 5 pounds to 150 pounds. There will be a peak near 55 pounds. Most dogs do not weigh 150 pounds,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{so the upper values will be outliers (separated from the rest of the data by a gap). Variability will be high because the spread is wide.}}

== Test Your Predictions Using Pyret

@n Using @starter-file{expanded-animals-sub-pops}, build a dot plot for each species @ifproglang{pyret}{using the provided code}. Fill in the blanks, below, using information from your dot plots. You can hover your mouse over specific points for additional information on an individual animal.


[cols="1,2,2,2,2"]

| `dot-plot(dog-table, “name”, “pounds”)`
| `dot-plot(cat-table, “name”, “pounds”)`
| `dot-plot(rabbit-table, “name”, “pounds”)`
| `dot-plot(tarantula-table, “name”, “pounds”)`

| Range | 3-172 lbs | @ifsoln{0.8-13.4 lbs} | @ifsoln{1.5-5 lbs} | @ifsoln{0.03 - 0.375 lbs}

| Gaps	| 123-161 lbs | @ifsoln{11-13.4 lbs}  | No significant gaps  | No significant gaps

| Outliers | Kojo (172 lbs)

Mr. PB (161 lbs) 	| @ifsoln{Hercules (13.4 lbs)} | No significant outliers | No significant outliers

| Typical weight | about 55 lbs | @ifsoln{about 8 lbs} | @ifsoln{about 3.5 lbs} | @ifsoln{about 0.2 lbs}

@n Purchasing pet food would be simpler if staff at the shelter can plan to feed each individual pet of a species the _exact same quantity of food_. Do you think this possible for any of the four species (without over- or underfeeding any of the animals)? Explain. If not, can you make any recommendations about quantity of food to purchase? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Feeding each dog the same amount of food is definitely not a good idea. It's probably not a good idea to feed the cats, rabbits, or tarantulas }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ the same amount of food, either. (Students may want to engage in some debate over the smaller three species.)}}
