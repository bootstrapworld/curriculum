= Variability of Dot Plots

@link-instructions{
The shelter is thinking about the distribution of different animals' weights so that they can approximate the amount of food they need to purchase. Help them out by responding to the prompts below. For question 7, you'll need to use the @starter-file{expanded-animals-sub-pops}.
}

@n Imagine a _typical_ animal from each of these four species, and estimate its weight. (To get you started, we've provided a weight estimate for a typical dog.) @hspace{2em} dog: @fitb{7em}{55 lbs} @hspace{2em} rabbit: @fitb{7em}{}  @hspace{2em} cat: @fitb{7em}{} @hspace{2em} tarantula: @fitb{7em}{}


@n Circle the species with the _greatest_ variability in weight: @hspace{2em} dog @hspace{5em} rabbit @hspace{5em} cat @hspace{5em} tarantula

@n Circle the species with the _least_ variability in weight: @hspace{3em} dog @hspace{5em} rabbit @hspace{5em} cat @hspace{5em} tarantula

@n Below are dot plots for rabbits, cats, and tarantulas--but they aren't labelled! Write the species that you think is displayed on each plot in the blank space provided.

@n Explain why your species labels (above) make sense. @fitb{}{}

@n Imagine what the dot plot showing the distribution of dogs' weights will look like. Describe the dot plot, discussing peaks, gaps, outliers, and variability. @fitb{}{}

@n Using @starter-file{expanded-animals-sub-pops}, build a dot plot for each species @ifproglang{pyret}{using the provided code}. Fill in the blanks, below, using information from your dot plots. You can hover your mouse over specific points for additional information on an individual animal.

@n Purchasing pet food is easier when the folks at the shelter can plan to feed each individual pet of a species the _exact same quantity of food_. For which of the four species do you think that this is possible (without over- or underfeeding any of the animals)? Explain. @fitb{}{}
