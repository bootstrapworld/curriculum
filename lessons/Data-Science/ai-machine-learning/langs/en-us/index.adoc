== What is Machine Learning @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn about __machine learning__, .


=== Launch

Over the past few years, you’ve probably heard some buzz about Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology that enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is behind ChatGPT, which appears able to develop video games, perform strongly on the SAT, or write a novel... and its capabilities are growing everyday.

Let’s be real... the “buzz” about AI could probably more accurately be described as a non-stop omnipresent deluge of information and misinformation. The conversation around AI is sometimes full of optimism and possibility, while at other times it is laced with fear and dread.

Before we start learning about AI (How does it actually work? What's the connection to data science?), let’s consider what sort of information we’ve absorbed about AI just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
@Q{How do those books, movies, TV shows, and video games characterize AI?}
@Q{In your experience, is AI usually portrayed in a positive or negative light?}
}

@teacher{
As students discuss different representations of AI, pay attention to see if any themes emerge. Create a list on the board as the conversation evolves. Some possible themes are: robot turns on its creator; AI rebellion; robots usurp control; AI-controlled society; and simulated reality!
}

As it turns out, characterizations of AI featuring robot rebellion and the like envision technology that *does not currently exist*.  That said, there is plenty of AI that we interact with each and every day—and the futuristic dystopian AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the AI of the present.

The AI that we interact with—in fact the only type of AI that we have achieved—is called Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI). ANI generally focuses on a single narrow task and has a limited range of abilities. Virtual assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa, to name a few) are one example. These apps respond to voice commands in order to perform simple tasks (setting alarms, making phone class, and answering questions). Can you think of any others?

@QandA{
@Q{What forms of AI appear in your life on a day-to-day basis?}
@A{Possible responses: TikTok’s algorithm, GPS, text prediction, chess playing computers, grammar correcting apps.}
@Q{What is the most impressive AI you have encountered in your daily life?}
@A{Allow students to share. }
}

=== Investigate

To consider one example, let’s discuss song and video recommendation by apps such as YouTube and Spotify.

@QandA{

@Q{Has Spotify or YouTube ever recommended you a new song or video that you enjoyed? Has it ever recommended you something that you _didn't_ enjoy? Elaborate.}
@A{Answers will vary. Allow students to share their personal experiences.}

@Q{How and why do you think recommendation algorithms seem to "know" what content you will like?}
@A{Allow students to share their responses. Some possible responses include: it reviews my viewing / listening history; it has access to the content I have skipped; it sees which videos and songs I return to over and over.}

@Q{Why do you think the songs and videos recommended are sometimes _not_ what you were hoping to discover?}
@A{Our tastes are not always entirely predictable. Just because a listener enjoys _some_ upbeat pop music with a female vocalist does not indicate that they will enjoy _all_ upbeat pop music with a female vocalist.}

}

Hopefully, our conversation about automatic song and video recommendation got you thinking about how computers need to be _trained_ on data for machine learning to happen.

In the case of song and video recommendation, Spotify and YouTube's algorithms process all the available data about your listening/viewing preferences. Let's say, however, that you have a history of listening to folk music... but a desire to branch out and explore some hip hop. Spotify cannot read your mind, nor will it guess that maybe today is the day you try some new music that is out of your comfort zone; it can only process the data you've provided it, and build a predictive model based on that data. While there's a small chance that Spotify will recommended hip hop music that is _influenced_ by folk music (especially if it features a female vocalist!). If you *really* want to branch out, ask a friend for a recommendation... and listen to it. If you spend enough time listening to hip hop, Spotify will eventually start generating hip hop recommendations.

@lesson-point{
Machine learning is driven by data. More data results in more accurate task completion.
}

The type of data that we use to train artificial intelligence varies by situation.
