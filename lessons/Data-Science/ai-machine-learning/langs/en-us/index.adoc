=== Overview
Students learn about __machine learning__, .

=== Launch

In the last few years, there has been a lot of buzz about Artificial Intelligence (AI) - technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. How much of what we've heard can we trust? Should we be fearful... or optimistic?

@QandA{
@Q{First, let's consider pop culture: What are some books, movies, video games, or TV shows you know of that feature artificial intelligence, or AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
@Q{How do those books, movies, video games, or TV shows characterize AI? Is AI usually portrayed in a positive or negative light?}
}

@teacher{
As students discuss different representations of AI, pay attention to see if any themes emerge. Create a list on the board as the conversation evolves. Some possible themes include: robot turns on its creator; AI rebellion; robots usurp control; AI-controlled society; and simulated reality!
}

As it turns, characterizations of AI featuring robot rebellion and the like draw on two types of AI that *do not currently exist*. In other words, these sorts of AI are entirely hypothetical! The only place you will encounter them is in sci fi, movies, and video games. *Artificial General Intelligence* (AGI) theoretically can think _on the same level as a human_, while *Artificial Super Intelligence* (ASI) __surpasses__ human intelligence and capabilities.

That said, there is plenty of AI that we interact with each and every day. As it turns out, the futuristic dystopian fiction we consume can interfere with the way that we understand what the AI of the present actually does.

The AI that we interact with is called Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI). ANI generally focuses on a single narrow task and has a limited range of abilities. Virtual assistants - Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa, to name a few - are one example. These apps respond to voice commands in order to perform simple tasks (setting alarms, making phone class, and answering questions).

@QandA{
@Q{What forms of AI appear in your life on a day-to-day basis?}
@A{Possible responses: FaceID, TikTokâ€™s algorithm, GPS, text prediction, chess playing computers, grammarly.}
