== What is Machine Learning @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn about __machine learning__, .


=== Launch

Over the past few years, you’ve probably heard some buzz about Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology that enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is behind ChatGPT, which can develop video games, perform strongly on the SAT, or write a novel... and its capabilities are growing everyday.

Let’s be real... the “buzz” about AI could probably more accurately be described as a non-stop omnipresent deluge of information and misinformation. The conversation around AI is sometimes full of optimism and possibility, while at other times it is laced with fear and dread.

Before we start learning about AI (How does it actually work? What's the connection to data science?), let’s consider what sort of information we’ve absorbed about AI just by consuming books, movies, TV, and video games.

@QandA{
@Q{What are some books, movies, TV shows, or video games you know of that feature AI?}
@A{Some possible responses include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, the Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator, Wall-E, Iron Man, Big Hero 6, The Mitchells versus the Machines, Blade Runner, I Robot}
@Q{How do those books, movies, TV shows, and video games characterize AI?}
@Q{In your experience, is AI usually portrayed in a positive or negative light?}
}

@teacher{
As students discuss different representations of AI, pay attention to see if any themes emerge. Create a list on the board as the conversation evolves. Some possible themes are: robot turns on its creator; AI rebellion; robots usurp control; AI-controlled society; and simulated reality!
}

As it turns out, characterizations of AI featuring robot rebellion and the like envision technology that *does not currently exist*.  That said, there is plenty of AI that we interact with each and every day–and the futuristic dystopian AI imagined in movies, video games, and books can sometimes interfere with the way that we understand the AI of the present.

The AI that we interact with - and the only type of AI that we have achieved - is called Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI). ANI generally focuses on a single narrow task and has a limited range of abilities. Virtual assistants - Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa, to name a few - are one example. These apps respond to voice commands in order to perform simple tasks (setting alarms, making phone class, and answering questions). Can you think of any others?

@QandA{
@Q{What forms of AI appear in your life on a day-to-day basis?}
@A{Possible responses: FaceID, TikTok’s algorithm, GPS, text prediction, chess playing computers, grammar correcting apps.}
@Q{What is the most impressive AI you have encountered in your daily life?}
@A{Allow students to share. }
}

=== Investigate

To consider one example, let’s discuss facial recognition technology (or FaceID).

@Q{How and why do you think face identification - like on your phone - can recognize your face?}
@A{Allow students to share their responses. If needed, prompt students to recall how they needed to "train" their FaceID when they got a new phone by looking into the camera at a variety of different angles.}
@Q{Do you ever opt to use a passcode or finger identification rather than face identification? If so, why?}
@A{Answers will vary. Sometimes face identification cannot recognize my face because of glasses or a mask; sometimes it is too dark; sometimes it is inconvenient.}
@Q{How often does FaceID fail to recognize your face?}
@A{Responses will vary depending on the phone and the student; glasses wearers may complain about FaceID failure more than others.}
}

Hopefully, our conversation about FaceID got you thinking about how computers need to be _trained_ on data for machine learning to happen.

In the case of FaceID, your phone's training involved processing images of your face at a variety of different angles. It did *not* train on images of your face in the dark, or wearing sun glasses, or a protective face mask.

@lesson-point{
Machine learning is driven by data. More data results in more accurate task completion.
}

The type of data that we use to train artificial intelligence varies by situation.
