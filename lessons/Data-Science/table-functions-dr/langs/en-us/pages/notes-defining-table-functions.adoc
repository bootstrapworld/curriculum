The steps of the Design Recipe don't change just because we're working with Rows, but we can make some adjustments when using Row-consuming functions to filter tables and build columns! 

@vspace{1ex}

Let's try a concrete example: _Write a function `is-lizard`, which tells us whether an animal is a lizard._

== Contract and Purpose

- We still want to pick good names. Since we're writing a function to check if an animal is a lizard, call it `is-lizard`!
- The Domain is a lot easier -- it's _always_ a `Row`!
- The Range is easier, too. If we're writing a function to filter a Table, we know the Range _has to be a Boolean_. (What would it be if we were building a column of Numbers? Images? Strings?)

== Examples

The goal of the Examples step is to _find the pattern_ that represents what the function does. When working with Rows, sometimes we have to start by just focusing on what the answer should be. +
Suppose we have two rows defined: 

[cols="2a,2a,1a", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
|`lizard-row` (which happens to be a lizard) |`cat-row` (which happens to be a cat) |
|===

We can imagine the answers for an `is-lizard` function to be...

```
examples:
	is-lizard(lizard-row) is true
	is-lizard(cat-row)    is false
end
```

But why do we think these expressions will evaluate to `true` and `false`? +
_We KNOW `lizard-row` is a lizard, and we KNOW `cat-row` is a cat and not a lizard..._ +
If we replace our answers with the Boolean expressions that compare their species, someone else would be able to follow our logic.

```
examples:
	is-lizard(lizard-row) is "lizard" == "lizard"  # will produce true
	is-lizard(cat-row)    is "cat"    == "lizard"  # will produce false
end
```

And what work would the computer need to do to know that `lizard-row` is a lizard and `cat-row` is a cat? Look in the `species` column! 

```
examples:
	is-lizard(lizard-row) is lizard-row["species"] == "lizard" # will produce true
	is-lizard(cat-row)    is cat-row["species"]    == "lizard" # will produce false
end
```
Sometimes we can get straight to this final form in one step, but sometimes it helps to break our thinking down into pieces. +
Once we see the pattern, we can _circle and label what changes_. +
In this case, only the Row representing the animal changes! So we might use `r` as our label, to represent the Row.

== Definition
The final step in the Design Recipe is to take the pattern from our examples and _generalize it_ to work with any input. +
It's no different when working with Rows. 
@vspace{1ex}

Our previous step is a huge help. We can *copy everything that stays the same*, and replace the part that changes with the label we used. +
Combining the Contract, Purpose, Examples and Definitions, we end up with:

```
# is-lizard :: Row -> Boolean
# Consumes a Row, and checks to see if the species column is "lizard"
examples:
	is-lizard(lizard-row) is lizard-row["species"] == "lizard" # will produce true
	is-lizard(cat-row)    is cat-row["species"]    == "lizard" # will produce false
end
fun is-lizard(r): r["species"] == "lizard" end
```
