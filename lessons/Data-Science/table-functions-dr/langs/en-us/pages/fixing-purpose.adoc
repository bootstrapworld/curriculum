= Fixing Purpose Statements

Beneath each of the data science problems below is a purpose statement (generated by ChatGPT!) that is either missing information or includes unnecessary information.

- Write an improved version of each purpose statement beneath the original.
- Then, explain what was wrong with the ChatGPT-generated Purpose Statement.

@n *Data Science Problem:* _Alice is looking to adopt a pet, but only wants to look at animals who are fixed. Write a function `is-fixed`, which takes in a Row and returns true if the animal is fixed. Otherwise, return false._

@vspace{1ex}

*The AI's Purpose Statement:* Take in a Row and check if the "is-fixed" column is true.

*Improved Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Consumes a Row and check if the `fixed` column is `true`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

*Problem with the AI's Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The column is called `fixed`, not `is-fixed`}}

@n *Data Science Problem:* _The animal shelter wants to make nametags for all the animals, drawing their names in large purple letters_

@vspace{1ex}

*The AI's Purpose Statement:* Given an animal, use the "name" column to draw the text in size 100 font.

*Improved Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Consume a Row and use the text function with the animal's name, size 100, and "purple" for the color. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

*Problem with the AI's Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It does not specify the color.}}

@n *Data Science Problem:* _The animal shelter decides that some dogs need to go on a diet, and get them different food to help them lose weight. Write a function `is-heavy`, which takes in a Row and checks to see if it's a dog weighing more than 100 pounds._

@vspace{1ex}

*The AI's Purpose Statement:* Take in the species and the number of pounds, and check if the species is dog and it weighs a lot.

*Improved Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Consume a Row, and check if `species == "dog"` AND `pounds > 100`.}}

@fitb{}{}

*Problem with the AI's Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's taking in the two columns separately, instead of a row that contains them...}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and it did not specify the number of pounds.}}

@n *Data Science Problem:* Sammi wants to adopt a kitten less than a year old.

@vspace{1ex}

*The AI's Purpose Statement:* Take in a row, and check if the age is less than 1.

*Improved Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Consume a row and check if `species == "cat"` AND `age < 1` }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

*Problem with the AI's Purpose Statement:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{forgot to check the species!}}
