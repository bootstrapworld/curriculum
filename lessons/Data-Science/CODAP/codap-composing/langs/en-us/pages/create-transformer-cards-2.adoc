= Create Transformer Cards

The table `t` below represents four animals from the shelter:

[.data, cols='5', options="header"]
|===
| name        | sex       | age   | fixed   | pounds
| `"Toggle"`  | `"female"`| `3`   | `true`  | `48`
| `"Fritz"`   | `"male"`  | `4`   | `true`  | `92`
| `"Nori"`    | `"female"`| `6`   | `true`  | `35.3`
|===

Provide the information needed to define each Transformer. Remember:

- Filter requires three inputs

- Build requires four inputs

- Transform requires five inputs
