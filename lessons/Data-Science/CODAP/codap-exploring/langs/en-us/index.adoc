| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Identify examples of the following data types: Numbers, Strings, and Booleans
* Practice writing Numbers, Strings, and Booleans
* Write expressions and functions that produce values of those types

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's learn how to tell whether a value is a Number, String or a Boolean.

* Error messages are the computer trying to give us a clue that something is wrong.  Model reacting to @vocab{error messages} with interest to demonstrate to students that the messages are a helpful tool.

== Strings and Numbers @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students experiment with the CODAP software platform. They explore String and Number data types, and investigate how these data types behave in CODAP.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/driver-navigator.png, 150}}
When programming in this class, you'll be working together using the _Driver/Navigator_ model. Each group can only have one "Driver" - their hands are on the keyboard, and their job is to manage the typing, clicking, shortcuts, etc. If you're not a Driver, you're a "Navigator" - your job is to tell the Driver where to go, what to type, etc. A good Driver types only what the Navigator tells them to, and a good Navigator makes sure to give clear and precise instructions.

@span{.title}{The Driver/Navigator Model}

This model of pair programming is extremely useful for teasing apart the "thinking" step from the "typing" one. Students - especially those who are new to text-based programming or typing itself - can struggle to put their thoughts into the programming environment. This model allows them to focus on _communicating their ideas_, but letting the Driver focus on the coding. Likewise, the Driver has a chance to focus on syntax and programming. Finally, the requirement that ideas are translated through another person's hands is an excellent scaffold for getting students talking about their thinking and about code.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Open the @starter-file{animals} in CODAP.
- Explore this data - and CODAP! - by following the instructions and recording your observations on @printable-exercise{codap-exploration.adoc}.
- What did you Notice? What do you Wonder?
--

Debrief with students. Discuss any difficulties that students encountered, for instance: the grey plus sign does not appear unless a table or table row is selected; the button that minimizes doesn't appear unless the table's title is selected; and, the same button that minimizes also expands.


=== Investigate

The folks at the shelter need help completing a variety of tasks using CODAP! To do this, they need to learn how CODAP handles the kinds of data in the animals data set (numbers, words, and more...).

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Complete @printable-exercise{strings.adoc} and @printable-exercise{numbers.adoc}.
- What did you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _The Synthesize section (below) outlines several of CODAP's features that students likely observed._
- Did you get any error messages? What did you learn from them?
** _Most of the error messages we've just seen were drawing our attention to @vocab{syntax errors}: missing commas, unclosed strings, etc._
--

Through the aactivities above, students should discover two basic data types:
- @vocab{Number} - a data type representing real numbers
- @vocab{String} - a data type for any sequence of characters between quotation marks

=== Synthesize

Discuss what students have learned:

- Numbers and Strings evaluate to themselves.
- CODAP converts fractions into decimals automatically.
- Anything in quotes is a String, with one exception: CODAP will convert strings containing only Numbers (e.g. “42” but not “42 hello”) into Number values.
- Strings _must_ have quotation marks on both sides.
- Operators work just like they do in math - with a few exceptions. The `+`, for instance, will join together two strings, or a Number and a String.
- CODAP follows the standard order of operations.

Here are some questions to encourage reflection on functions and error messages:

- Think about the new columns you created. How did the inputs relate to the outputs?
- Did you encounter any new functions that intrigued you?
- What kind of error messages did you encounter, if any?

Error messages are a way for CODAP to explain what went wrong, and are a helpful way of finding mistakes. Emphasize how useful they can be, and why students should read those messages out loud before asking for help.

== Booleans @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
This lesson introduces students to Booleans, a unique data type with only two values: "true" and "false", and why they are useful in both the real world and the programming environment.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
What's the answer: is 3 greater than 10?

Boolean-producing expressions are yes-or-no questions and will always evaluate to either `true` (“yes”) or `false` (“no”).  The ability to separate inputs into two categories is unique and quite useful!

For example:

- Some roller coasters with loops require passengers to be a minimum height to make sure that riders are safely held in place by the one-size-fits all harnesses. The gate keeper doesn't care exactly how tall you are, they just check whether you are as tall as the mark on the pole. If you are tall enough, you can ride, but they don't let people on the ride who are shorter than the mark because they can't keep them safe.
- When you log into your email, the computer asks for your password and checks whether it matches what's on file. If the match is `true` it takes you to your messages, but, if what you enter doesn't match, you get an error message instead.

[.lesson-instruction]
Brainstorm other scenarios where Booleans are useful in and out of the programming environment.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/booleans.adoc}.
- Write down your predictions before testing them in CODAP. When you're ready, test the Boolean expression in @starter-file{boolean}. Again, you will work from left to right, clicking on the column name, and then choosing "Edit Formula" from the drop-down menu that appears. You will type each Boolean into the "Edit Formula" box.
