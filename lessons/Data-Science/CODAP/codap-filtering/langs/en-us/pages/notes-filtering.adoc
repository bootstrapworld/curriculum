= Filter and Booleans

A *Boolean* is a type of data with two values: true and false.

*Transformers* allow us to transform datasets to produce new, distinct output datasets, instead of modifying the original input dataset itself. We use them to manipulate tables and enable low-stakes "what if?" exploration.

We must provide the `Filter` Transformer with a Boolean expression, which evaluates to true or false. `Filter` then produces a copy of the input dataset that only has the cases for which the expression evaluated to true.

Every Transformer we make requires a unique expression. It's important to get the expression just right, or the Transformer will produce an error. Strings belong inside quotation marks, but Booleans do not!
