@n What do you Notice about the `Filter` Transformer on the left, which you can also view in the @starter-file{boolean}?

@n In the @starter-file{boolean}, open `filter-is-heavy`. (To do so, select the `-` that appears on the left when you hover.) Select "Apply Transformer". In your own words, describe what happened when you applied the Filter transformer to the Animals Dataset. @fitb{}{}

== Some Booleans You Might Know

In the `filter-is-heavy` Transformer (above), we used a _Boolean_ expression to tell CODAP that we wanted to keep all rows where Pounds was greater than 32. The _greater than_ symbol (@math{>}) is an example of a Boolean operator that you're probably already familiar with.

@n Here are six different Booleans that we will use in CODAP.

- Put a check mark by the Booleans where you can guess what they do.
- Put a question mark by any Booleans that you're not sure about.

*Boolean-producing expressions are yes-or-no questions and will always evaluate to either `true` (“yes”) or `false` (“no”).* What will each of the expressions below evaluate to? Write down your prediction in the space provided. You'll get a chance to see if you were correct on the next page.
