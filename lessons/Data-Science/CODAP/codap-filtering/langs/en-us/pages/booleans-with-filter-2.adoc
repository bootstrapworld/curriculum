== Booleans and Numbers

In the @starter-file{boolean}, open the Transformer called `filter-is-???`, pictured below. For each prompt below, you will select "Edit" in the Transformer, and then enter the specified Boolean expression. (Relevant boxes are highlighted in red in the image on the right.)

@n Click Edit. Change `Pounds=` so that it says `Pounds=32`. What happened? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A dataset with only animals weighing 32 pounds was created.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n What would be a good *name* for a Transformer with the expression `Pounds=32`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{filter-is-32lbs}}

@vspace{1ex}


@n What would be a good Purpose Statement for a Transformer with the expression `Pounds=32`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Checks the row to see if Pounds is 32}}

|===

@n With your partner, test out each of the Booleans listed below, using *`Pounds` @fitb{1em}{} `32`* as the Transformer's expression.

- What happens if you put @math{<} in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a new dataset with animals weighing less than 32 pounds.}}

- What happens if you put @math{>} in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a new dataset with animals weighing more than 32 pounds.}}

- What happens if you put @math{<=} in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a new dataset with animals weighing 32 pounds or less.}}

- What happens if you put @math{>=} in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a new dataset with animals weighing 32 pounds or more.}}

- What happens if you put @math{!=} in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a new dataset with animals weighing that do *not* weigh 32 pounds.}}

== Booleans and Strings

@n Click Edit. This time, type `Name>"Maple"` in the expression box. What happened? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Predict what will happen if you edit the expression so that it says `Name<="Maple"` (then try it!).@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a dataset with}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Maple and all animals that are *before* Maple, alphabetically.}}

@n With your partner, test out each of the Booleans listed below, using `Name` @fitb{1em}{} `Maple` as the expression.

- What happens if you put @math{<} in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a dataset with animals that are *before* Maple, alphabetically.}}


- What happens if you put `=` in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a dataset with just Maple.}}

- What happens if you put `>=` in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a dataset with Maple and all animals that are *after* Maple, alphabetically.}}

- What happens if you put `<=` in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a dataset with Maple and all animals that are *before* Maple, alphabetically.}}

- What happens if you put `!=` in the blank? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a dataset with Maple and all animals *except* Maple.}}

@n Edit the Transformer's expression so that it says: `beginsWith(Name, "Sn")`. What happened?@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We get a dataset with all animals with names that start with Sn.}}


@n Now try this expression: `beginsWith(Name, "sn")`. Did you get the result you expected? @fitb{}{}

@star Go back to @printable-exercise{booleans-with-filter.adoc} and use a different color pen to correct any questions (4-15) that you got wrong.
