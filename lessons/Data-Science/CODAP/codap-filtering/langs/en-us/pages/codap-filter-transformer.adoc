@n Choose Filter from the drop-down menu that appears (Box 1).

@vspace{1ex}

@n Name the Transformer `filter-is-dog`. Type the name into Box 2 (left).

@vspace{1ex}

@n Click on "Dataset to Filter" to confirm that the Animals Dataset is selected.

@n The Contract's Domain is Row. Why does that makes sense?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When we filter, we look at each row, one by one.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n The Range - is Boolean. Why does that make sense?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are going to determine if the expression is true or false for each row.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n What Purpose Statement will you type into Box 6?

@ifsoln{Checks the row to see if the species is dog}

|===


@n Enter `Species = "dog"` as the expression (Box 7). Select `Apply Transformer`. What happens? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A copy of the original dataset is created, with only dogs!}}

@n Try typing `species = "dog"` as the expression (instead of `Species = "dog"`). What happens? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_An error message appears that says, "Evaluating `species = "dog"` failed: 'species' is unrecognized."_}}

@n What are some other possible reasons you might get an error message for the expression? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Incorrect spelling, wrong capitalization, forgetting quotation marks._}}

@n Select "Save Transformer." Describe what happens. Why might it be useful to save a Transformer? @fitb{}{}

== More Filtering (On Your Own)

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-old` that creates a new dataset with animals older than 5 years.

  * How many rows does the resulting table have?@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are 9 rows. Note: The Purpose Satement should say, "Checks the row to see if age is greater than 5."}}

  * How many datasets appeared in the drop-down menu for you to choose from? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There were two datasets.}}

  * Which dataset did you choose and why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{I chose the original dataset because it includes all animals.}}

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-fixed` that creates a new dataset with only fixed animals.

  * How many fixed animals are there at the shelter? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_There are 18._}}
