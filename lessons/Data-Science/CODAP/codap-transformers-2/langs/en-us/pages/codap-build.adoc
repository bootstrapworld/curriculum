== Create, Apply, and Save a Build Attribute Transformer (Step by Step)

@n Choose Build Attribute from the drop-down menu (Box 1).

@vspace{1ex}

@n At the shelter, animals are considered heavy when they weigh more than 40 pounds. Enter `build-is-heavy` as the Transformer Name (Box 2). What does this name tell you about the Transformer we are creating?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It will build a column that states `true` for heavy animals and `false` for lightweight animals.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Select the dataset you'd like to transform (Box 3).

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's name our new attribute `Heavy` (Box 4). What happened to the starred text (left) when you named the attribute?

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Ensure that the collection you are adding to is "cases" (Box 5).

@vspace{1ex}

@n A domain is provided (row), but not a range. What is the desired output for `build-is-heavy`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Write a purpose statement (Box 7). What do we want the expression to do?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Checks each row to see if Weight is greater than a specified amount.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Enter `Pounds > 40` as the expression (Box 8).

@vspace{1ex}

@n Apply the Transformer. To define the Transformer for future use, select `Save`.

== More Building (On Your Own)

@n Now, create a Transformer called `build-updated-age`. This Transformer will give the animals' ages one year from today. How many animals are 9 years-old one year from today?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Three animals.}}

@n Create and apply a Transformer that builds a column with the number of letters in each animal's name. What will you name your Transformer and the new attribute?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible answer: build-nameLength and nameLength}}

@n How many animals have exactly eight letters in their names? (If you're feeling adventurous, try using the `Count` Transformer here!)

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are five animals with eight letters in their name.}}

@n Now, use a Transformer and build a column that returns `true` if the number of letters in an animal's name (the column you created in Q11!) is less than or equal to five. *_Important note!_ If your attribute name (from Q11) has a space or a hyphen, CODAP will produce an error when you apply your Transformer. The fix is to put your entire attribute name inside tick marks when you type in your expression. (The tick mark key is in the upper left-hand corner of your keyboard.)* What expression will you use?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response: `nameLength <= 5`}}

@n Which dataset will you need to apply this Transformer to? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I'll need to use the dataset that I created in Q11 - otherwise my column with number of letters won't be included!}}
