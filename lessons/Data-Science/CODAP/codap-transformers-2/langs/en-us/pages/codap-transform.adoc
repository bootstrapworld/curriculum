@n Choose Transform Attribute from the drop-down menu.

@n We want to create a Transformer that will replace all ages less than 5 with the Boolean `true`. In other words, it will _transform_ our "age" column into a column that tells us if an animal is young or not. What is a good name for this Transformer?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{transform-is-young}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Select the dataset you'd like to transform.


@n What attribute will we be transforming? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Age}}

@vspace{1ex}

@star Select the attribute. Notice that CODAP replaced the blank in the starred line of text (left) with the attribute name you selected!

@n What would be an appropriate name for our transformed attribute? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Young`}}

@n The contract includes a Domain (row) only. What is the Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Boolean`}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's write a purpose statement: _Checks each_ @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{row}} _to see if_ @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{age is less than 5.}}

@n What is the expression? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Age < 5`}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Apply the Transformer.

@n Save the Transformer.

== More Transforming (On Your Own)

@n Now, try creating a Transformer called `transform-pounds`. (Note: To convert pounds to kilograms, divide pounds by 2.205.) How many kilograms is the heaviest animal in the shelter? _Hint: If you want to see the animals listed in order by weight, select the attribute name and select "Sort Ascending."_

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Kujo, the heaviest animal, is 78 kilograms.}}

@n Create a Transformer called `transform-pounds` that uses this expression: `round(Pounds)`. Look at the new table. Explain what the `round` function does.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Pounds were rounded to the nearest whole number.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Create a Transformer called `transform-Name+Species` that transforms Name using this expression: `concat(Name, Species).` Let's call the Transformed Attribute `Name+Species`. Write a Purpose Statement that describes what this expression does to each row.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Computes `Name+Species` by linking together `Name` and `Species` together in a series.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Create a Transformer to change the number of weeks to adoption to instead show the number of days to adoption. Provide the expression you used, along with the purpose statement describing what the expression does.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The expression is `Weeks * 7`. The purpose statement is: "Computes the product of `Weeks` and 7.~"}}
