@n Choose Transform Attribute from the drop-down menu.

@n We want to create a Transformer that will replace all ages less than 5 with the Boolean `true`. In other words, it will _transform_ our "age" column into a column that tells us if an animal is young or not. What is a good name for this Transformer?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{transform-is-young}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Select the dataset you'd like to transform.


@n What attribute will we be transforming? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Age}}

@vspace{1ex}

@star Select the attribute. Notice that CODAP replaced the blank in the starred line of text (left) with the attribute name you selected!

@n What would be an appropriate name for our transformed attribute? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Young`}}

@n The contract includes a Domain (row) only. What is the Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Boolean`}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's write a purpose statement: _Checks each_ @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{row}} _to see if_ @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{age is less than 5.}}

@n What is the expression? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Age < 5`}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Apply the Transformer.

@n Save the Transformer.

== More Transforming (On Your Own)

*Create a Transformer called `transform-pounds`. (Note: To convert pounds to kilograms, divide pounds by 2.205.)*

@n How many kilograms is the heaviest animal? _Hint: To see the animals in order by weight, select the attribute name then "Sort Ascending."_ @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Kujo is 78 kilograms.}}

@vspace{1ex}


*Create a Transformer called `transform-pounds` that uses this expression: `round(Pounds)`.*

@n What do you think the `round` function does? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Pounds were rounded to the nearest whole number.}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*Create a Transformer called `transform-Name+Species` that transforms Name using this expression: `concat(Name, Species).` Let's call the Transformed Attribute `Name+Species`.*

@n Write a Purpose Statement that describes what this expression does to each row.@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Computes `Name+Species` by linking `Name` and `Species` together.}}

@vspace{1ex}

*Create a Transformer to change the number of weeks to adoption to instead show the number of days to adoption.*

@n Provide the expression you used, along with the purpose statement describing what the expression does. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The expression is `Weeks * 7`. The purpose statement is: "Computes the product of `Weeks` and 7.~"}}
