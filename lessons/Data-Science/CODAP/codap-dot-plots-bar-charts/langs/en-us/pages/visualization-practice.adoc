Use the @starter-file{animals} to create the following visualizations in CODAP. First, fill in the blanks and check all boxes that apply. Next, predict and sketch what the display will look like. Then, create the visualization in CODAP. We've started the first one for you!

@vspace{1ex}

@n A histogram of the number of `pounds` that animals weigh.
