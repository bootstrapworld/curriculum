== Part A

@n How many tarantulas are male? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{9}} @hspace{4em} How many female? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{11}}

@indented{_Hint: Sort the table by `species`!_}

@n Would you imagine that the distribution of male and female animals will be similar for every species at the shelter? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{no idea!}}

== Part B

Sometimes we want to compare _sub-groups across groups_. In this example, we want to compare the distribution of sexes across each species. Fortunately, CODAP allows us to build a variety of visualizations where we specify both a group and a subgroup.

| To create a *stacked bar chart*...
| To make a *multi bar chart*...
|
- create a graph of randomly distributed points
- drag the _group_ to an axis
- drag the _sub-group_ to the center of the display
- from the Configuration menu, select "Fuse Dots into Bars"
- from the Configuration menu, select "Percent" as the scale.

- create a graph of randomly distributed points
- drag the _sub-group_ to an axis
- drag the _group_ to the `+` in the upper left-hand corner of the graph
- from the Configuration menu, select "Fuse Dots into Bars"
- to the right of the graph, locate and click the "Rescale Display" button (it looks like four arrows pointing in different directions) until you can see all of the data.

@n Make a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of sexes across species in our shelter.

@n Make a multi bar chart showing the distribution of sexes across species in our shelter.

@n What do you notice? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students may notice: The snails and clownfish are all hermaphrodites.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{For the other species there are about as many males as females.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you wonder? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students may wonder: Is there a reason there are more male dogs? And more female cats? }}

@n Which display would be most efficient for answering the question: "What percentage of cats are female?" Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{stacked bar chart}}

@n Which display would be most efficient for answering the question: "Are there more cats or dogs?" Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{multi bar chart}}

@n Write a question of your own that involves comparing subgroups across groups. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

Which display would be most efficient for answering your question? @fitb{20em}{} Make the display.

@n Write a different question that would be more efficient to answer with the other kind of display. @fitb{}{}
