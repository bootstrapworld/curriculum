The refugee charts below are drawn from the Refugee Starter File:
https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1rettr-BwPIJ5sSLRJFM8S8J4nyiHCtaZ&v=78aeaeb

The code used to filter the tables and generate them is:
t = refugees-table.filter(lam(r): string-contains(r["region"], "America") end)
stacked-bar-chart(t, "region", "democracy")
multi-bar-chart(t, "region", "democracy")

The animals charts are drawn from the expanded animals starter file:
https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1VflQhYwr_R3FIarKx1fvaAA50IDTXVp0&v=4d870d2

The code used to filter the tables and generate them is:
t = more-animals.filter(lam(r): string-contains(r["species"], "r" )end)
stacked-bar-chart(t, "species", "sex")
multi-bar-chart(t,  "species", "sex")

@n Is it possible that the same data was used for the multi bar charts as for the stacked bar charts? How do you know?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{yes. The proportions are consistent.}}

@n Write a question that it would be easiest to answer by looking at one of the multi bar charts.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample response: How many more rabbits are male than female?}}

@n Write a question that it would be easiest to answer by looking at one of the stacked bar charts.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample response: Which region had the highest proportion of full democracies?}}
