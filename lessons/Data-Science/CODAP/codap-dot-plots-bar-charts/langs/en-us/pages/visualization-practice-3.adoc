Use the @starter-file{animals} to create the following visualizations in CODAP. First, fill in the blanks and check all boxes that apply. Then, predict and draw what you think the visualization will look like. Finally, create the visualization in CODAP.

@n A box plot, using `Pounds` as the x-axis, for all the animals from the shelter. _Note: The `Measure` menu has lots of options! On this page, we've included the two options that *create new visualizations*._

@n (Challenge) A least squares line (also sometimes called a regression line), using the animals `species` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.
