Use the @starter-file{animals} to create the following visualizations in CODAP. First, fill in the blanks and check all boxes that apply. Next, predict and sketch what the display will look like. Then, create the visualization in CODAP.

@n A bar chart showing the `species` of animals from the shelter.

@n A scatter-plot, using the animals `name` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `pounds` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter. _Note: The `Measure` menu has lots of options! On this page, we've included the two options that *create new visualizations*._
