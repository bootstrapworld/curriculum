| Optional Project
| 
- @lesson-link{project-infographic}: Infographics are a powerful tool for communicating information, especially when made by people who actually understand how to connect visuals to data in meaningful ways. This project is an opportunity for students to become more flexible math thinkers while tapping into their creativity. It can be done on the computer or with pencil and paper.

== Displaying Categorical Variables

=== Overview

Students use the options on CODAP's _Configuration_ and _Measure_ menus to produce visualizations of the Animals Dataset.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

@QandA{
@Q{Where have you seen infographics and graphs used to visualize data in the real world?}
@A{Possible responses: election results, in textbooks, survey results, opinion polls, video games, etc.}
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

Today's lesson is all about producing visualizations in CODAP.

We'll walk through some of the basic mechanics of creating a visualization - and then you will have the opportunity to independently create and explore visualizations in CODAP.

@slidebreak{LaunchR}

@QandA{
Open the @starter-file{animals} in CODAP.

@image{images/codap-upper-left-toolbar.png, 300}


@Q{Click the `graph` icon from the horizontal toolbar in the upper left. (See screenshot above.) What appears?}
@A{A visualization called `cases` with many orange dots. The axes are not labeled. Screenshot below.}
}

@slidebreak{LaunchR}

@QandA{

@image{images/codap-initial-display.png,200}

@Q{Select a dot with your mouse. What happens?}
@A{The dot turns blue, and the corresponding row in the table is highlighted.}
@Q{What happens when you select a table row? How about multiple table rows?}
@A{The corresponding dot(s) turn blue.}
@Q{What happens when you click the "eye" icon (to the right of the graph or the table, depending on which is selected)?}
@A{A menu appears.}
}

@teacher{
Note: If students report that a blank graph appears (rather than a scatter plot), make sure CODAP is whitelisted on the browser's ad-blocker. Don't worry - CODAP never advertises to users!
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

Until we assign variables for the axes, the data points are randomly distributed on the graph. 

Hovering over an orange dot reveals the `name` of that particular animal. Selecting a particular dot causes the table row for that animal to be highlighted in blue. On Windows and Macs, holding the shift button allows us to select multiple dots in the data visualization. We can also select multiple rows by clicking on them (holding the shift key down on Windows, the Command key down on Macs).

@slidebreak{Launch}

When we select a table row (or multiple table rows), the corresponding dots change color. When we set aside selected and / or unselected cases (by using the "eye" icon), we can temporarily alter the amount of pets in the dataset (with the option to restore to the original dataset).

We can also resize the window by dragging its borders.


=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

Once we have a graph of randomly distributed data points, we can organize the data by selecting attributes from our _table_ that we want to appear on the axes of our graph.

@lesson-instruction{
- Practice manipulating the data by completing @printable-exercise{codap-visualizations-intro.adoc}.
- @opt{To dig deeper into bar charts, have students turn to @opt-printable-exercise{bar-chart-notice.adoc}.}
}

@vocab{Categorical} data is used to classify, rather than to measure. Only when data is being treated categorically will you be invited to fuse data points - transforming a dot plot into a bar chart. @vocab{Quantitative} (or numeric) data must measure or compare; it is subject to the laws of arithmetic.

=== Common Misconceptions

Bar charts look a lot like another kind of visualization - called a "histogram" - which visualizes _numeric_ data, not categorical.

Creating each of these visualizations begins the same way: we create a dot plot, and then modify it using CODAP's menus. Depending on what type of data the dot plot shows, we can transform it into either a bar chart (for categorical data), or a histogram (for numeric data). These visualizations serve unique purposes!

Pie charts visualize categorical data, too, but CODAP doesn't offer them largely because many find them @link{https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/pie.html, "challenging to read."}

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

@QandA{
@Q{How are bar charts similar to dot plots? How are they different?}
@Q{When would you want to use one chart instead of another?}
@Q{Which visualization do you find easier to interpret? Why?}
}



== Groups and Subgroups

=== Overview
Students learn how to create _groups within groups_, showing the relative frequency of one variable across values of another variable using stacked and multi bar charts.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch-DN}

@lesson-instruction{Turn to @printable-exercise{intro-stacked-multi.adoc} and complete Part A now using @starter-file{expanded-animals}.
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

Comparing groups is great, but sometimes we want to compare _sub-groups across groups_. In this example, we want to compare the distribution of sexes across each species.

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's step away from the Animals Dataset for a moment to learn about some new kinds of visualizations that would make it easier to answer questions like these by revealing the subgroups in a column. Turn to @printable-exercise{stacked-and-multi-notice.adoc}.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
}

@teacher{
You and your students may notice that the images of the stacked and multi bar charts on @printable-exercise{stacked-and-multi-notice.adoc} look different from the ones created in CODAP. We've used these alternative visualizations because we feel they are easier for students to interpret, leading to more fruitful discussion of the data.
}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

CODAP allows us to build a variety of visualizations where we specify both a group and a subgroup.

To create a *stacked bar chart*...

|

To make a *multi bar chart*...

|

- create a graph of randomly distributed points

- drag the _group_ to an axis

- drag the _sub-group_ to the center of the visualization

- from the Configuration menu, select "Fuse Dots into Bars"

- from the Configuration menu, select "Percent" as the scale.



|
- create a graph of randomly distributed points

- drag the _sub-group_ to an axis

- drag the _group_ to the `+` in the upper left-hand corner of the graph

- from the Configuration menu, select "Fuse Dots into Bars"

- to the right of the graph, locate and click the "Rescale Display" button (it looks like four arrows pointing in different directions) until you can see all of the data.

| Stacked Bar Charts put the _groups_ side by side, so it's easy to answer which species is the "most female". But it's more difficult to see whether there are more female dogs than male cats, because the bars don't all start from the bottom.
| Multi Bar Charts put the _subgroups_ side by side, so it's easy to answer whether there are more female dogs than male cats in the shelter. But it's a little more difficult to see which species is the "most female", because we have to estimate the relative lengths of each bar.

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}
All of the charts we've looked at in this lesson work with @vocab{categorical data}, showing us the frequency of values in one or two groups.

- What are some of the questions you asked about the animals dataset using these visualizations? And what did you learn?
- What kinds of questions need stacked or multi bar charts, rather than pie or bar charts
- What kinds of questions are better answered by stacked bar charts?
- What kinds of questions are better answered by multi bar charts?

== Exploring Other Visualizations

=== Overview
Students explore the CODAP data visualization options available to them. In doing so, they experiment with new charts and get comfortable with CODAP as a platform for doing data science.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch-DN}
There are _lots_ of different kinds of charts and plots that we can build in CODAP!


@lesson-instruction{
- Spend three minutes to see how many different visualizations you can produce using @starter-file{animals}.
- Be playful - click buttons and select from menu options to see what you can produce!
- Tip: Some menu icons only appear under specific conditions! For instance, clicking on the `cases` display brings up a menu of options.
}

@teacher{If students need a bit of encouraging, you might prod them to make scatter plots and histograms.

When time is up, invite students to share.
}


@QandA{
@Q{What did you discover?}
@Q{When did the `configuration` menu appear (the one that looks like a stacked bar chart)?}
@A{When there is another possible configuration of the data. For instance, when dots can be fused into bars, we see this menu.}
@Q{When did the `measure` menu appear (the one that looks like a ruler)?}
@A{This menu appears when there is an opportunity to change what is shown *along with* the points - for instance, connecting lines or calculating the frequency. Histograms and box plots appear alongside an existing visualization, so they appear on the `measure` menu.}
}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

CODAP is designed to be student-friendly! Its interface encourages guesswork... but we can save some time by being a bit more strategic.

Let's try a more methodical approach to creating visualizations.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
We're going to complete @printable-exercise{visualization-practice.adoc} together. To make a dot plot showing the sex of animals from the shelter, I'll ask myself three important questions:

@Q{Which *Column / Attributes* on which axes?}
@A{Sex belongs on the either axis.}
@Q{What *Type of Data*?}
@A{Male, female, and hermaphrodite are all categories. The chart will display categorical data.}
@Q{What *Configuration*?}
@A{CODAP initially creates a dot plot of the data, so no special configuration is needed.}
}

@teacher{
Focus on supporting students in learning how to pose productive questions when looking at data. Invite students to repeat the process you just modeled as they create a bar chart (Q2 on the same page) that shows the species of animals from the shelter.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
- With your partner, complete @printable-exercise{visualization-practice-2.adoc} and @printable-exercise{visualization-practice-3.adoc}.
- Summarize what you've observed about what visualization goes with what kind of data on the @printable-exercise{data-visualizations-organizer.adoc}. It may help to refer back to the "Practice Plotting" worksheets that you just completed. The "Notes" column can be filled in today, or you can add to it in future classes to use a reference.
}

@teacher{Students will want to take thorough notes on @printable-exercise{data-visualizations-organizer.adoc}, as they can use it as a resource and reference in future lessons.}

=== Common Misconceptions
There are _many_ possible misconceptions about data visualizations that students may encounter here. *But that's OK!* Understanding all those other plots is _not_ a learning goal for this lesson. Rather, the goal at this stage is to have them build familiarity and confidence with the CODAP tool and how it makes data visualizations.

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}
@QandA{
@Q{What visualizations did you find that work with just one column of data?}
@A{dot plots, bar charts, histograms and box plots}
@Q{What visualizations did you find that work with more than one column of data?}
@A{scatter plots and lr-plots}
@Q{What visualizations did you find that work with categorical data?}
@A{dot plots and bar charts}
@Q{What visualizations did you find that work with quantitative data?}
@A{histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and lr-plots}
}

Today you've added more data visualizations to your toolbox. You can create dot plots and bar charts to visually display categorical data, and you've developed a general approach to guide you as you create other visualizations.
