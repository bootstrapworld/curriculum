@n Choose Transform Attribute from the drop-down menu.

@vspace{1ex}

@n We want to create a Transformer that will replace all ages less than 1 with the Boolean `true`. In other words, it will _transform_ our "age" column into a column that tells us if an animal is young or not. What is a good name for this Transformer?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{transform-is-young}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Select the dataset you'd like to transform.

@n What attribute will we be transforming? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Age}}

@vspace{1ex}

@star Select the attribute. Notice that CODAP replaced the blank in the starred line of text (left) with the attribute name you selected!

@n What would be an appropriate name for our transformed attribute? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Young`}}

@n The Contract includes a Domain (row) only. What is the Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Boolean`}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's write a Purpose Statement: _Checks each_ @fitb{15em}{@ifsoln{row}} _to see if_ @fitb{}{@ifsoln{age is less than 5.}}

@n What is the expression? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Age < 5`}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Apply, the Transformer, and then Save it.

== More Transforming (On Your Own)

*Create a Transformer called `transform-pounds-kg`. (Note: To convert pounds to kilograms, divide pounds by 2.205.)*

@vspace{1ex}

@n How many kilograms is the heaviest animal in the shelter? _Hint: If you want to see the animals listed in order by weight, select the attribute name and select "Sort Ascending."_

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Kujo is 78 kilograms.}}

@vspace{1ex}

*Create a Transformer called `transform-pounds-round` that uses this expression: `round(Pounds)`.*

@n What do you think the `round` function does? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Pounds were rounded to the nearest whole number.}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*Create a Transformer called `transform-Name+Species` that transforms Name using this expression: `concat(Name, Species).` Let's call the Transformed Attribute `Name+Species`.*

Write a Purpose Statement that describes what this expression does to each row. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Computes `Name+Species`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{by linking together `Name` and `Species` together in a series.}}

@vspace{1ex}

*Create a Transformer to change the number of weeks to adoption to instead show the number of days to adoption.*

@n What is your Purpose Statement? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"Computes the product of `Weeks` and 7."}}

@n What expression will you use? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Weeks * 7`}}
