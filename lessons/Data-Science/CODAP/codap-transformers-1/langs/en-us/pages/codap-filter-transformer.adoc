== Create, Apply, and Save a Filter Transformer (Step by Step)

@n Choose Filter from the drop-down menu that appears (Box 1).

@vspace{1ex}

@n Name the Transformer `filter-is-dog`. Type the name into Box 2 (left).

@vspace{1ex}

@n Click on "Dataset to Filter" to confirm that the Animals Dataset is selected.

@vspace{1ex}

@n The contract's input - or domain - is a Row. Why does that makes sense?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When we filter, we look at each row, one by one.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n The output - or range - is a Boolean. Why does that make sense?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are going to determine if the expression is true or false for each row.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n A purpose statement explains the purpose of the expression. Purpose Statements in CODAP begin with either _"Checks..."_  or _"Computes..."_. With your class, write a purpose statement for this expression. Type it into Box 6.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Checks the row to see if the species is dog}}

|===


@n Enter `Species = "dog"` as the expression (Box 7). Select `Apply Transformer`. What happens? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A copy of the original dataset is created, with only dogs!}}

@n Try typing `species = "dog"` as the expression (instead of `Species = "dog"`). What happens? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_An error message appears that says, "Evaluating `species = "dog"` failed: 'species' is unrecognized."_}}

@n What are some other possible reasons you might get an error message for the expression? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Incorrect spelling, wrong capitalization, forgetting quotation marks._}}

@n Select "Save Transformer." Describe what happens. Why might it be useful to save a Transformer? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}


== More Filtering (On Your Own)

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-old` that creates a new dataset with animals older than 5 years. How many rows does the resulting table have?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are 9 rows. Note: The Purpose Satement should say, "Checks the row to see if age is greater than 5."}}

@n Did you notice anything different as you created `filter-is-old`? For instance, how many datasets appeared in the drop-down menu for you to choose from? How did you decide which dataset to select?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There were two datasets - the one with only dogs, and the original animals dataset. I chose the original animals dataset.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-fixed` that creates a new dataset with only fixed animals. How many fixed animals are there at the shelter?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_There are 18._}}
