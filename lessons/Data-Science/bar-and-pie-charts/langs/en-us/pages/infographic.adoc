= Making an Infographic

@description{Infographics are a powerful tool for communicating information, especially when made by people who actually understand how to connect visuals to data in meaningful ways. Students create their own in this project.}

== Preparing to Create an Infographic

There are four options below for deciding what data will be the basis of your infographic. Your teacher will tell you which options are acceptable for your class.

- Option 1: Build bar or pie charts in @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret from @starter-file{food}} or any of the @link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.html, data sets in our library}.

- Option 2: Find a pie or bar chart on the internet about a topic of interest to use as a starting point.

- Option 3: Build a pie or bar chart in google sheets based on a summary statistic you find about an issue that is of interest and then use the same statistic as the basis of your infographic.

- Option 4: Choose from a list of ratio statements about topics of interest provided by your teacher. You will use that statement in making a bar or pie chart and a corresponding infographic.

== Project Requirements

In making your infographic, be sure to:

- Make your representations to scale!
- Give your infographic a compelling title. The title could read like a newspaper headline that guides the viewer to pay attention to the information you most want them to notice or it could be a question that you want the viewer to think about while looking at your infographic.
- Credit your sources!
- Review the @link{rubric-infographic.html, Infographics Rubric} before you start.

== Strategy 1: Illustrate Ratios using Repeated Images

*Avoid Stereotyping!*

[.indentedpara]

A tricky thing about making infographics with images of people is that not all images accurately represent the diversity of the communities described by the statistics. We encourage the use of silhouetted images in infographics.

*Hint: All percentages are ratios!*

40% is equivalent to 40 out of 100.  If 40% of students wear baseball hats we can show 100 people, of which 40 are wearing hats. Or we could scale 40/100 down to 2/5 and show 5 people of which 2 are wearing hats.

_These examples were created by middle school students at Manhattan Country School._

== Strategy 2: Scale Images on a Grid, as if they were bars on a Bar Graph

@image{../images/empire-state-infographic.png, "infographic: on the left side is a grey image of the Empire State Building, responsible for emissions amounting to 25,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. On the right side we see blue sky and sunshine with slightly more than half of the original Empire State Building, showing that after a retrofit emissions dropped to 15,500 metric tons of CO2 per year.", 600}, @image{../images/dollar-infographic-mona-chalabi.png, "infographic: For every dollar a white man earns... visual shows parts of dollar bills corresponding to the comparable earning of other groups including (from highest to lowest earnings): Asian Men, Asian Women, White Women, Black Men, Native American Men, Black Women, Hispanic Men, Native American Women, Hispanic Women", 270}

== Strategy 3: Use an Area Model

The one for Bratz dolls has a circle inside it, showing that Bratz necks are about 1/7 the diameter of a Bratz head", 620}, @image{../images/space-in-am-mona-chalabi.png, "infographic: Space in America. visual shows a 10x20 rectangle titled _average parking space_ and a 7 x 11 rectangle titled _average solitary confinement cell_", 250}
