////
The refugee charts below are drawn from the Refugee Starter File:
https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=144kvFXVhg9wP1S9Y805s7ra3p1srsAqn&v=4d870d2

The code use to filter the tables and generate them is:
t = refugees-table.filter(lam(r): string-contains(r["region"], "America") end)
stacked-bar-chart(t, "region", "democracy")
multi-bar-chart(t, "region", "democracy")

@n Is it possible that the same data was used for the multi bar charts as for the stacked bar charts? How do you know?
