This page is designed to be used with the @starter-file{expanded-animals}.

== Part A

@n How many tarantulas are male? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{9}} 

@indented{_Hint: Sort the table by `species`!_}

@n How many tarantulas are female? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{11}}

@n Would you imagine that the distribution of male and female animals will be similar for every species at the shelter? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{no idea!}}

@fitb{}{}

== Part B

Sometimes we want to compare _sub-groups across groups_. In this example, we want to compare the distribution of sexes across each species.

@vspace{1ex}

Fortunately, Pyret has two functions that let us specify both a group and a subgroup:

[.indentedpara]
--
@show{(contract 'stacked-bar-chart '((table-name Table) (group String) (subgroup String)) "Image")}

@show{(contract 'multi-bar-chart '((table-name Table) (group String) (subgroup String)) "Image")}
--

@n Make a `stacked-bar-chart` showing the distribution of sexes across species in our shelter.

@n Make a `multi-bar-chart` showing the distribution of sexes across species in our shelter.

@n What do you notice? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students may notice: The snails and clownfish are all hermaphrodites.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{For the other species there are about as many males as females.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{From the `stacked-bar-chart` we have no idea that there are way more dogs than snails.}}

@n What do you wonder? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students may wonder: Is there a reason there are more male dogs? And more female cats? }}

@n Which display would be most efficient for answering the question: "What percentage of cats are female?" Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{stacked bar chart because there's a bar for each species showing the % breakdown of the species by sex}}

@n Which display would be most efficient for answering the question: "Are there more cats or dogs?" Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{multi bar chart because we see bars representing the count of each species by sex.}}

@n Write a question of your own that involves comparing subgroups across groups. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

Which display would be most efficient for answering your question? @fitb{20em}{} Make the display.

What did you learn? @fitb{}{}

@n Write a different question that would be more efficient to answer with the other kind of display. @fitb{}{}

What did you learn from making this display? @fitb{}{}
