== Part A

@n How many cats are male? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{5}} 

@n How many cats are female? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{6}}

@n Would you imagine that there are about as many male dogs as female dogs? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Would you imagine that the distribution of male and female animals will be similar for every species at the shelter? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{no idea!}}

== Part B

Sometimes we want to compare __sub-groups across groups__. In this example, we want to compare the distribution of sexes across each species.

@vspace{1ex}

Fortunately, Pyret has two functions that let us specify both a group and a subgroup:

@vspace{1ex}

[.indentedpara]
--
@show{(contract 'stacked-bar-chart '((table-name Table) (group String) (subgroup String)) "Image")}

@show{(contract 'multi-bar-chart '((table-name Table) (group String) (subgroup String)) "Image")}
--

@n Make a `stacked-bar-chart` showing the distribution of sexes across species in our shelter.

@n Make a `mutli-bar-chart` showing the distribution of sexes across species in our shelter.

@n What do you notice? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students may notice: There are about as many males as females. The snail is hermaphrodite.}}

@n What do you wonder? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students may wonder: Is there a reason there are more male dogs? Are all pet tarantulas female? }}

@n Which display would be most efficient for answering the question: "Are there more male or female cats?"

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{multi bar chart}}

@n Which display would be most efficient for answering the question: "Are there more cats or dogs?"

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{stacked bar chart}}

@n Write a question of your own and decide which display would be most efficient for answering it.
