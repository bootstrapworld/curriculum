Let's make a *bar-chart* to see what we can learn about the distribution of fixed animals and what new questions it may lead us to.

  #:question "Are more animals fixed or unfixed?"
  #:show-question? #t
  #:question-type "arithmetic"
  #:rows "All the rows"

The bar chart shows that there are @fitbruby{18em}{}{more / less / about the same number of} fixed animals @fitbruby{3em}{}{as / than} unfixed animals. 

@vspace{1ex}

Some new questions this raises include:

@fitb{}{How does the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals differ by species?}

@fitb{}{How does the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals differ by...}

@fitb{}{}

Let's make a *stacked-bar-chart* to see what we can learn about the distribution of fixed animals by species and what new questions it leads us to.

The `stacked-bar-chart` shows that @fitbruby{12em}{}{all / most / some / a few / no} species have @fitbruby{15em}{}{more / the same number of / fewer} fixed animals @fitbruby{3em}{}{as / than} unfixed animals.

I also notice @fitb{}{}
