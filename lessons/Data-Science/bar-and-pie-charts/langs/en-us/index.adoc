| Preparation
| 
- Decide whether or not you want to launch this lesson using the *Live Pyret Survey* and your class' own data. If so, follow the instructions on @dist-link{pages/live-pyret-survey-instructions.adoc} to:
  * _Make a copy_ of the @opt-starter-file{bar-and-pie-chart-survey-form} and share it with your class. 
    ** This makes a great "Do Now" as students enter the room, but could also be assigned for homework the night before.
  * _Link the Google Sheet of their responses_ to the @opt-starter-file{bar-and-pie-chart-survey-starter}.
  * _Click "Run"_ and then either:
    ** Project the new Data Visualization they'll be introduced to today. 
    ** Publish the starter file and share a link with your students.

| Key Points for the Facilitator
| This lesson uses the @starter-file{expanded-animals}, which includes far more animals than the smaller sample represented in the animals starter file used in most of our lessons. 

| Optional Project
| 
- @lesson-link{project-infographic}: Infographics are a powerful tool for communicating information, especially when made by people who actually understand how to connect visuals to data in meaningful ways. This project is an opportunity for students to become more flexible math thinkers while tapping into their creativity. It can be done on the computer or with pencil and paper.

| Relevant Resources
| 
- @link{Bar v Pie Chart Comparison, https://barvpie.netlify.app/?numbers=10,20,40}: A tiny teaching tool created by Evan Peck. Powered by Chart.js. that quickly generates side by side charts from any simple dataset that you enter as a list of numbers

@objective{interpret-bar}
@objective{interpret-pie}
@objective{pros-cons-bar-pie}

=== Overview
Students learn one way of grouping data, showing the @vocab{frequency} of values in a dataset using bar and pie charts.

=== Launch

@ifproglang{pyret}{
@opt-block{
@teacher{
If you decided to launch today's class using our *Live Pyret Survey*, now is the time!

When you click "Run", the @opt-starter-file{bar-and-pie-chart-survey-starter} builds a `bar-chart` and `pie-chart` side-by-side. 

@indented{
Assuming you've already...

1. Followed the @dist-link{pages/live-pyret-survey-instructions.adoc, Instructions to Set up and Link the Files} +
2. Shared the *link you made to your class' copy* of the @opt-starter-file{bar-and-pie-chart-survey-form}

The data visualizations will be generated using data from your students! +
And they will continue to update in real time as more of your students complete the Google Form.
}

Project your screen and/or publish the starter file and share a link with your students.

Facilitate a discussion about this new-to-them Pyret Data Visualization!
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the *Google Form Survey* link I shared and submit your response.
- Then look at the Survey Results being displayed in the new Data Visualization on the Board.
- What do you Notice?
- What do you Wonder?
}
}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{expanded-animals} and click "Run".
- Then complete Part A of @printable-exercise{count-bar-pie.adoc}, by testing the expressions @show{(code '(count more-animals "species"))} and @show{(code '(bar-chart more-animals "species"))} in the Interactions Area.
}

@slidebreak
@QandA{
@Q{How do the frequency table and bar chart you just made compare?}
@A{The height of each bar matches the frequency with which each species occurs at the shelter.}
@Q{How does this pie chart compare to the bar chart you just made?}
@A{The wedges show the frequency as a _percentage_, whereas the bar chart shows the frequency as a count of each value. It's easy to compare one bar to another, but harder to compare the frequency of any one bar against the whole sample. The pie chart is the opposite: it's easy to see how a single wedge compares to the whole pie, but more difficult to see how one wedge compares to another.}

=== Investigate

@opt{Have students complete @opt-printable-exercise{bar-chart-notice.adoc} and @opt-printable-exercise{pie-chart-notice.adoc}.
}

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @printable-exercise{bar-and-pie-notice.adoc} and take two minutes to notice and wonder about the visualizations. Then compare your Notices and Wonders with your partner.

@slidebreak

@image{images/count-more-species.png, 160} @image{images/bar-more-species.png, 385}

Both `bar-chart` and `count` *group the data in one column by value*, creating "buckets" showing the frequency of each unique value. One uses a picture, and one uses a table.

@define{about-interactive-visualizations}{When you first build a bar chart or pie chart in pyret, they are interactive visualizations of the data. That means that you can mouse over a bar to reveal the label, as well as the number of animals in that species. We can also resize the window by dragging its borders. This allows us to experiment with the data before closing the window and generating the final, non-interactive image.}

@ifnotslide{@about-interactive-visualizations}

@lesson-point{
@vocab{Bar charts} group data _by value_ to show frequency.
}

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/pie-more-species.png, 275}}@vocab{Pie charts} show us the @vocab{percentage} of the data points that fall in each category. Hovering over a pie slice reveals the label, as well as the frequency and the percentage of the whole. In this example we see that there is 1 animal that is a snail, representing 3.1% of the population.

@lesson-point{
Pie charts group data _by value_ to show frequency as a percentage.
}

@define{infer}{
If our data is based on sample data from a larger population, we can use these charts to _infer_ the proportion of a whole population that might belong to each category. For example, the distribution of species in our shelter might help us make guesses about the distribution of species in other shelters.

While bars in some bar charts should follow some logical order (alphabetical, small-medium-large, etc), the pie slices and bars can really be placed in _any_ order, without changing the meaning of the chart.}

}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What information is provided in bar charts that is hidden in pie charts?}
@A{Categories containing 0% of the data aren't represented on a pie chart.}

@Q{Why might it sometimes be problematic to use a pie chart, thereby hiding a category?} 
@A{If, for example, a sector of the population is unrepresented in positions of power, it's easier to ignore the issue if that population doesn't get represented in the display.}

@Q{Why isn't it useful to group the `pounds` column using `bar-chart` or `pie-chart`?}
@A{Grouping by value works well for @vocab{categorical data}, when lots of different data points can be sorted into a smaller number of buckets. But for @vocab{quantitative data} - which can have lots of different values - the number of buckets is too large to be useful.}

=== Common Misconceptions

@ifslide{*Common Misconceptions*}

- Bar charts look a lot like another kind of chart - called a "histogram" - which are actually quite different because they display _quantitative_ data, not categorical. @ifnotslide{_This lesson focuses entirely on pie- and bar charts._}
- When comparing bar charts, it is important to read the scales on the y-axes. If the scales do not match, a taller bar may not represent a larger value.
- The percentages on pie charts will always add to 100%, so if there are 5 subgroups of a population and we're only going to look at data from 2 of the subgroups, it wouldn't make sense to use a pie chart to compare them!
- Relatedly, pie charts only have a wedge for each category whose population is large enough to claim a percentage of the pie. Unlike in bar charts, empty categories will not be included in a pie chart. 

=== Synthesize

- How is `pie-chart` similar to `bar-chart`? How is it different?
- When would you want to use one chart instead of another?
- Which visualizations do you find it easier to interpret? Why?
- What questions about the dataset are you curious to investigate using these visualizations?

@teacher{
For another look at when a bar or pie chart might be more useful, you could project @link{https://barvpie.netlify.app/?numbers=200,20,40,105,10,60,250,115} and ask students:

- What question(s) would be easier to answer from the pie chart?
- What question(s) would be easier to answer from the bar chart?
}

@strategy{Optional Extension}{


Sometimes we want to visualize data that is _already summarized:_

[.pyret-table,cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Hair Color		| Number of Students
| "Black"			| 5
| "Brown"			| 13
| "Blond"			| 4
| "Red"				| 2
| "Pink"			| 1
|===

In this situation, we want to use the values in the _first_ column for the labels of our pie slices or bars, and the values in the _second_ column for the size. We have contracts for those, too:
@show{(contract 'pie-chart-summarized '((table-name Table) (labels String) (values String)) "Image" )}
@show{(contract 'bar-chart-summarized '((table-name Table) (labels String) (values String)) "Image" )}

Open the @opt-starter-file{hair} to try them out!

}


== Groups and Subgroups
@objective{compound-categorical-visualizations-proglang}
@objective{interpret-multi-bar}
@objective{interpret-stacked-bar}
=== Overview
Students learn how to create _groups within groups_, showing the relative frequency of one variable across values of another variable using stacked and multi bar charts.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{Turn to @printable-exercise{intro-stacked-multi.adoc} and complete Part A now.
}

@slidebreak

Comparing groups is great, but sometimes we want to compare _sub-groups across groups_. In this example, we want to compare the distribution of sexes across each species.

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's step away from the Animals Dataset for a moment to learn about some new kinds of data visualizations that would make it easier to answer questions like these by revealing the subgroups in a column. Turn to @printable-exercise{stacked-and-multi-notice.adoc}.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
}

=== Investigate

Pyret has two functions that let us specify both a group and a subgroup:

@show{(contract 'stacked-bar-chart '((table-name Table) (group String) (subgroup String)) "Image")}

@show{(contract 'multi-bar-chart '((table-name Table) (group String) (subgroup String)) "Image")}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete Part B of @printable-exercise{intro-stacked-multi.adoc}
}

@slidebreak

[cols="1a,1a", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
^| Stacked Bar Chart
^| Multi Bar Chart
^| @image{images/stacked-species-sex2.png, 300}
^| @image{images/multi-species-sex2.png, 300}
| Stacked Bar Charts put the _groups_ side by side, so it's easy to answer which species is the "most female". But it's more difficult to see whether there are more female dogs than male cats, because the bars don't all start from the bottom and they're in percentages rather than raw quantities.
| Multi Bar Charts put the _subgroups_ side by side, so it's easy to answer whether there are more female dogs than male cats in the shelter. But it's a little more difficult to see which species is the "most female", because we have to estimate the relative lengths of each bar.
|===


=== Synthesize
All of the charts we've looked at in this lesson work with @vocab{categorical data}, showing us the frequency of values in one or two groups.

- What are some of the questions you asked about the animals dataset using these visualizations? And what did you learn?
- What kinds of questions need stacked or multi bar charts, rather than pie or bar charts
- What kinds of questions are better answered by stacked bar charts?
- What kinds of questions are better answered by multi bar charts?

== Additional Exercises  

- For more practice making and interpreting these chart types in Pyret, we have a second teaching dataset for you to work with! You can have students create additional visualizations using @opt-starter-file{food}.
- For more practice without a computer, have students turn to @opt-printable-exercise{matching-stacked-to-multi.adoc}.
