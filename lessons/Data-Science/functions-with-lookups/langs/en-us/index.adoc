== Row and Column Lookups

=== Overview
Students review value definitions in Pyret, and practice extracting individual Rows for later use. They are also introduced to _column lookups_, which allow them to extract a specific value from a Row.

=== Launch

You've learned how to write functions that work with Numbers, Strings, and Images. But as Data Scientists, we want to write functions that work with _Rows_. To do that, we'll need to take Rows apart and use the values stored in their columns.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{row-functions} and click "Run".
- In the Interactions Area, evaluate a few of the sample rows you see defined in the file.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What are the names of the sample rows you see defined?}
@A{`cat-row`, `dog-row`, etc.}

@Q{What function is used to extract a row from the table?}
@A{`row-n`}

@Q{What row would `row-n(animals-table, 1)` return?}
@A{The second row.}
}

@slidebreak

Notice that we could have defined the first row from the animals table using:

`sasha = row-n(animals-table, 0)`

But, it's often more useful to name our Row definitions according to the _property we care about_. In this case, the fact that this row is a cat is _much_ more interesting than the fact that her name is Sasha, so the starter file uses:

`cat-row = row-n(animals-table, 0)`


@slidebreak

If we were analyzing a subset of lizards, it would make sense to add a definition for `lizard-row` to the Animals Dataset.

@lesson-instruction{
- If you were to adopt an animal from the shelter, who would be your favorite?
- Define a new Row called `myPet`, to be your favorite animal at the shelter.
}

@slidebreak

We can access _specific columns_ of a Row, by using a *Row Accessor*.

- Row accessors start with a row value:
  ** either a `row-n` expression just like the ones we've been working with
  ** or the name of a row that we have already defined
- Row accessors end with square brackets `[ ]` containing the name of the column where the value can be found.

Here are three examples that use row accessors to get at different columns from the first row in the animals-table.

| Without Predefined Rows
| Using Predefined Rows

```
row-n(animals-table, 0)["name"]
row-n(animals-table, 0)["age"]
row-n(animals-table, 0)["fixed"]
```

|

```
cat-row = row-n(animals-table, 0)

cat-row["name"]
cat-row["age"]
cat-row["fixed"]
```

|===
}

=== Investigate

Sometimes we want to ask questions about a specific Row, or do some computations with that Row:

- Is the age of our `lizard-row` animal more than 3?
- How many _kilograms_ does our `rabbit-row` weigh?
- Is the species of our `fixed-row` animal a `"dog"`?
- Could we use the `age` of our `male-row` as the size of a solid, green triangle?

We can use our knowledge of lookups, operators and functions to do just that!

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{lookup-questions-matching.adoc} and find the `pets-table` at the top of the page. All of the questions on this page will refer back to that table.
- Complete the page, discussing your thinking with a partner.
}

@teacher{Confirm that students have correctly complete the page before moving on. If they need more matching practice before moving on have them complete @opt-printable-exercise{more-practice-w-lookups.adoc}, which focuses on the `shapes-table`.}

Now that we know how to lookup a value for a specific column of a row, let's practice some of the things we might be able to do with that information!

@lesson-instruction{
- Return to the @starter-file{row-functions}, and turn to @printable-exercise{lookup-expressions.adoc}.
- Notice that the code at the top of the page uses the "age" of `old-row` to determine the size of the triangle.
- Type the code into the Interactions Area and test it out.
- With a partner, work through @printable-exercise{lookup-expressions.adoc}. After you've written the expressions on paper, try them out in Pyret!
}

@teacher{
Have students share their most creative uses of lookups. Did anyone use three or more columns from a Row? Did anyone use more than one Row in the same expression?
}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Why is it helpful to be able to lookup values from a Row?}
@A{Once we have the values, we can use them with any Pyret expression we want!}
@A{We can perform computation on those values, make images, etc.}
}

== Defining Functions

=== Overview
Students use different representations of functions to define functions that consume _Rows_, discover _functions that consume other functions_, and compose a scatter plot function with a function they've defined.

=== Launch

By now you've had a chance to explore functions on your own, thinking of them in terms of several different representations:

- A mapping between _Domain_ and _Range_
- A list of discrete _input values_ and _output values_
- A symbolic _definition_

Now it's time to use those representations to help us work with Rows!

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{row-functions}, save a copy, and click "Run".
- Scroll until you see the definition for `cat-row`. What will you get back if you evaluate `cat-row` in the Interactions Area?
- What species is the animal?
- What is its name?
- How old is it?
- Complete the top half of @printable-exercise{functions-with-lookups.adoc}.
}

=== Investigate

Let's look at an example to see how lookups can work hand-in-hand with function definitions!

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the `age-gt` section of @printable-exercise{functions-with-lookups.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
If students are stuck on the examples step, here's a useful trick to get them started. +
Complete the following sentence: +
"_For this Row, I..._" +
Whatever you answer is the precise description of what to do for your example!
}

@slidebreak

```
# CONTRACT:
# age-gt :: Row -> Image
# consumes an animal, and draws a solid green triangle whose
# size is 5x the number age of the animal as the size

examples:
  age-gt(cat-row) is triangle(5 *          1,     "solid", "green")
  age-gt(dog-row) is triangle(5 *          3,     "solid", "green")

  age-gt(cat-row) is triangle(5 * cat-row["age"], "solid", "green")
  age-gt(dog-row) is triangle(5 * dog-row["age"], "solid", "green")
end

fun age-gt(r):       triangle(5 *       r["age"], "solid", "green") end

```

@teacher{Review student answers from the `age-gt` section of @printable-exercise{functions-with-lookups.adoc}.}

Both pairs of examples are _correct_!

- In the first pair, we see the values 1 and 3, which makes it easy for us picture the two triangles... but there's no explanation of where the values are coming from.
- The last pair shows how those values are _looked up_ from the example rows, which makes it easier to write a definition that the computer can use for any row!

@slidebreak

@ifslide{

```
# CONTRACT:
# age-gt :: Row -> Image
# consumes an animal, and draws a solid green triangle whose
# size is 5x the number age of the animal as the size

examples:
  age-gt(cat-row) is triangle(5 *          1,     "solid", "green")
  age-gt(dog-row) is triangle(5 *          3,     "solid", "green")

  age-gt(cat-row) is triangle(5 * cat-row["age"], "solid", "green")
  age-gt(dog-row) is triangle(5 * dog-row["age"], "solid", "green")
end

fun age-gt(r):       triangle(5 *       r["age"], "solid", "green") end

```
}

*You can use both kinds of examples in your code! Programmers often use a mix of the two.*

- Sometimes we want to use real, concrete numbers to make sure our work is correct.
- And sometimes we need to show all of our work, to make sure we are defining the function correctly!

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Why might it be beneficial to include both kinds of examples?}
@A{They serve different purposes.}
@A{The concrete examples make our code more readable for humans and might help us to establish and verify our line of thinking.}
@A{And showing all the work in examples makes the pattern evident for defining the function.}
}
