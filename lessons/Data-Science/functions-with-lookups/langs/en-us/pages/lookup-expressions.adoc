Make sure you've opened your *saved copy* of the @starter-file{row-functions}. The Definitions Area will contain sample Rows such as `lizard-row`, `old-row`, etc.

[.tightAndCentered]
The code below draws a solid, green triangle, using 5x the age of `old-row` as the size: +
`triangle(old-row["age"], "solid", "green")`

@vspace{3ex}

*For each of the prompts below _write the code_ on the blank lines that will produce the desired result.* The first one has been done for you.

@n An animal is "old" if it is greater than 10 years old. Is `lizard-row` old? +
@fitb{}{`lizard-row["age"] > 10`}

@n An animal is "young" if it is less than 1 year old. Is `female-row` young? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`female-row["age"] < 1`}}

@n Using `male-row`, draw a solid, blue circle where the radius is the `age` of the row. +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`circle(male-row["age"], "solid", "blue")`}}

@n If every week is 7 days, how many _days_ did it take for our `rabbit-row` to be adopted? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`rabbit-row["weeks"] * 7`}}

@n If every 2.2 pounds is 1 kilogram, how many _kilograms_ does our `rabbit-row` weigh? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`rabbit-row["pounds"] / 2.2`}}

@n Is the species of our `fixed-row` animal a `"dog"`? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`fixed-row["species"] == "dog"`}}

@n Is the species of our `young-row` animal a `"cat"`? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`young-row["species"] == "cat"`}}

@n Using `male-row`, draw the species of the animal in red, 15px letters. +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(male-row["species"], 15, "red")`}}

@n Is `lizard-row` fixed? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`lizard-row["fixed"] == true` (or just `lizard-row["fixed"]`!)}}

@n If a year has 52 weeks, how many _years_ did it take `unfixed-row` to be adopted? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`unfixed-row["weeks"] / 52`}}

@n Does `old-row` have an "s" in its name? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`string-contains(old-row["name"], "s")`}}

@n Using any Row you like, draw the `name` of the animal in red letters and use the `pounds` of the animal for the font size. +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(cat-row["name"], cat-row["pounds"], "red")`}}

@star Draw a solid pink star, using the age of `dog-row` as the radius. Rotate it by the number of pounds it weighs. +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`rotate(dog-row["pounds"], star(dog-row["age"], "solid", "pink"))`}}

@star @star Get creative.
 Choose one defined Row and think of as many ways as you can to use its columns!
