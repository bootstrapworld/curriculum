= Computing Standard Deviation (2)

Here are ten different family incomes: _$43k, $62k, $39k, $141k, $58k, $82k, $41k, $73k, $68k, $73k_

@n Draw the *distribution* of these incomes by placing a dot on the number line below. If two families have the same income, put one dot on top of the other. Finally, draw a @vocab{box plot} on the number line, making sure to label the axis and show each quartile.

@n Describe the shape of this box-plot. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{right skew}}

@n What is the mean income of the families in this dataset? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{$68k}}

@n How many families earn $39k? $43k? Fill in the table below. The first column has been done for you.

@n *Draw a star to locate the mean on the number line above*.

@n For each family on the number line you drew, 

- *Draw a horizontal arrow* under the axis from the star you drew in #5 to the dot for that family's income
- *Label the arrow with its distance from the mean*. +
_e.g. if the mean is $50k and a family's income is $82k, your arrow would stretch from $50k to $82k, and be labeled with the distance "$32k"_

@vspace{1ex}

*To compute the standard deviation we square each distance and take the average, then take the square root of the average.*


@n For each of the 10 incomes in the table below, list the distance-from-mean for each income, using the mean you computed above. Then fill in the squared distance in the next row to complete the table.

@n Add all the squared distances. What is their sum? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{7,906}}

@n There are N=10 distances. What is N-1? @fitb{4rem}{@ifsoln{9}} @hspace{2rem} Divide the sum by _N-1_. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~878.44}}

@n Take the square root to find the *standard deviation*! @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~29.64}}
