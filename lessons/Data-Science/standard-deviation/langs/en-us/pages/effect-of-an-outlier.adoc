= The Effect of an Outlier

The histogram below shows the ages of eleven cats at the shelter:

@ifnotsoln{@image{../images/histogram-with-outlier.png, 100%}}

@n Describe the shape of this histogram. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{slight right skew}}

@n How many cats are 1 year old? 2 years old? Fill in the table below by reading the histogram. The first column has been done for you.

@n What is the mean age of the cats in this histogram? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~4.2}}

@n *Draw a star to identify the mean on the histogram above*.

@n For each cat in the histogram above, *draw a horizontal arrow* from the mean to the cat's interval, and *label the arrow with its distance from the mean*. (If the mean is 2 and a cat is 5 years old, your arrow would stretch from 2 to 5, and be labeled with the distance "3")

@lesson-point{
To compute the standard deviation we square each distance and take the average, then take the square root of the average.
}

@n Recorded the 11 ages shown in the histogram in the first row of the table below. For each age, compute the distance from the mean and the squared distance.

@n Add all the squared distances. What is their sum? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{207.64}}

@n Divide the sum by _N-1_. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{20.764}}

@n Take the square root to find the *standard deviation*! @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~4.56}}

@n How did the outlier impact the standard deviation? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The outlier caused the standard deviation to increase.}}
