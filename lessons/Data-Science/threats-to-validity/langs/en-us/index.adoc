== Threats to Validity @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the concept of _validity_, and a number of possible threats that might make an analysis invalid.

=== Launch

As good Data Scientists, the staff at the animal shelter are constantly gathering data about their animals, their volunteers, and the people who come to visit. 

But just because they have data doesn’t mean the conclusions they draw from it are correct! 

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
Suppose the shelter staff surveyed 1,000 cat-owners and found that 95% of them thought cats were the best pet. 

Could they really claim that people generally prefer cats to dogs?
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{
There’s more to data analysis than simply collecting data and crunching numbers.
} 

In the example of the cat-owning survey, the claim that “people prefer cats to dogs” is *invalid* because the data itself wasn’t representative of the whole population (of course cat-owners are partial to cats!). 

@slidebreak

*There are several major @vocab{Threats to Validity} you should be on guard against:*

(1) *Selection bias* - Data was gathered from a biased sample of the population. This is the problem with surveying _cat owners_ to find out which animal is most loved!

(2) *Bias in the study design* - Data was gathered using a “loaded” question like “Since annual vet care comes to about $300 for dogs and only about half of that for cats, would you say that owning a cat is less of a burden than owning a dog?” This could easily lead to a misrepresentation of people’s true opinions.

@ifslide{@teacher{The list continues on the next slide.}}
@slidebreak

(3) *Poor choice of summary data* - Even if the selection is unbiased, sometimes outliers are so extreme that they make the mean completely useless at best - and misleading at worst.

(4) *Confounding variables* - A study might find that cat owners are more likely to use public transportation than dog owners. But it's not that owning a cat means you drive less: people who live in big cities are more likely to use public transportation, _and_ also more likely to own cats.

@teacher{
More examples of confounding variables can be found in the @lesson-link{correlations, correlations lesson}: @opt-printable-exercise{correlations/pages/correlation-is-not-causation.adoc}.
}

And there are many other threats to validity out there!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- On @printable-exercise{threats-to-validity-1.adoc} and @printable-exercise{threats-to-validity-2.adoc}, you’ll find four different claims backed by four different datasets.
- Each one of those claims suffers from a serious threat to validity. 
- Work with your partner to identify each of the four threats.
- @opt{Respond to @opt-printable-exercise{selection-bias-v-biased-study.adoc}}
}

@strategy{Optional Project: When Data Science Goes Bad}{
In this @lesson-link{project-threats}, students pretend to be terrible data scientists who develop and support claims based on faulty sampling techniques (selection bias, bias in the study design, poor choice of summary data, and confounding variables). This is a fun opportunity for your students to demonstrate their understanding of the impact of various threats to validity.
}

@slidebreak

Life is messy, and there are _always_ threats to validity. 

Data Science is about doing the best you can to minimize those threats, and to be up front about what they are whenever you publish a finding. 

When you do your own analysis, make sure you include a discussion of the threats to validity!

=== Synthesize

Why is it important to consider potential threats to validity?

== Fake News! @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are asked to consider the ways in which statistics are misused in popular culture, and become critical consumers of some statistical claims. Finally, they are given the opportunity to misuse their _own_ statistics, to better understand how someone might distort data for their own ends.

=== Launch

You have already seen a number of ways that statistics can be misused:

(1) *Using the mean instead of the median* with heavily-skewed data

(2) *Using a correlation to imply causation*

(3) *Misexplaining the r-value from Linear Regression* as corresponding to something happening "some percentage of the time" instead of describing "the percentage of the variation that is explained by the explanatory variable"

@slidebreak

There are other ways to mislead the audience as well:

(4) *Intentionally using the wrong chart* - suppose the census asks for data from different groups of people, and gets _none_ from one group. That would be very suspicious! That group would show up as an empty space on bar chart, making the absence visible. A pie chart, however, would hide that absence completely - making it less likely that anyone would even notice that group had been "erased"!

(5) *Changing the scale of a chart* - Changing the y-axis of a scatter plot can make the slope of the regression line seem smaller: "look, that line is basically flat anyway!"

With all the news being shared through newspapers, television, radio, and social media, it’s important to be critical consumers of information!

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
- On @printable-exercise{fake-news.adoc}, you’ll find some deliberately misleading claims made by slimy Data Scientists. 
  * Identify why each of these claims should not be trusted.
- Once you’ve finished, turn to @printable-exercise{lies-darned-lies-n-statistics.adoc}.
  * Come up with four misleading claims based on data or displays from your dataset.
- Trade papers with another group, and see if you can figure out why each other’s claims are not to be trusted!
}

- What "lies" did you tell?
- Was anyone able to stump the other group?

=== Synthesize

- Where have you seen statistics misused in the real world?
- Over the next several weeks, keep your eyes peeled for misused statistics and bring the examples you find to class to share!
