There are three separate, _unrelated_ claims below, and ALL OF THEM ARE WRONG! Your job is to figure out why by looking at the data.

| Why it's Fake

| @n
| @centered-image{../images/wrong-scale.png} "Stocks fell off a cliff today, plummeting sharply. Some fear the economic unrest will lead to rioting and looting!"
| @ifsoln{*Wrong scale!* The y-axis goes starts at 33840, not zero! That makes it look like the drop is huge, but it's only -0.78%!}

| @n
| @centered-image{../images/fake-news-bar.png} “According to this bar chart, Felix makes up a little more than 15% of the total ages of all the animals in the dataset.”
| @ifsoln{*Incorrect Interpretation!* Bar charts show the absolute quantity for some category (in this case, the number of years for each animal). That means that Felix is *15 years old*, not that his age makes up 15% of the total ages!}

| @n
| @centered-image{../images/fake-news-hist.png} “According to this histogram, most animals weigh between 40 and 60 pounds.”
| @ifsoln{*Incorrect Interpretation!* The 40-60 pound bin has more animals than any other bin, but it makes up only a small fraction of the whole.}
