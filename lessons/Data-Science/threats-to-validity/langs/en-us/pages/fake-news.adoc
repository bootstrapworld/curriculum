| What's Wrong

| *@n*
| The average player on a basketball team is 6′1″.
| _“Most of the players are taller than 6′.”_
| @ifsoln{*Wrong measure of center!* Average (mean) is highly sensitive to outliers. Most players could be under 6 feet tall, with one 6-foot-10 player throwing off the mean. }

| *@n*
| Linear regression found a positive correlation (r=0.42) between people’s height and salary.
| _“Taller people are more qualified for their jobs.”_
| @ifsoln{ *Using a correlation to imply causation!* Also, there may be _biases_ at work relating height to salary which have nothing to do with how qualified a person is! }

| *@n*
| @centered-image{../images/fake-news-3.png}
| _“According to the predictor function indicated here, the value on the x-axis will predict the value on the y-axis 63.6% of the time.”_
| @ifsoln{*Incorrectly explaining the r-value!* R-Values tell us how much of the _variability_ in the response is explained by the predictor, *not how accurate it is!*}

| *@n*
| @centered-image{../images/wrong-use-of-chart.png}
| _"Despite El Paso High School being near the Mexican border, researchers were surprised to find that Haitian Creole was the most-commonly spoken language (after English). The data came from the principal, who said she took a sample of 67 students, to find what languages they spoke at home."_
| @ifsoln{*Wrong use of chart!* Despite six languages being in the legend, there are only five pie slices! That means *zero* students in the sample spoke Spanish, which suggests that this was not a representative sample. A bar chart would have made this really obvious!}

| *@n*
| @centered-image{../images/wrong-scale.png, 400}
| _"Stocks fell off a cliff today, plummeting sharply. Some fear the economic unrest will lead to rioting and looting!"_
| @ifsoln{*Wrong scale!* The y-axis goes starts at 33840, not zero! That makes it look like the drop is huge, but it's only -0.78%!}
