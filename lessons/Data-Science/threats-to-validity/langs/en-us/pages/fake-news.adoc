The _unrelated_ claims below are ALL WRONG! Your job is to figure out why by looking at the data.

| Why it's Fake

| @n
| @centered-image{../images/fake-news-lr.png, 200} “According to the predictor function indicated here, the value on the x-axis will predict the value on the y-axis 63.6% of the time.”
| @ifsoln{*Incorrectly explaining the r-value!* R-Values tell us how much of the _variability_ in the response is explained by the predictor, *not how accurate it is!*}

| @n
| The average player on the Cranston East basketball team is 6′1″, so we know that most of the players are taller than 6′!
| @ifsoln{*Wrong measure of center!* Average (mean) is highly sensitive to outliers. Most players could be under 6 feet tall, with one 6-foot-10 player throwing off the mean. }

| @n
| Linear regression found a positive correlation (r=0.42) between people’s height and salary, so businesses are recognizing that taller people are more qualified.
| @ifsoln{ *Using a correlation to imply causation!* Also, there may be _biases_ at work relating height to salary which have nothing to do with how qualified a person is! }

| @star
| @centered-image{../images/wrong-use-of-chart.png} "Despite El Paso High School being near the Mexican border, a sample of 67 students found that Haitian Creole was the most-commonly spoken language at home (after English)."
| @ifsoln{*Wrong use of chart!* Despite six languages being in the legend, there are only five pie slices! That means *zero* students in the sample spoke Spanish, which suggests that this was not a representative sample. A bar chart would have made this really obvious!}
