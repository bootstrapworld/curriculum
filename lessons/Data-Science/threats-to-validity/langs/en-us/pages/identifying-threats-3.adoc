= Identifying Threats to Validity (3)

@vspace{1ex}

Data scientists want to know if listening to music or podcasts reduces symptoms of stress in individuals. 

- They conducted *a study of 1,000 people who were brought into a laboratory office for testing*. 

- While wearing a heart-rate monitor, participants were asked to listen to either music or a podcast of their choosing while completing a series of complicated puzzles. 

- The data scientists discovered that on average, *participants who listened to music had a 5% lower heart rate while completing the tasks than those who listened to podcasts*.

Before publishing their findings, the data scientists have asked you to review their claim. In the space below, indicate possible *threats to validity* faced by this study.

*Sample responses:*

Sample error: Participants’ response to stimuli may be wildly different in a lab setting than it would be in another location.

Type of music wasn't controlled. e.g. heavy metal vs. classical music would be very different on heart rate.

Type of podcast was not controlled. e.g. listening to a politically-charged one vs. a relaxing fun story would have different impact on the heart rate.

If people hate puzzles or love puzzles could impact heart rate -- frustration vs. pleasure at the task.
