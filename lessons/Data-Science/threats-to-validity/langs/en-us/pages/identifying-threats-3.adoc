= Identifying Threats to Validity (3)

@vspace{1ex}

Data scientists want to know if listening to music or podcasts reduces symptoms of stress in individuals. 

- They conducted *a study of 1,000 people who were brought into a laboratory office for testing*. 

- While wearing a heart-rate monitor, participants were asked to listen to either music or a podcast of their choosing while completing a series of complicated puzzles. 

- The data scientists discovered that on average, *participants who listened to music had a 5% lower heart rate while completing the tasks than those who listened topodcasts*.
