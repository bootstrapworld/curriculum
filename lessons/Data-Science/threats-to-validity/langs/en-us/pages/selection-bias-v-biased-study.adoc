= Selection Bias or Biased Study?

The school newspaper ran an article stating that chicken was more popular than pork in the East Village.

*Kendell thinks the study was biased.*

@indented{
_Would you rather eat pork or delicious crispy fried chicken?_ That's such a leading question! It encouraged people to pick chicken. I bet the results would have been different if they had asked about crispy bacon!

*Carson thinks the study suffered from selection bias.*

@indented{
One of the survey sites was outside of a mosque?! Muslims don't even eat pork!

*Who's right? How do you know?*

@ifsoln{Lots of studies suffer from multiple threats to validity! And it's possible that Kendell and Carson are both right! But, including one survey location that's outside of a mosque doesn't necessarily mean there's selection bias. If there's a Muslim population in the neighborhood, you'd certainly want to make sure to survey Muslims as part of your study! It would be selection bias if you only surveyed people outside of the mosque or if the number of Muslims you surveyed was disproportionate to the number of Muslims in the neighborhood.}
