= Simple Data Types

CODAP is a web-based data science tool that runs in your web browser.

== Data Types
CODAP utilizes different @vocab{data types}, including Numbers, Strings, and Booleans.

	- Numbers are values like `1`, `0.4`, `1/3`, and `-8261.003`.

	** Numbers are _usually_  used for quantitative data and other values are _usually_  used as categorical data.

	- Strings are values like `"Emma"`, `"Rosanna"`, `"Jen and Ed"`, or even `"08/28/1980"`.

	** All strings _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks.

	- Booleans are either `true` or `false`.

All values evaluate to themselves. The program `42` will evaluate to `42`, the String `"Hello"` will evaluate to `"Hello"`, and the Boolean `false` will evaluate to `false`.

== Operators

Operators (like `+`, `-`, `<`, etc.) work the same way that they do in math.

	- Operators are written between values, for example: `4 + 2`.

== Expressions

Expressions work the same way that they do in math. Numeric expressions can be _evaluated_.

	- The following are all examples of expressions: `sqrt(16)`, `sqrt(Weight)`, `m+5`, and `9+17`.
