Let's say we want to predict what each animal will weigh if its weight doubles. We could take out a calculator or do some computation with paper and pencil! Fill in the portion of the Animals table below, computing each animal's weight, doubled.

@vspace{1ex}

[.FillVerticalSpace,cols="^.^5,^.^5,^.^5", stripes="none", options="header"]
|===

| Animal
| Pounds
| Pounds doubled

| Sasha
| 6.5
| @ifsoln{13}

| Snuffles
| 3.5
| @ifsoln{7}

| Mittens
| 7.4
| @ifsoln{14.8}

| Sunflower
| 8.1
| @ifsoln{16.2}


|===

@vspace{1ex}

It would be quite time-consuming to do this for the entire table! Instead, we can let CODAP do the work! All we would have to do is click on the column header for `Pounds doubled`, select `Edit Formula` from the drop down menu, and input `Pounds * 2`. Go to the @starter-file{expressions-functions} to try it out.

@n Why do you think the word `Pounds` has a different color than the rest of the formula? Does `pounds` (lower-case `p`) appear in a special color? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{'Pounds' appeared in pink, because CODAP recognizes that is an attribute in the dataset. Case matters!}}

@n The second table has a column titled `Weeks increased by 2`. What formula will populate the column according to its description?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`Weeks + 2`}}

@n Now, let's revisit the @starter-file{animals} and think of other scenarios where it would be useful to enter an expression or function as the formula for a new attribute. Write down one possible scenario. @fitb{}{}

== Applying Functions

@vspace{1ex}

In order to answer each of the questions below, you must first create a new column in @starter-file{animals}. Click on the attribute name for that new column and choose `Edit Formula` from the drop-down menu that appears. You will be typing into the `Edit Formula` box.

@n Enter `sqrt(16)` into the `Edit Formula` box. How many arguments does `sqrt` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_1_}}

@n What type of argument does the function `sqrt` expect? @fitbruby{30em}{@ifsoln{Number}}{Number? String? Boolean?}

@n What type of output does `sqrt` produce? @fitbruby{30em}{@ifsoln{Number}}{Number? String? Boolean?}

@n Which of these expressions will successfully populate a column?

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| @ifsoln-choice{`sqrt(Weight)`}
| @ifsoln-choice{`sqrt(Legs)`}
| `sqrt(Name)`
|===

@n Why will some of these expressions work and some generate errors? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root when the attribute provided is numerical, but CODAP produces an error message when given a string, because it can only calculate the square root of a number._}}


== Putting it all together

@vspace{1ex}

- Create a column called `age-next-year` that uses an expression to add one year to each animalâ€™s age.

@vspace{1ex}

- Create a column called `rounded-weight` that uses a function to give the weight of each animal rounded to the nearest whole number.

@vspace{1ex}

- Create a column called `old` that uses a Boolean to indicate which animals are over 5 years old.
