Complete the tables, below. In the first table, @math{y = x + 1}. In the second table, @math{y = 4x + 5}. When you're finished, check your work by editing the formula for @math{y} in the Applying Functions starter file.

== More Functions

Make sure youâ€™re logged into CODAP, and have created a new column titled `test` in the Animals Dataset. *In order to answer each of these questions, you must first select `test`, and then choose `Edit formula` from the drop-down menu that appears.* You will be typing into the `Edit Formula` box.

`sqrt(16)`

@n How many arguments does `sqrt` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n What type of argument does the expression expect? (Numbers? Strings? Booleans?) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Numbers.}}

@n What type of output does `sqrt` produce? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Number.}}

@n What did the expression evaluate to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4}}

@vspace{1ex}

`sqrt(x)`

@n Enter `sqrt(Weight)`. What do you observe? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's weight_}}

@n How about `sqrt(Legs)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's legs for `sqrt(Legs)`._}}

What about `sqrt(Name)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP produces an error message because it cannot find the square root of a string, only a number._}}

@vspace{1ex}

`stringLength(x)`

@n How many arguments does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n What type of argument does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{String}}

@n What does the expression `stringLegnth("rainbow")` evaluate to? How come? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_7, which is how many letters are in the string "rainbow"_}}

@n What happens when you enter `stringLength(Name)` @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_7, CODAP finds the amount of letters in each animal's `Name` _}}

@n Does `stringLength` produce a Number? String? Boolean? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Number}}
