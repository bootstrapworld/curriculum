To help you with this page, we've re-printed the Contract for the `text` function, and an example of how to use it. 

(Don't forget, you can always refer to the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Pages}. @pathway-only{_If you're working with a printed workbook, they are included in the back._})

@vspace{2ex}

@show{(contract 'text '((message String) (size Number) (color String)) "Image")}

@show{(code '(text "hello" 24 "green"))}


@n On the three lines below, write the code to lookup the value of the `species` column from `dog-row`, `old-row`, and `young-row`.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`dog-row["species"]`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`old-row["species"]`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`young-row["species"]`}}


@n On the three lines below, write the code that uses the `text` function to show the species of those same three rows in __red, 15px letters__.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(dog-row["species"], 15, "red")`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(old-row["species"], 15, "red")`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(young-row["species"], 15, "red")`}}

@n When you are confident with the code you have written, check with your partner or another student. Do you have the same code? Why or why not?
