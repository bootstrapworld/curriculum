@n On the three lines below, write the code to lookup the value of the `age` column from `dog-row`, `old-row`, and `young-row`.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`dog-row["age"]`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`old-row["age"]`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`young-row["age"]`}}


@n On the three lines below, write the code that uses the `circle` function to draw a solid, blue circle whose radius is the _age of the animal_. HINT: you may need to look up the contract for `circle` in your Contracts page!

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`circle(dog-row["age"], "solid", "blue")`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`circle(old-row["age"], "solid", "blue")`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`circle(young-row["age"], "solid", "blue")`}}

@n When you are confident with the code you have written, check with your partner or another student. Do you have the same code? Why or why not?

_Instead of writing this out over and over for each animal, let's define a function to do it for us!_
