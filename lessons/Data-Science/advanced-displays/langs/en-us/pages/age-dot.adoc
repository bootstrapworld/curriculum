@n Write the code to lookup the value of the `age` column for each of the rows listed.

@n Write the code that uses the `circle` function to draw a solid, blue circle whose radius is the _age of the animal_ for each of the rows listed.

_Instead of writing repetitive code like this out over and over for each animal, let's define a function to do it for us!_
