= Exploring Conditional / Piecewise Functions

Here's an example of a piecewise function with 3 "pieces" (or "conditions"):
```
# species-dot :: (Row) -> Image
fun species-dot(r):
  if      (r["species"] == "dog"):       square(5, "solid", "black")
  else if (r["species"] == "cat"):       square(5, "solid", "orange")
  else if (r["species"] == "lizard"):    square(5, "solid", "green")
  end
end
```

@n What will this function produce for a dog? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a solid, 5px, black circle}}

@n What will this function produce for a cat? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a solid, 5px, orange circle}}

**Open the @starter-file{piecewise-displays}, and click "Run".**

@n Compare the regular scatter plot with the image scatter plot. What can you see now that you couldn't see before?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Weight is VERY skewed based on species. The dogs are overwhelmingly the heaviest!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Compare the regular histogram with the image histogram. What can you see now that you couldn't see before?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Many of the animals weighing between 0 and 10 pounds are cats. }}

@fitb{}{}

@n On line 46, add a comment (#) to "turn off" the condition for snails. What do you think will happen when you click Run? Try it out!

@n In your own words, describe how piecewise / conditional functions work.

@star OPTIONAL: Make a **new function** (don't delete `species-dot`!), which uses piecewise functions to draw something different! For example, have it draw different shapes depending on whether an animal is younger than 3 years old or not.
