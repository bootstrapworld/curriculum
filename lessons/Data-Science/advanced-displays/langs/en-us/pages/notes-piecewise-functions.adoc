== Functions as Data

You've learned that functions are __machines that consume and produce data__, and by now you've learned plenty of data types (e.g. - Numbers, Strings, Images, Booleans, Rows and Tables). In the real world, we see machines do this sort of thing all the time: bulbs that consume electricity and produce light, or consume bread and produce toast.

But sometimes, **machines even consume other machines:**

- A blender or kitchen mixer might have different attachments. Each attachment is a machine of its own!
- You might swap out the stereo from your car for a new one with more features. Each stereo is a machine!

This is true of function machines in math and programming, as well! Functions can be their own kind of data type!

Imagine a function `species-dot`, that consumes a Row from the Animals Dataset, and produces a different-colored square depending on the species. What if, instead of drawing the same blue dot for each animal in a scatter plot, we used `species-dot` to customize the color for each row? In this example, we're using the `species-dot` function __as an input to our scatter plot function!__

Printed below is the contract for a special scatter plot function, which __consumes functions__. In fact, there are special functions for other kinds of displays as well:

@show{(contracts
  '("image-scatter-plot" ("Table" "String" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-histogram" ("Table" "String" "Number" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-bar-chart" ("Table" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-pie-chart" ("Table" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
)}

Look carefully at the last argument in each Domain. In each case, it's a function that **consumes a Row and produces an Image**.

== Piecewise Functions

- Functions always appy a particular rule to their input. In an earlier lesson, you saw how `gt` always draws a solid, green triangle using the input as the size.
- But in `species-dot` example above, there's no single rule that will generate a different color for each species. We need a way for functions to change rules, depending on their input.

- In math, *Piecewise Functions* are functions that can behave one way for part of their Domain, and another way for a different part. In our `species-dot` example, our function might draw black squares when the input is a dog, but orange squares when the input is a cat.

- Piecewise functions are divided into "pieces". Each piece is divided into two parts:

. How the function should behave
. The domain where it behaves that way

- Each "piece" of our piecewise function has two parts: the "if" and the "then". This tells the computer _when_ to apply each rule, and _what_ the rule is.

```
# species-dot :: (Row) -> Image
fun species-dot(r):
  if      (r["species"] == "dog"):       square(5, "solid", "black")
  else if (r["species"] == "cat"):       square(5, "solid", "orange")
  else if (r["species"] == "rabbit"):    square(5, "solid", "pink")
  else if (r["species"] == "tarantula"): square(5, "solid", "red")
  else if (r["species"] == "lizard"):    square(5, "solid", "green")
  end
end
```
