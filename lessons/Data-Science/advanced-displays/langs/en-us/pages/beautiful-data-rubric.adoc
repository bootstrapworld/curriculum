| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| Get Inspired
| I found a terrific visualization and included it, along with a link to where I found it. I gave detailed reasons why it matters to me and what I like about it. I included clear reasons why the artistic quality of the visualization adds to its appeal and usefulness.
| I found a visualization that I liked and included it, along with a link to where I found it. I came up at least one reason why it matters and what I like. I wrote something about how the creativity in the visualization adds to it.
| I found a visualization, and either forgot to include a link or didn't say much about why I liked it or why it's creative.

| Find Your Data
| I found data and made a display that is interesting to me, and included a link to the dataset and the code used to generate a display. I wrote detailed reasons about why my data and visualization matter.
| I found data and made a display that is interesting to me, and included a link to the dataset and the code used to generate a display. I wrote something about why the data and/or the display are interesting.
| I found data and made a display, but did not include a link to the data, the code used for the display, or a description of why they are interesting.

| What Data is Missing?
| I thought of at least two columns in my dataset that would be really important to consider, in addition to the displays I made earlier. For each of those columns, I wrote a clear observation and question about how those columns might influence the displays.
| I thought of at least two columns in my dataset that matter, but had trouble explaining what my observation was or what the question about those columns might be.
| I could not think of two columns that mattered, so I picked them at random. I could not explain what the observation or questions would be.

| Make it Beautiful
| I included my custom display and the code used to make it. My customized display uses color, shapes, and/or images that are relevant to the topic, visually appealing, and makes the data easier to understand. My writing clearly communicates all of this.
| I included my custom display and the code used to make it. My customized display uses color, shapes, and/or images that are relevant to the topic. I adequately describe what my code does.
| I included my custom display, but I am missing the code used to make it, a description of what I did, or my customization isn't really relevant to the topic.
