== Composing Table Operations

=== Overview
Students learn to diagram expressions using the Circles of Evaluation. This tool has deep roots in both @lesson-link{order-of-operations} and @lesson-link{function-composition}, and math teachers may want to take a detour through one or both of these lessons to support those learning goals.

=== Launch
By now, you're familiar with a number of table operations: visualizing (as a bar chart, histogram, etc.), filtering, sorting, and building - but what if we want to perform _multiple operations?_ Visualizing, Sorting, Filtering and Building are powerful operations, but when they are _combined_ they become even more powerful!

@slidebreak

A journalist comes to the shelter who wants to write a story about a successful pet adoption -- but she has a very specific set of criteria. The reporter wants to report on the adoption of an animal that weighs *more than 9 kilograms* (they don't use "pounds" in Britain!).

@QandA{
@Q{To provide her with this data, what operations do we need to do to our dataset?}
@A{We need to filter, showing only rows that are greater than 9kg. We also need to add a column that shows weight in kilograms, dividing pounds by 2.2.}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{
Order matters: Build, Filter, Sort.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What do you think will happen if we try to filter animals that weigh more than 9kg, before actually building a `"kilos"` column?}
@A{(Sample responses:) It will crash! The computer won't like it!}
}

@slidebreak

If we use our functions in the wrong order (trying to filter by a column that doesnâ€™t exist yet), we might wind up crashing the program. But even worse, the program might run but produce nonsensical results! We need a way to think about our table operations that lets us plan out what we want to do. Fortunately, you already know a tool that does exactly this: the @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}!

*_1) Every Circle must have one - and only one! - function, written at the top._*

*_2) The arguments of the function are written left-to-right, in the middle of the Circle._*

@slidebreak

Values like Numbers, String, and Booleans are still written by themselves. It's only when we want to _use a function_ that we need to draw a Circle, and write the values inside from left-to-right.

Let's try diagramming what we need to do for the journalist, using the Circles of Evaluation. We always build first, so let's start there. According to the @vocab{Contract}, we know the name of the function is `build-column`, and it needs three arguments: the animals table, the name of the new column `"kilos"`, and the `kilograms` function.

@show{(coe '(build-column animals-table "kilos" kilograms))}

@slidebreak

But we also need to filter by that new column, so that we only have animals weighing more than 9kg! That means we need _another_ Circle of Evaluation. We know `filter` goes at the top. But what table are we using for the first argument? It can't be the animals-table again, because that doesn't have a `"kilos"` column.

*_3) Circles can contain other Circles!_*

Our first Circle of Evaluation _produces a table_, and that's the one we want to use as the first input to `filter`!

@show{(coe '(filter (build-column animals-table "kilos" kilograms) is-heavy))}

@slidebreak

To convert a Circle of Evaluation into code, *we start at the outside and work our way in*. After each function we write a pair of parentheses, and then convert each argument inside the Circle. The code for this Circle of Evaluation would be @show{(code '(box-plot (filter (filter animals-table is-dog) is-young) "age"))}.

@lesson-instruction{
- Type this into Pyret and see what you get!
- Now draw the Circle of Evaluation showing how to make a _bar chart_ showing the species in the shelter, _but only for old animals_. Then convert it to code and type it into Pyret.

@strategy{Teaching Tip}{


Use different color markers to draw the Circles of Evaluation, and then use those same colors when writing the code. This helps make the connection between Circles and code clearer.

=== Synthesize

Was it helpful to think about the Circles, without worrying about @proglang? Why or why not?
