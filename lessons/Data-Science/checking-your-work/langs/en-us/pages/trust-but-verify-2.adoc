This page requires that you also open the @starter-file{trust-but-verify}.
}

A “helpful” Data Scientist gives you access to the following function:

@vspace{1ex}

@show{(contract
  "old-dogs-nametags" '("Table") "Table"
  "consumes a table of animals, and produces a table containing only dogs 5 years or older, with an extra column showing their name in red"
)}

@vspace{1ex}

You can use the function, _but you can’t see the code for it!_ *How do you know if you
can trust their code?*

@n What qualities would a verification subset need to have?

@fitb{}{
  @ifsoln{At least one of each species, to make sure non-dogs are filtered out}
}

@fitb{}{
  @ifsoln{Animals -- especially dogs -- whose ages are both ≥ and < than 5}
}

@fitb{}{
  @ifsoln{At least two old dogs with different names}
}

@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Create your verification subset! In the space below, list the name of each animal in your subset.
