== Confirming Analysis

=== Overview
Students learn how to create a @vocab{Testing Table}, which is small enough to reason about and can be used to test whether code does the right thing.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}
One of the main purposes of Data Science is to take a representative sample from a larger population, and use information from the sample to infer what’s true about the whole population.

Data scientists usually think in terms of samples that best serve the purpose of _performing inference_. +
Samples should be:

- representative of the entire population
- large enough to get us fairly close to the truth about that population.

@slidebreak{Launch}

Consider these scenarios:

- Uber and Google are making self-driving cars, which use artificial intelligence to interpret sensor data and make decisions about whether a car should speed up, slow down, or slam on the brakes. This AI is trained on a lot of sample data, which it learns from. 
  * What might be the problem if the sample data only included roads in California?
- A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug
  * Why might it be a bad thing to only test medicines on men* (or only on women), before prescribing them to the general public?

@slidebreak{Launch}

Samples are taken in Data Science and Computer Programming for different reasons. 

@slidebreak{Launch}

You've already written lots of code to analyze data. 

Millions of lines of code just like yours are run on datasets every day. The results are used to tell us:

- whether a drug is safe or not
- whether someone should be put on the "no-fly" list
- how much someone needs to pay for health insurance 
and more. 

@lesson-point{
But programmers are only human, and everyone makes mistakes! 
}

With so-called "A.I. Code Generators" out there writing more and more code for us, we need better and better ways of _verifying_ that code does exactly what it claims to do!

How can we trust that our code is correct?

@slidebreak{Launch}

Programmers need to think in terms of @vocab{Testing Tables} that best serve the purpose of verifying that their code does what it’s supposed to: The Tables should be designed to call attention to any imperfections in the code’s instructions.

@lesson-point{
A good @vocab{Testing Table} should be _representative_ of the population, and _relevant_ to what’s being analyzed. }

@slidebreak{Launch}

A good @vocab{Testing Table} should have...

- _At least_ the columns that matter -- whether we’ll be ordering or filtering by those columns.
- Enough rows to include different circumstances that are relevant to the task at hand. For instance, if our code is supposed to extract certain cats from the animals table, our Testing Table should include at least one animal that’s not a cat.
- Rows that aren’t already sorted, if our analysis is supposed to sort for us.

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
Consider the following scenario: +
An AI writes code that claims to filter out any shelter data to show only the cats.
@Q{Could we test it using a Table that _already_ contains only cats?}
@A{No! The AI's code might do nothing at all and just return the Table it was given. It would give _the right answer for the wrong reason_! We need to find out if it actually removes non-cat Rows.}
@Q{Could we test it using a Table that has no cats at all?}
@A{No! The AI's code might always return a table with no rows (regardless of species!), so giving it a Table without cats will give _the right answer for the wrong reason_! We need to find out if it actually keeps rows for cats.}
@Q{Could we test it using a Table that has only cats and dogs?}
@A{No! Maybe the AI's code just removes dogs. We need to see if it removes other species as well.}
}

Verifying that code does what it is designed to do is an important part of checking our work! That's why writing examples is so valuable: it's a chance to think about how the program _should_ work, without worrying as much about _how_ it works.

@slidebreak{Investigate-DN}

@lesson-instruction{
An AI writes a function called `fixed-cats` and _claims_ that, given a table of animals, it produces a table with only fixed cats.

- Do you trust it? How could you test it?
- Which animals would you use in a Testing Table?
- Complete @printable-exercise{trust-but-verify.adoc}.
- Open the @starter-file{trust-but-verify}. There are 3 versions of `fixed-cats`. Are they all correct? If not, which ones are broken?
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
An AI writes a function called `old-dogs-nametags` and _claims_ that, given a table of animals, it produces a table with only dogs five years or older, with an extra column showing their names in red.

- Do you trust it? How could you test it?
- Which animals would you use in a Testing Table?
- Turn to @printable-exercise{trust-but-verify-2.adoc}. Using the same Starter File, construct a Testing Table and figure out which (if any) of the functions are correct!
}

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}
Complex analysis has more room for mistakes, so it’s critical to think about a Testing Table that allows us to trust that our code really does what it’s supposed to!

@QandA{
@Q{What should a good testing table include?}
@A{All of the columns that matter. (extras are fine.)}
@A{Enough rows to represent a range of different circumstances. e.g. not just one species.}
@A{Rows that aren’t already sorted, if our analysis is supposed to sort for us.
}

== When AI isn't Intelligent...

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

Law enforcement in many towns has started using facial-recognition software to automatically detect whether someone has a warrant out for their arrest. A lot of facial-recognition software, however, has been trained on sample data containing mostly white faces. Why might this be a problem?

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}
@teacher{Either engage students in reading "@printable-exercise{ai-article-register.pdf, Summarizing US Congress Testimony on Artificial Intelligence}" or watching this 10-minute video @link{https://www.YouTube.com/eRUEVYndh9c, The Coded Gaze: Bias in Artificial Intelligence}.}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete @printable-exercise{ai-reflection.adoc}
}

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

Discuss the article and/or video, revisiting the following questions:

@QandA{
@Q{What are some concerns that experts and activists have raised about Artificial Intelligence?}
@A{Facial recognition software has been trained on biased datasets, so its ability to recognize people is better for some subgroups of the population than it is for others.}
@A{Biased facial recognition software is being used by law enforcement and immigration agencies:
  * these agencies have power to do serious harm
  * the possible harm disproportionately impacts people with less power
  * in addition the software being trained on biased datasets, most data used by law enforcement is often grainy and low resolution
}

@Q{What are some solutions that would address these concerns?}
@A{Not use facial recognition for high stakes purposes that have the potential to mistakenly dramatically negatively impact someone's life, like law enforcement and immigration enforcement.}
@A{Regulate facial recognition software and check for biased algorithms.}
@A{Improve training for people making decisions using facial recognition software.}

@Q{How would you test whether or not a facial recognition system was equally accurate for everyone?}
@A{We would need a testing dataset representative of the diversity of the population including people of different ages with different skin colors, head shapes, facial structures, weights, hair types/colors/styles, facial hair, makeup usage, etc. who were and weren't supposed to be identified by the system.
