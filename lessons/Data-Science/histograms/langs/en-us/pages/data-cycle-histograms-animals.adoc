Use the Data Cycle to explore the distribution of one or more quantitative columns in @starter-file{animals} using *histograms*, and write down your findings.

| The histogram I created is for @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{age}}{x-variable in context} from @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{the animals dataset}}{dataset or subset}.

The bin size I chose is @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{3}}{bin size}, which resulted in a histogram with @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{10}}{how many?} bins. I chose this bin size because @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a bin size of 5 did not capture the shape completely}}

I would describe the shape of this histogram as @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers vary. More data on the left, then it trails out to the right.}}

I notice that @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{Answers vary. Felix is an outlier.}}{Consider statements like:  Most of the histogram's area is... / A small amount of the histograms area trails out... / etc}

I wonder @fitb{}{@ifsoln{why there are so many 2-3 year old animals. Answers vary.}}
