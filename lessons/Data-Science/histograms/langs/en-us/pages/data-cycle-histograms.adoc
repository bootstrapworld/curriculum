Use the Data Cycle to explore the distribution of one or more quantitative columns using *histograms*, and write down your findings.

| The histogram I created is for @fitbruby{16em}{}{x-variable in context} from @fitbruby{16em}{}{dataset or subset}.

The bin size I chose is @fitbruby{5em}{}{bin size}, which resulted in a histogram with @fitbruby{5em}{}{how many?} bins. I chose this bin size because @fitb{}{}

I would describe the shape of this histogram as @fitb{}{}

I notice that @fitbruby{}{}{Consider statements like:  Most of the histogram's area is... / A small amount of the histograms area trails out... / etc}

I wonder @fitb{}{}
