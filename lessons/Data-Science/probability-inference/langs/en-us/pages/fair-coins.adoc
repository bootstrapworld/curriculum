@link-instructions{
Open the @starter-file{fair-coins}, which defines `coin1`, `coin2`, and `coin3`. Click "Run". +
You can flip each coin by evaluating `flip(coin1)` in the Interactions Area (repeat for coins 2 and 3). 
}

_One of these coins is fair, one will land on "heads" 75% of the time, and one will land on "heads" 90% of the time. *Which one is which?*_

@teacher{Answers are not provided because they will be different for each student!}
@n Complete the table below by recording the results for five flips of each coin and _totaling_ the number of "heads" you saw. +
Convert the ratio of heads to flips into a _percentage_. Finally, decide whether or not you think each coin is _fair_ based on your sample.

@n Record 15 more flips of each coin in the table below and _total_ the number of "heads" you saw _in all 20 flips of each coin_. +
Convert the ratio of total heads to total flips into a _percentage_. Finally, decide whether you think each coin is fair based on this larger sample.

@n Why was that coin the easiest to identify? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The more the outcome matches the null hypothesis, the larger the sample you'll need to detect it.}}
