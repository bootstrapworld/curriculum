Open the @starter-file{fair-coins}, which defines `coin1`, `coin2`, and `coin3`. Click "Run". You can flip each coin by evaluating `flip(coin1)` in the Interactions Area (repeat for coins 2 and 3). __One of these coins is fair, one will land on "heads" 75% of the time, and one will land on "heads" 90% of the time. **Which one is which?**__

@n In the table below, record five flips of each coin and the number of "heads" you saw. Then convert that number into a _percentage_. Finally, write a "Y" or "N" depending on whether you think each coin is fair based on your sample.

@n In the table below, record 15 more flips of each coin and the number of "heads" you saw. Then convert that number into a _percentage_. Finally, write a "Y" or "N" depending on whether you think each coin is fair based on your sample.

@n Which weighted coin did you identify first: fair, 75%, or 90%? @fitb{}{}

@n Why was that coin the easiest to find? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The more the outcome matches the null hypothesis, the larger the sample you'll need to detect it.}}
