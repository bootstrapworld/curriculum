@n In the screenshots of the “Sampler” (below), show how you would create a small random sample of 10 animals and a large random sample of 40 animals. _To create two separate tables (rather than a single hierarchical table), re-select and re-open “Sampler” from the Plugins menu before each sampling simulation._

@n In the options tab, did you select “with replacement” or “without replacement”? Why?

@n Make a bar chart for the animals in each sample, showing percentages of fixed and unfixed.

- The percentage of fixed animals in the entire population is: @fitb{}{*47.7%*}
- The percentage of fixed animals in the small sample is: @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of fixed animals in the large sample is: @fitb{}{}

@n Make a bar chart for the animals in each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is: @fitb{}{*roughly 5%*}
- The percentage of tarantulas in the small sample is: @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of tarantulas in the large sample is: @fitb{}{}

@n Direct the sampler to generate a different set of random samples of these sizes. Make a new bar chart for each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is: @fitb{}{*roughly 5%*}
- The percentage of tarantulas in the small sample is: @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of tarantulas in the large sample is: @fitb{}{}

@n Which repeated sample gave us a more accurate inference about the whole population? Why?
