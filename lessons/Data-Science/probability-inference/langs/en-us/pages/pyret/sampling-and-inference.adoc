@n Evaluate the `more-animals` table in the Interactions Area. This is the _complete_ population of animals from the shelter!

@vspace{1ex}

Here is a true statement about that population: _The population is 47.7% fixed and 52.3% unfixed._

@vspace{1ex}

*Type each of the following lines into the Interactions Area and hit “Enter".*
----
random-rows(more-animals, 10)
random-rows(more-animals, 40)
----
@n What do you get?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a table of 10 or 40 random rows (respectively) from the `more-animals` table}}

@n What is the Contract for `random-rows`?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`# random-rows :: Table, Number -> Table`}}


@n What does the `random-rows` function do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It produces a table of a specified amount of random rows, drawn from a specified table.}}

@n In the Definitions Area, 

- define `small-sample` to be `random-rows(more-animals, 10)`  
- define `large-sample` to be `random-rows(more-animals, 40)`

@vspace{1ex}

@n Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing percentages of fixed and unfixed.

- The percentage of fixed animals in the entire population is @fitb{}{*47.2%*}
- The percentage of fixed animals in `small-sample` is @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of fixed animals in `large-sample` is @fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is @fitb{}{*roughly 5%*}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `large-sample` is @fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}
 
@n Click "Run" to direct the computer to generate a different set of random samples of these sizes. Make a new `pie-chart` for each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is @fitb{}{*roughly 4.9%*}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is @fitb{}{}
- The percentage of tarantulas in `large-sample` is @fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Which sample size gave us a more accurate inference about the whole population? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{presumably `large-sample`}}
