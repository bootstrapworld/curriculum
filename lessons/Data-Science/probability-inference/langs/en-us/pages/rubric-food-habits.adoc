| I filled in the Google form each and every time I had a snack. If I was unable to complete the form at the time of the snack, I made a point of completing it as soon as possible. When I responded to the prompts, I gave accurate information (acquired by looking at the nutritional label). This snacking log perfectly accurately represents my snacking.
| I filled in the Google form almost every time I had a snack. When I responded to the prompts, I tried my best to give accurate information, but sometimes I made guesses about  the number of servings, calories per serving, etc. Overall, the accuracy of the data collected is decent, however.
| I often forgot to fill in the Google form when I snacked. I had to go back and dig through my memories to make educated guesses about my snacking habits. The information recorded during the data collection phase is most likely not an accurate depiction of my snacking habits.

| The text describing America’s snacking habits (and how they differ from my own) would benefit from additional detail. It is not clear to the viewer that I have thoughtfully analyzed the data presented. My writing is sometimes evidence-based, but sometimes not.
| My written descriptions are confusing, leaving the viewer asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.

| My statistical question and its answer (slideshow and writing)
| I developed a compelling and interesting statistical question based on the data I collected. I clearly answered that question by presenting plots, tables, photos and thoughtful written analysis.
| The statistical question I chose is not fully answered by the data presented. I have put in some effort to answer the question with plots, tables, photos and written analysis, but more detail is needed.
| My statistical question is simple and straightforward, and answering it did not require much critical analysis by me /// My statistical question was not adequately answered by my graphics and written analysis.


| Discussion of challenges (writing)
