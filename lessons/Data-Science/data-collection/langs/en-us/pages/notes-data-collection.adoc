Politicians pass laws, shoppers choose brands, and countries go to war based on studies that sounds reliable. But is everything that _seems_ reliable actually reliable? *Can we really trust these studies?*

There are many ways for a study to be flawed. Some flaws sneak in by accident, and data scientists have an obligation to look for these flaws and minimize them.

- A survey of people's favorite restaurants will be flawed, if it's only given to vegetarians.
- Some people might not fill out a survey that requires them to share their religion. This might change the results of the survey!
- A survey that lets people write whatever they want for "sex" might get some answers that are left blank, misspelled, or answers that aren't really about sex. Removing these responses from the dataset might change the results of the survey - especially if a certain group is more likely to leave it blank.

Being an ethical data scientist means making sure that every element of your study is designed to minimize bias in the data and the analysis.
