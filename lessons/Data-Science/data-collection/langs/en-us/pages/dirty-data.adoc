A bunch of new animals are coming to the shelter, and that means more data! Open the @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wLPE6i4P7TMWxpcOnOHGMWBNYopwHf7GpdZMnbgosqA/edit?usp=sharing, New Animals Dataset} and take a _careful_ look.

There are many different ways that data can be dirty!

. *Missing Data* - A column containing some cells with data, but some cells left blank.

. *Inconsistent Types* - A column with inconsistent data types. For example, a `years` column where almost every cell is a Number, but one cell contains the string `"5 years old"`.

. *Inconsistent Units* - A column with consistent data types, but inconsistent units. For example, a `weight` column where some entries are in pounds but others are in kilograms.

. *Inconsistent Naming* - Inconsistent spelling and capitalization for entries lead to them being counted as different. For example, a `species` column where some entries are `"cat"` and others are `"Cat"` will not give us a full picture of the cats.

@n Which animals' row(s) have *missing data*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Mona, Rover, Susie Q, and Happy}}

@n Which column(s) have *inconsistent types*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Fixed (Booleans and Strings) and Weight (Numbers and Strings)}}

@n Which column(s) have *inconsistent units*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Weight (KG and LBS) and Time to Adoption (The numbers can't possibly all mean "years")}}

@n Which column(s) have *inconsistent naming*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Species (singular and...plural), Gender (lowercase and capitalized)}}

@n If we want to analyze this data, what should we do with the rows for Tanner, Toni, and Lizzy?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Change "YES" to TRUE and "No" to FALSE in the Fixed column}}

@n If we want to analyze this data, what should we do with the rows for Chanel and Bibbles?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Convert all weights to pounds, expressed only in Numbers}}

@n If we want to analyze this data, what should we do with the rows for Porche and Boss?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We don't know what units their time-to-adoption are, there is no definite answer here.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students might suggest removing the rows, or trying to fix those units somehow.}}

@n If we want to analyze this data, what should we do with the row for Niko?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We don't know what species Niko is, or whether there are three Nikos, there is no definite answer here.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students might suggest removing this row.}}

@n If we want to analyze this data, what should we do with rows for Mona, Rover, Susie Q, and Happy?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We don't know what their weights are, so there is no definite answer here.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students might suggest removing these rows.}}

@n Sometimes data cleaning is straightforward. Sometimes the problem is evident but the solution is less certain. For which questions were you certain of your data cleaning suggestion? For which were you less certain? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Questions 5 and 6 can be corrected, but the others cannot.}}
