@n Paolo made a `pie-chart` of the `dessert` column and was suprised to discover that *Fruit* was the most popular dessert among 8th graders! Make the `pie-chart`. Why is this pie-chart misleading? How is the data "dirty"?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Chocolate and Ice Cream are more popular, but with so many different spelling and capitalization differences}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{they show up as many, less-popular different desserts}}

@n What ideas do you have for how the survey designer could have made sure that the data in the `dessert` column would have been cleaner?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Fix the spreadsheet so every spelling of each dessert is the same}}

@n Shani made a `bar-chart` of the `gender-id` column. In her analysis she stated that the most common gender identity among eighth graders in her class is male. Make the `pie-chart`. Do you agree? Why or Why Not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Same issue as the "dessert" column - too many variations in spelling and capitalization}}

@n Make a chart showing the ages of the 8th graders surveyed. What "dirty" data problems do you spot and how are they misleading?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{One 8th grader is 41 years old - that can't be right!}}
