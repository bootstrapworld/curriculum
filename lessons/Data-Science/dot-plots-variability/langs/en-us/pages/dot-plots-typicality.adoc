== Reading a Dot Plot

@n What is the difference (in letters) between the longest name and the shortest name? @fitb{5em}{}

@n What is the most common name length? @fitb{}{}

@n What percentage of students have first names that are 5 letters long? @fitb{}{}



== Distribution

@n The *distribution* of the data is the way that it is spread out on the number line. One way to describe distribution is by identifying peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. Label any peaks, clusters, gaps, or outliers on the dot plot, below.

@n In as much detail as you can, describe the distribution of the name length data, discussing any peaks, clusters, gaps, and outliers. @fitb{}{}

== Typicality

@n Would 6 letters be a good description of the number of letters in students' names in this class? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}
