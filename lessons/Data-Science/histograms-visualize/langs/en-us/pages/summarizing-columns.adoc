The two data visualizations below both summarize columns of this table. In some ways they are similar. In other ways they are quite different!

| @n What type of data is displayed? +
@vspace{1ex}
| @ifsoln{categorical}
| @ifsoln{quantitative}

| @n Could we rearrange the order of the bars? +
@vspace{2ex}
| @ifsoln{Yes! order doesn't matter for bar charts.}
| @ifsoln{No. They are showing us the range of the data from least to greatest.}

| @n Does having a sense that the bars are taller on the left than the right tell us anything about the dataset as a whole?
| @ifsoln{No. The bars of this bar chart each give us the count of a particular species and those species could be listed in any order.}
| @ifsoln{Yes. The shape of a dataset tells us an important story! In this case, there are more light animals than heavy animals in the sample.}
