= Sorting Histograms

With your partner, sort the histograms into two piles: approximately symmetrical and definitely not symmetrical. Then, follow the prompts and respond to the questions below.

== Symmetrical Histograms

_Put your asymmetrical cards aside (or back in their envelope)._

@n List out the letters of the histograms that were symmetrical: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A, B, G, I, K, L}}

@n Sort the symmetrical cards into two or three logical groups. _Hint: It may be useful to think about peaks, gaps, clusters, center, and spread!_ What do the cards in your first group have in common? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response: I grouped together all of the symmetrical histograms with *no* gaps}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ (cards A, B, and G). Note: Students may group their cards in any of the ways listed in question 4--or they may think of additional ways to }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{group the cards!}}

@n What do the cards in your second group have in common? (Describe your third group as well, if you have a third group.) @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response: I grouped together all of the symmetrical histograms with at least one gap (cards I, K, and L).}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Can you think of a different way of grouping these histograms? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response 1: There is no peak (card B); there 1 peak (cards A and L); there are 2 peaks, one at the max and one at the min (cards G, I, and K).}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response 2: The display is perfectly symmetrical (cards B, G, and K) versus roughly symmetrical (cards A, I, and L).}}

@fitb{}{Possible response 3: The spread is 90-160 (cards A, G, and I) versus another spread (cards B, K, and L).}

@n Describe how you can determine what's typical of a symmetrical histogram.  @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I look for the center.}}

== Asymmetrical Histograms

_Put the symmetrical histograms away, and take out the asymmetrical histograms._

@n List out the letters of the histograms that were asymmetrical: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{C, D, E, F, H, J}}


@n Sort the asymmetrical histograms into two or three logical groups. What do the cards in your first group have in common? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The peak is on the left-hand side of the display (cards C, F, and H). Note: Students may group their cards in any of the ways listed}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{in question 9--or they may think of additional ways to sort their cards.}}

@n What do the cards in your second group have in common? (Describe your third group as well, if you have a third group.) @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The peak is on the right-hand side of the display (cards D, E, and J).}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Can you think of a different way of grouping these histograms? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response 1: There is a gap (cards C and E) versus there is no gap (cards D, F, H, and J).}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible response 2: The displays starts at zero (cards D and E) versus the display starts at a value greater than zero (cards C, F, H, and J).}}

@n Describe how you can determine where the outliers are on an asymmetrical histogram. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The outliers are separated from most of the rest of the data by gaps in the display.}}
