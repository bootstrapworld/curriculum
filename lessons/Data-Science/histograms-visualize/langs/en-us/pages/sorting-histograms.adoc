= Sorting Histograms

With your partner, sort the histograms into two piles: approximately symmetrical and definitely not symmetrical. Then, follow the prompts and respond to the questions below.

== Symmetrical Histograms

_Put your asymmetrical cards aside (or back in their envelope)._

@n List out the letters of the histograms that were symmetrical: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A, B, G, I, K, M, O, P, Q}}

@n Sort the symmetrical cards into two or three logical groups. _Hint: It may be useful to think about peaks, gaps, clusters, center, and spread!_ What do the cards in your first group have in common? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do the cards in your second group have in common? (Describe your third group as well, if you have a third group.) @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Can you think of a different way of grouping these histograms? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Describe how you can determine what's typical of a symmetrical histogram.  @fitb{}{}

== Asymmetrical Histograms

_Put the symmetrical histograms away, and take out the asymmetrical histograms._

@n List out the letters of the histograms that were asymmetrical: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{C, D, E, F, H, J, L, N, K}}


@n Sort the asymmetrical histograms into two or three logical groups. What do the cards in your first group have in common? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do the cards in your second group have in common? (Describe your third group as well, if you have a third group.) @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Can you think of a different way of grouping these histograms? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Describe how you can determine where the outliers are on an asymmetrical histogram. @fitb{}{}
