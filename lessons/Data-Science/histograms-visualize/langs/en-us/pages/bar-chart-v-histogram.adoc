= Bar Charts Versus Histograms



A university consists of six colleges. Each student in the university has chosen to enroll in one of these colleges. The *bar chart* below shows the distribution of college choice.

== Differences and Similarities

Respond to the prompts to complete the table below. If it helps you to look at a histogram as you complete the table, you can refer to @printable-exercise{making-histograms.adoc}.

| | Bar Chart  | Histogram
| Displays frequency: yes or no? | @ifsoln{yes} | @ifsoln{yes}
| Type of data: categorical or quantitative? | @ifsoln{categorical}| @ifsoln{quantitative}
| Bars touch: yes or no? | @ifsoln{no} | @ifsoln{yes}
| Bars can be reordered: yes or no? | @ifsoln{yes} | @ifsoln{no}
| The shape of the data matters: yes or no? | @ifsoln{no} | @ifsoln{yes}

@n What are some of the ways that bar charts and histograms are *alike*? _Summarize your conclusions from the table._ @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both display frequency. Both show bars.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Bar charts display categorical data, while histograms display quantitative data. A histogram's bars touch, and a bar chart's bars do not.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Histograms have shape, so their bars cannot be reordered. Bar chart bars can be reordered.}}



== Distribution of College Choice
@vspace{1ex}

Four different students share their conclusions about the display above. Only *one* of those conclusions is correct. Respond whether you agree or not, and then explain your stance.

Student A: "The distribution is skewed to the left." @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This is incorrect. There cannot be a skew because the display is a bar chart,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{which shows categorical data.}}


Student B: "The distribution is skewed to the right." @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This is incorrect. There cannot be a skew because the display is a bar chart, }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{which shows categorical data.}}

Student C: "The majority of students are enrolled in the college of science." @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This is incorrect. The tallest bar does not}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{necessarily represent the majority. In this case, fewer than half of students are in the college of science.}}


Student D: "After science and education, there is a large drop in enrollments for the other colleges." @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{This is correct. Science and education have far more enrollments than the other colleges. }}
