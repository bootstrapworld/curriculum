| Question  | Dot Plot 	| Histogram

| @n How many animals were in the shelter for fewer than 10 weeks? | @ifsoln{29} | @ifsoln{29}
| @n How many animals were in the shelter for exactly 30 weeks? | @ifsoln{1} | @ifsoln{x}
| @n What is the longest amount of time that an animal stayed in the shelter? | @ifsoln{30 weeks}| @ifsoln{x}
| @n How many animals were in the shelter for at least 5 weeks but not more than 25? | @ifsoln{x} | @ifsoln{13}
| @n Are there any gaps in the data? | @ifsoln{10-22} | @ifsoln{15-20, 25-30}
| @n Are there any peaks in the data? | @ifsoln{at 5} | @ifsoln{from 0-5}

@n When you answered the questions using the dot *plot*:

... Which questions were *easy* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{b, c, e}}
... Which questions were *hard* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a}}
... Which questions were *impossible* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{d}}

@n When you answered the questions using the *histogram*:

... Which questions were *easy* to answer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a, d}}

@n When might a histogram be more useful than a dot plot?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A histogram would be more useful for a very large dataset,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{where you want to identify trends rather than look at}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{individual data points.}}
