= Choosing the Right Bin Size

[.linkInstructions]
Open your saved @starter-file{animals}, or make a new copy@ifproglang{pyret}{, and click "Run".}@ifproglang{codap}{. After dragging an attribute to an axes, select Group into Bins from the Configuration menu. Fuse dots into bars, then enter the desired bin width.}

Make a histogram for the "weeks" column in the animals-table, using a bin size of 10 and the "name" column for your labels.

@n How many animals took between 0 and 10 weeks to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{29}}

@n How many animals took between 10 and 20 weeks to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1}}

@vspace{1ex}

Try some other bin sizes (be sure to experiment with bigger and smaller bins!)

@n What shape emerges? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{right skew}}

@n What bin size gives you a picture of the distribution with between 5 and 10 bins. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{5}}

@indented{@teacher{Be Prepared - Due to a bug in Google Charts, if students use a bin size of 5, 6, or 7, the histogram they get back will use a bin size of 5.}}

@n Are there any outliers? If so, are they high or low? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{high}}

@n How many animals took between 0 and 5 weeks to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{18}}

@n How many animals took between 5 and 10 weeks to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{11}}

@n What else do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Students will likely notice that a bin size of 3 gets rounded down to 2 and a bin size of 4 gets rounded down to 2.5}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{This rounding is inherited from a known bug google charts.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see most of the histogram’s area under the two bars between 0 and 10 weeks, so we can say it was most common for}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see a small amount of the histogram’s area trailing out to unusually high values, so we can say that a couple of animals}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{More than half of the animals (17 out of 31) took just 5 weeks or less to be adopted. But the few unusually long adoption times}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{pulled the average up to 5.8 weeks.}}

@n What was a typical time to adoption?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Almost all of the animals were adopted in 10 weeks or less,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{but a couple of animals took an unusually long time to be adopted -- even more than 20 or 30 weeks!}}
