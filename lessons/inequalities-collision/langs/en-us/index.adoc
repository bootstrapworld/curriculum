| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Explain how the distance formula is related to the Pythagorean theorem.
* Write a function for the distance formula.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain how the distance formula is connected to the Pythagorean theorem.
* I can write a function that takes in 2 points and returns the distance between them.

| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The distance formula is an excellent review of @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}. Have students work out the expression in small groups to foster discussion.

== Problem Decomposition Returns! @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students revisit the problem decomposition concept from @link{../problem-decomposition, earlier} @link{../inequalities2-compound, lessons}.

=== Launch
Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }
on their computer.

Problem Decomposition is a powerful tool, which lets us break apart complex problems into simpler ones that we can solve, test, and then glue together into a complex solution. 

Students may remember that there are two strategies for doing this:

. *Top-Down:* Describe the problem at a high level, then fill in the details later
. *Bottom-Up:* Focus on the smaller parts that you're sure of, then build them together to get the big picture

Problem Decomposition is the focus of @link{../problem-decomposition, an entire Bootstrap lesson}, is used to solve @link{../inequalities3-sam, `onscreen?`}, and build up the 2-dimensional @link{../distance-formula/, distance function}.

=== Investigate
For the following complex word problem, have students *first* decide which strategy they want to use, and then apply the Design Recipe to build the functions they need.

[.lesson-instruction]
A retractable flag pole starts out 24 inches tall, and can grow at a rate of 0.6in/sec. An elastic is tied to the top of the pole and anchored 200 inches from the base, forming a right triangle. Define functions that compute the height of the pole and the area of the triangle after a given number of seconds.

Have students complete the @printable-exercise{pages/top-down-bottom-up.adoc} worksheet, using Problem Decomposition and the Design Recipe to solve this problem!

=== Synthesize
- Which strategy did students use?
- Did they start out with one, and then switch to another?

== Collision Detection @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students once again see function composition at work, as they compose a simple inequality with the `distance` function they've created.

=== Launch
Knowing how far apart our characters are is the first step. We still need the computer to be asking: "True or False: is there a collision?"

=== Investigate
Using
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @printable-exercise{pages/collide.adoc}, }
@ifproglang{pyret}{ @printable-exercise{pages/collide.adoc}, }
have students write a function that takes in two coordinate pairs (four numbers) of the `PLAYER` and a character (`(px, py)` and `(cx, cy)`), and and returns `true` if they are within 50 @vocab{pixels} of each other.

=== Synthesize
- You started by writing the `distance` function first, and then `collide?` Is this *Top-Down* or *Bottom-Up* decomposition?
- Explicitly point out that this function is easy to write because we can _re-use_ the distance function. 
- Connect this back to `profit`, `revenue`, `cost` and `onscreen` from @link{../problem-decomposition, previous lessons}. Problem Decomposition is powerful!

== Additional Exercises:
- For teachers who've already introduced your class to flags, @ifproglang{pyret}{@opt-online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1HH39t2rTH2DIoClabJ17MSqkYS9uUChY&v=8c4da7d, the Flag of Trinidad and Tobago Starter Code}} 
@ifproglang{wescheme}{@opt-online-exercise{https://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=SQRHKcqQvW, the Flag of Trinidad and Tobago Starter Code}}
makes use of Pythagorean Theorem and could make for an interesting connection to this lesson.
