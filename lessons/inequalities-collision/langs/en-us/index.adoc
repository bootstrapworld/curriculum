== Problem Decomposition Returns! @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students revisit problem decomposition - the idea of breaking down a complex problem into simpler pieces, solving those pieces separately, and then composig the solutions to solve the original..

=== Launch

"Problem Decomposition" is a powerful tool, which lets us break apart complex problems into simpler ones that we can solve, test, and then glue together into a complex solution.

Students may remember that there are two strategies for doing this:

. *Top-Down:* Describe the problem at a high level, then fill in the details later
. *Bottom-Up:* Focus on the smaller parts that you're sure of, then build them together to get the big picture

=== Investigate
For the following complex word problem, have students *first* decide which strategy they want to use, and then apply the Design Recipe to build the functions they need.

[.lesson-instruction]
A retractable flag pole starts out 24 inches tall, and can grow at a rate of 0.6in/sec. An elastic is tied to the top of the pole and anchored 200 inches from the base, forming a right triangle. Define functions that compute the height of the pole and the area of the triangle after a given number of seconds.

Have students complete the @printable-exercise{pages/top-down-bottom-up.adoc} worksheet, using Problem Decomposition and the Design Recipe to solve this problem!

=== Synthesize
- Which strategy did students use?
- Did they start out with one, and then switch to another?

== Collision Detection @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students once again see function composition at work, as they compose a simple inequality with the `distance` function they've created.

=== Launch
Knowing how far apart our characters are is the first step. We still need the computer to be asking: "True or False: is there a collision?"

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
* Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/collision.adoc}
* Write a function that
** takes in two @vocab{coordinate pairs} representing the locations of
*** the `PLAYER` `(px, py)` and
*** a `CHARACTER` `(cx, cy)`
**** _Note: `CHARACTER` refers to a `DANGER` or a `TARGET` and the function will work for both._
** and returns `true` if the locations are within 50 @vocab{pixels} of each other.
* Then login to @starter-file{program-list}, fix the `is-collision` function in your game file, and click "Run"!

=== Synthesize
- You started by writing the `distance` function first, and then  @show{(code 'collision?)}. Is this *Top-Down* or *Bottom-Up* decomposition?
- Explicitly point out that this function is easy to write because we can _re-use_ the distance function.
- Connect this back to `profit`, `revenue`, `cost` and `onscreen` from @lesson-link{problem-decomposition, the Problem Decomposition lesson}.

== Additional Exercises:
For teachers who've already introduced your class to flags, @opt-starter-file{flags-trinidad} makes use of Pythagorean Theorem and could make for an interesting connection to this lesson.
