1. *For each row in the Sample Table on the left, add a point to the scatter plot on the right* .  Use the values from the age column for the x-axis, and values from the weeks column for the y-axis.

2. Do you see a pattern? Do the points seem to shift up or down as age increases?  *Draw a line on the scatter plot to show this pattern.*

3. Does the line slope upwards or downwards?

4. Are the points tightly clustered around the line? Loosely scattered?
