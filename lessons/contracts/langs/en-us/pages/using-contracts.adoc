Use the contracts to write expressions to generate images similar to those pictured.

@show{(code 'ellipse)}`{two-colons} Number, Number, String, String -> Image`

| @centered-image{../images/ellipse-50-150-outline.png, black outline of an ellipse that's about 3 times as tall as it is wide}
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(ellipse 50 150 "outline" "black")) }}

| @centered-image{../images/ellipse-150-50-solid.png, solid black ellipse that's about 3 times as wide as it is tall}
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(ellipse 150 50 "solid" "black")) }}

| What changes with the first number?
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{"_width_" }}

| What about the shape changes with the second Number?
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{"_height_" }}
| Write an expression using @show{(code 'ellipse)} to produce a circle.
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(ellipse 50 50 "solid" "black")) }}

@show{(code 'regular-polygon)}`{two-colons} Number, Number, String, String -> Image`

[cols="^.^1,^.^2",stripes="none"]

| @centered-image{../images/reg-polygon-50-5-solid.png, solid black pentagon}
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(regular-polygon 50 5 "solid" "black")) }}

| @centered-image{../images/reg-polygon-25-8-outline.png, black outline of an octagon}
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(regular-polygon 25 8 "outline" "black")) }}

| What changes with the first Number?
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{"_the length of each side_" }}

| What about the shape changes with the second Number?
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{"_the number of sides_" }}

| Use @show{(code 'regular-polygon)} to write an expression for a square!
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(regular-polygon 50 4 "solid" "black")) }}

| How would you describe a *regular polygon* to a friend?
| @fitb{}{@showsoln{"_a closed shape made of equal-length straight lines, all joined at the same angle_"  }}
