| @centered-image{../images/ellipse-50-150-outline.png, black outline of an ellipse that's about 3 times as tall as it is wide}
| Use the contract to write an expression that generates a similar image:

@showsoln{(code '(ellipse 50 150 "outline" "black")) }

| @centered-image{../images/ellipse-150-50-solid.png, solid black ellipse that's about 3 times as wide as it is tall}
| Use the contract to write an expression that generates a similar image:

@showsoln{(code '(ellipse 150 50 "solid" "black")) }

| What changes with the first Number?
| @showsoln{"_width_" }

| What about the shape changes with the second Number?
| @showsoln{"_height_" }

| Write an expression using @show{(code 'ellipse)} to produce a circle.
| @showsoln{(code '(ellipse 50 50 "solid" "black")) }

[cols="^.^1a,^.^2a",stripes="none"]
|===
| @centered-image{../images/reg-polygon-50-5-solid.png, solid black pentagon}
| Use the contract to write an expression that generates a similar image:

@showsoln{(code '(regular-polygon 50 5 "solid" "black")) }

| @centered-image{../images/reg-polygon-25-8-outline.png, black outline of an octagon}
| Use the contract to write an expression that generates a similar image:

@showsoln{(code '(regular-polygon 25 8 "outline" "black")) }

| What changes with the first Number?
| @showsoln{"_the length of each side_" }

| What about the shape changes with the second Number?
| @showsoln{"_the number of sides_" }

| Use @show{(code 'regular-polygon)} to write an expression for a square!
| @showsoln{(code '(regular-polygon 50 4 "solid" "black")) }

| How would you describe a *regular polygon* to a friend?
| @showsoln{"_a closed shape made of equal-length straight lines, all joined at the same angle_"  }
