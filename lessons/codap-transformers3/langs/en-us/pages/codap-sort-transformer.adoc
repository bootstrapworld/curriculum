@n We're going to create a Transformer that will sort the animals alphabetically by name. Select Sort from the drop-down menu.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Give your Transformer a descriptive name. Type it in.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Which dataset do you want CODAP to apply this Transformer to? Select it from the drop-down menu.

@vspace{1ex}

@n We're going to sort "By Attribute," which should already be selected from the "Sort Method" drop-down menu.

@n Which attribute should we sort by? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{name}}

@n Which direction will you select? Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"Ascending" sorts from A to Z, so I will select that.}}

@n Apply the Transformer. What happens? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A copy of the original dataset is created.}}

|===

@n You may have noticed that this Transformer does not require a contract or purpose statement! Why do you think that is?
