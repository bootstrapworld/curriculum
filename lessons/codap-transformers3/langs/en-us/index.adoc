== Transforming Columns @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _transform columns_ using the `Transform Attribute` Transformer.

=== Launch
Suppose we want to _transform_ our table, converting `pounds` to `kilograms` or `weeks` to `days`. The `Transform Attribute` Transformer makes that possible!

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Complete the worksheet @printable-exercise{pages/codap-transform.adoc} in the @starter-file{animals} in CODAP.

The `Transform Attribute` Transformer walks through the table, applying whatever expression it was given to each row. Whatever the expression produces for that row becomes the value of the column; we name that column when we create the Transformer. In the first example, we gave the Transformer `Age < 5` as its expression, so the new table replaced the age with an indication of whether each animal is young (`true`) or not (`false`).

=== Synthesize
Debrief with students. Ask them if they can think of a situation where they would want to use this. Some ideas:

- A dataset from Europe might list everything in metric (centimeters, kilograms, etc), so we use `Transform Attribute` to convert to imperial units (inches, pounds, etc).
- A dataset about schools might include columns for how many students are in the school and how many of those students identify as multi-racial. But when comparing schools of different sizes, what we really want is a column showing what _percentage_ of students identify as multi-racial. We could use `Transform Attribute` to compute that for every row in the table.

== Building Columns @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _build columns_, using the `Build Attribute` Transformer.

=== Launch
So far, we've used Transformers to _filter_ and to _transform an attribute_. The final Transformer we are exploring today is called `Build Attribute`. Can you guess what this Transformer does and how it might be similar to _and_ different from `Transform Attribute`?

=== Investigate

Now that students have some familiarity with creating and defining Transformers, invite them to explore `Build Attribute` to see if they can determine what it does. (It creates an additional column in the dataset, rather than _transforming_ the existing column.)

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete the worksheet @printable-exercise{pages/codap-build.adoc} in the @starter-file{animals} in CODAP.


=== Synthesize
Debrief with students. Ask them if they can think of a situation where they would want to use this. Some ideas:

- How is `Build Attribute` similar to `Transform Attribute`? How are they different?
** _``Build Attribute`` creates an additional column, using the expression that we provide. `Transform Attribute` converts an existing column, using the expression that we provide._
- When might it make more sense to _build_ an attribute, rather than to _transform_ it?
** _We would build rather than transform if we want to do comparisons across columns, or need to preserve the original column for any reason (e.g., we want measurements in metric and standard units.)_

Being able to create and define a Transformer  is a _huge_ upgrade in our ability to analyze data! But as a wise person once said, "with great power comes great responsibility"! Dropping all the dogs from our dataset might be a cute exercise in this class, but suppose we want to drop certain populations from a national census? Even a small programming error could erase millions of people, impact funding for things like roads and schools, etc.
