== Intro to Linear Regression @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the _concept_ of @vocab{linear regression}, and learn how to interpret the @vocab{slope} and @vocab{y-intercept} of @vocab{predictor functions}.

_For teachers who have the need and the bandwidth to go deeper, this is a good opportunity to teach the algorithm behind linear regression. This algorithm is not part of Bootstrap:Data Science._

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students turn to Part 1 of @printable-exercise{lr-plot-intro.adoc} and consider the scatter plots for weeks-v-pounds and weeks-v-age.

Quickly survey the class about whether they think we can use an animal’s size or age to predict how long it will take to be adopted.

- _A scatter plot of adoption time versus size does suggest that smaller animals get adopted faster than larger animals._
- _Similarly, younger animals tend to be adopted faster than older ones._
--

Can we be more precise about this, and actually _predict_ how long it will take an animal to be adopted, based on these factors? And which one would give us a better prediction?

[.lesson-point]
Just as the mean, median, and mode can summarize data from a _single quantitative variable_, the “center” of points in a _two-dimensional_ cloud can be described by a @vocab{line of best fit}. Given a value for the @vocab{explanatory variable}, this line allows us to predict what the corresponding value for the @vocab{response variable} might be.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Data scientists use a statistical method called @vocab{linear regression} to pinpoint linear relationships in a dataset. Linear regression is the math behind the @vocab{line of best fit}, which allows us to make predictions based on our data.

When we draw our @vocab{line of best fit} on a scatter plot, we can imagine a rubber band stretching vertically between the line itself and each point in the plot -- every point pulls the line a little “up” or “down”.

The line can be described by a @vocab{predictor function}.

@span{.title}{Vocabulary Note}

We prefer the words “explanatory” and “response” in our curriculum, because in other contexts the words “dependent” and “independent” refer to whether or not the variables are related at all, as opposed to what role each plays in the relationship.

The straight line that best fits the points on a scatter plot has several names, depending on the context, subject, or grade level. All of the following terms refer to the same concept:

_Regression Line - Line of Best Fit - Least Squares Line - Predictor - Trendline_

The line itself is computed through a process called _linear regression_, which also goes by the name _least squares regression_.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to Part 2 of @printable-exercise{lr-plot-intro.adoc} and answer the questions using the @online-exercise{https://www.geogebra.org/m/ZcVIxKtF, Interactive Regression Line}.

Debrief as a class.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/drawing-predictors.adoc}.
* Draw a @vocab{line of best fit} through each of the scatter plots.
* Decide whether the _direction_ of the correlation (which could also be referred to as the slope of the line) is positive or negative.
* Then assess the strength of the correlation.

=== Common Misconceptions
* *Don't forget to look at sample size!* A linear regression plot with an @math{r}-value of 0.999 is strong...but that's useless if it's a sample of just three datapoints!

=== Synthesize
Give students some time to experiment, then share back observations.

== Linear Regression in Pyret @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the `lr-plot` function in Pyret, which performs a linear regression and plots the result.

=== Launch
Pyret includes a powerful display called `lr-plot`, which (1) draws a scatter plot, (2) draws the line of best fit, and (3) even displays the equation for that line:

Just like the `scatter-plot` function, `lr-plot` takes in a Table and the names of *3 Columns*, the first of which will be used to label the points.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open your saved Animals Starter File, or @starter-file{animals, make a new copy}.
- Create an `lr-plot` for the `animals-table`.
** Use `"name"` for the labels.
** Use `"age"` for the x-axis.
** Use `"weeks"` for the y-axis.

@right{@image{images/lr-explained.png, LR explained, 400}}

. The resulting scatter plot looks like those we’ve seen before!

. The @vocab{line of best fit} is now drawn onto the plot.

. Above the display we see the @vocab{predictor function} for that line.

**  The predictor function is written in slope-intercept form.
(@math{y = mx + b}, where @math{m} describes the @vocab{slope} or @vocab{rate of change} and @math{b} identifies the @vocab{y-intercept}.)

** In this plot, we can see that the slope of the line is `0.792`, which means that on average, each extra year of age results in an extra @math{0.792} weeks of waiting to be adopted (about 5 or 6 extra days).

** The y-intercept is `2.285`. This is where the best-fitting line crosses the y-axis.  We want to be careful not to interpret this too literally, and say that a newborn animal would be adopted in 2.285 weeks, because none of the animals in our dataset was that young. Still, the @vocab{regression line} (or @vocab{line of best fit}) suggests that a baby animal, whose age is close to 0, would take only about 3 weeks to be adopted.

** By subsituting an animal's age for _x_ in the predictor function, we can make a _prediction_ about how many weeks it will take to be adopted.

** For example, we predict a 4-year-old animal to be adopted in @math{0.792(3) + 2.285 = 4.665} weeks. That’s the y-value when @math{ x = 3} for a point that falls exactly on the regression line.

. We also see the @math{r}-value is `+0.442`.

** The sign is positive, consistent with the fact that the scatter plot point cloud and line of best fit, slope upward.

** The fact that the @math{r}-value is close to @math{0.5} tells us that the strength is moderate.

** This makes sense: the scatter plot points are somewhere between being really tightly clustered and really loosely scattered.

@span{.title}{Going Deeper}

Students may notice another value in the lr-plot, called @math{R^2}. This value describes the _percentage of the variation in the y-variable that is explained by least-squares regression on the x variable_. In other words, an @math{R^2} value of 0.20 could mean that “20% of the variation in adoption time is explained by regressing adoption time on the age of the animal”. Discussion of @math{R^2} may be appropriate for older students, or in an AP Statistics class.
|===

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{lr-plot-explore.adoc}.
- Complete @printable-exercise{which-questions-make-sense.adoc}.
- _Optional:_ Open @opt-starter-file{height} to explore the same student dataset broken down by gender identity using @opt-printable-exercise{age-v-height-explore.adoc}.

=== Synthesize

A predictor __only makes sense within the range of the data that was used to generate it__.

Toddlers grow a lot faster than adults. A regression line predicting the height of toddlers based on age would predict that a 60-year-old is 10 feet tall!

Statistical models are just proxies for the real world, drawn from a limited sample of data: they might make a useful prediction in the range of that data, but once we try to extrapolate beyond that data we may quickly get into trouble!

@span{.title}{Simpson's Paradox}

A common misconception is that "more data is always better", and the age-v-height worksheet challenges that assumption. Two sub-groups (girls and boys) can each have a strong correlation between age and height, but when they are combined the correlation is weaker. This phenomenon is called @link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox, Simpson's Paradox}. Statistics (especially AP!) teachers will want to dive deeper on this topic.

== Interpreting LR Plots @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _write_ about the results of a linear regression, using proper statistical terminology and thinking through the many ways this language can be misused.

=== Launch
How well can you interpret the results of a linear regression analysis? How would you explain it to someone else?

[.lesson-instruction]
- What does it mean when a data point is _above_ the line of best fit?
** _It means the y-value is higher than the sample would have predicted for that x-value._
- What does it mean when a data point is _below_ the line of best fit?
** _It means the y-value is lower than the sample would have predicted for that x-value._
- Turn to @printable-exercise{interpreting-regression-lines-n-rvalues.adoc}, and fill in the blanks for each scenario on the left using information from the @vocab{predictor function} and @vocab{r-value} on the right.

Let's take a look at how the Data Cycle can be used with Linear Regression, and how the result can be used to form our Data Story.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Read @printable-exercise{pages/regression-analysis-example.adoc}.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
- Do the `Ask Questions` and `Consider Data` steps match each other? Why or why not?
** _Yes. We're thinking about how age of cats impact time to adoption by looking a the cat rows and comparing `age` and `weeks`._
- At the bottom of the page we have the _Data Story_ for this question, which includes the results of the analysis and a responsible way to write about them.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{describing-relationships-1.adoc}.
- Using the language you saw on @printable-exercise{regression-analysis-example.adoc}, how would you write up the findings on this page?
- Optional: For more practice, you can complete @opt-printable-exercise{describing-relationships-2.adoc}.

=== Common Misconceptions
* *Don't call it "accuracy"!* One of the most common misconceptions about Linear Regression is that the @math{r} or @math{R^2} value is a _measure of accuracy._ For example, a student who sees a very high @math{r}-value when plotting age vs. weeks might say "this prediction is 95% accurate." But these values only speak to _how much variation in the y-axis can be explained by variation in the x-axis_, so the statement should be "95% of the variation in weeks can be explained by variation in the age."
* *X and Y matter!* The correlation coefficient will be the same, even if you swap the x- and y-axes. However, the _interpretation_ of the display is different! The column used for the x-axis will always be interpreted as "the explanation" for the "result" seen in the y-axis. It's fine to say that being older tends to make an animal take longer to be adopted, but it is *not true* that taking longer to be adopted makes an animal older!

=== Synthesize
Have students read their data stories aloud, to get comfortable with the phrasing.

== Your Analysis @duration{flexible}

=== Overview
Students repeat the previous activity, this time applying it to their own dataset and interpreting their own results. *Note: this activity can be done briefly as a homework assignment, but we recommend giving students an _additional class period_ to work on this.*

=== Launch
Now that you've gotten some practice performing linear regression on the Animals Dataset, it's time to apply that knowledge to your own data!

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Ask your questions and tell your story on @printable-exercise{regression-analysis-1.adoc}.
- Fill in the Correlations portion of your @starter-file{research-paper}, using the scatter plots and linear regression plots they've constructed for their dataset and explaining what they show.

=== Synthesize
Have students share their findings with the class. Get excited about the connections they are making and the conclusions they are drawing! Encourage students to make suggestions to one another about further analysis.

@right{@image{images/lin-reg-2.png, lin reg 2, 400}}

The word “linear” in “linear regression” is important here. In the image on the right, there’s clearly a pattern, but it doesn’t look like a straight line!

There are many other kinds of statistical models out there, but all of them work the same way: use a particular kind of mathematical function (linear or otherwise), to figure out how to get the “best fit” for a cloud of data.
