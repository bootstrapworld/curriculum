@fitb{95%}{The slope is positive (0.23) and R=0.566, so there is a moderate relationship }

+b.+ What new question(s) does this raise?

@fitb{95%}{Is the relationship different for other animals?}

@fitb{95%}{Is the relationship different for fixed v. unfixed cats?}

_Write your Data Story below:_

I performed a linear regression on a sample of @fitbruby{60ex}{}{dataset or subset} and found @fitbruby{80ex}{}{a weak/strong/moderate (R=...), positive/negative} correlation between @fitbruby{60ex}{}{[x-axis]} and @fitbruby{60ex}{}{[y-axis]}. I would predict that a 1 @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[increase/decrease]} in @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[y-axis]}.
