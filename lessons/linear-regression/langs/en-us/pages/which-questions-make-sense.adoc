@n About how many inches are kids in this dataset expected to grow per year? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_3 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a child were 45" tall at age eight, how tall would you expect them to be at age twelve? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_57 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a ten-year-old were 55" tall at age 11, how tall would you expect them to have been at age 9? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_49 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Using the equation, how tall would you expect a seven-year-old child to be? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_46.6 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n How many of the seven-year-olds in this sample are actually that height? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_zero!_}}

@n Using the equation, determine the expected height of someone who is...
