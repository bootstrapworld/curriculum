@n About how many inches are kids in this dataset expected to grow per year? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_3 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a child were 45" tall at age eight, how tall would you expect them to be at age twelve? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_57 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a ten-year-old were 55" tall at age 11, how tall would you expect them to have been at age 9? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_49 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Using the equation, how tall would you expect a seven-year-old child to be? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_46.6 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n How many of the seven-year-olds in this sample are actually that height? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_zero!_}}

@n Using the equation, determine the expected height of someone who is...

@n For which ages is this predictor function likely to be the *most* accurate? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Only ages within the range of the dataset. This function might be incredibly accurate for this population_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_but that doesn't mean it's accurate for other populations! A great predictor for the heights of students at a_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_basketball training camp could be a terrible predictor when used with students at a gymnastics camp._}

@n For which ages is this predictor function likely to be the *least* accurate? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_The regression might still work for extrapolating the height of a 6-year-old or a 13-year-old,_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_since they are just beyond the range of the dataset, but it makes no sense to use this equation to figure_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_out the height of a 90-year-old or babies, because humans don't grow at a constant rate for their entire life!_}}
