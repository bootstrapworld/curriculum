@n About how many inches are kids in this dataset expected to grow per year? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{3 inches}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a child were 45" tall at age eight, how tall would you expect them to be at age twelve? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{57 inches}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a ten-year-old were 55" tall, how tall would you expect them to have been at age 9? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{49 inches}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Using the equation, how tall would you expect a seven-year-old child to be? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{46.6 inches}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n How many of the seven-year-olds in this sample are actually that height? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{zero!}}

@n Using the equation, determine the expected height of someone who is...

@n For which ages is this predictor function likely to be the *most* accurate? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Only ages within the range of the dataset. This function might be incredibly accurate for this population}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{but that doesn't mean it's accurate for other populations! A great predictor for the heights of students at a}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{basketball training camp could be a terrible predictor when used with students at a gymnastics camp.}}

@n For which ages is this predictor function likely to be the *least* accurate? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The regression might still work for extrapolating the height of a 6-year-old or a 13-year-old,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{out the height of a 90-year-old or babies, because humans don't grow at a constant rate for their entire life!}}
