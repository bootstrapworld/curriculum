_Write your Data Story below:_

I performed a linear regression on a sample of @fitbruby{60ex}{cats at the shelter}{dataset or subset} and found @fitbruby{80ex}{moderate, positive}{a weak/strong/moderate (R=...), positive/negative} correlation between @fitbruby{60ex}{age}{[x-axis]} and @fitbruby{60ex}{time to adoption}{[y-axis]}. I would predict that a 1 @fitbruby{20ex}{year}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20ex}{age}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{30ex}{.23}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{30ex}{week}{[increase/decrease]} in @fitbruby{30ex}{time to adoption}{[y-axis]}.
