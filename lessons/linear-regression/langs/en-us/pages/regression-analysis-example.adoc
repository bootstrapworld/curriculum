_Write your Data Story below:_


I performed a linear regression on a sample of @fitbruby{60ex}{cats at the shelter}{[dataset or subset]} and found @fitbruby{80ex}{moderate, positive}{a weak / strong / moderate (R=...), positive / negative} correlation between @fitbruby{60ex}{age}{[x-axis]} and @fitbruby{60ex}{time to adoption}{[y-axis]}. I would predict that a 1 @fitbruby{20ex}{year}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20ex}{age}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{30ex}{.23 week}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{30ex}{increase}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{30ex}{time to adoption}{[y-axis]}.
