|*1*
| For every additional Marvel Universe movie released each year, the average person is predicted to consume @fitbruby{15ex}{@ifsoln{3.19}}{[amount]} @fitbruby{15ex}{@ifsoln{fewer}}{[more / fewer]} pounds of sugar! This correlation is @fitbruby{40ex}{@ifsoln{practically non-existent}}{[strong, moderate, weak, practically non-existent]}.

| Shoe size and height are @fitbruby{30ex}{@ifsoln{strongly}}{[strongly, moderately, weakly, not]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{positively}}{[positively / negatively]} correlated. If person A is one size bigger than person B, we predict that they will be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{1.65}}{[amount]} inches taller than person B as well.

| There is @fitbruby{30ex}{@ifsoln{no}}{[a strong, a moderate, no]} relationship found between the number of Uber drivers in a city and the number of babies born each year.

| The correlation between weeks-of-school-missed and SAT score is @fitbruby{40ex}{@ifsoln{moderate}}{[strong, moderate, weak, practically non-existent]} and @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{negative}}{[positive / negative]}. For every week a student misses, we predict a @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{15.3}}{[amount]} point @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{drop}}{[gain / drop]} in their SAT score.

| There is a @fitbruby{40ex}{@ifsoln{weak}}{[strong, moderate, weak, practically non-existent]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{@ifsoln{positive}}{[positive / negative]} correlation between the number of streaming video services someone has, and how much they weigh. For each service, we expect them to be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{@ifsoln{1.6}}{[amount]} pounds heavier.
