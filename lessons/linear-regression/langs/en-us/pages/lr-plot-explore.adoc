*Part 1: You should already have plotted @show{(code '(lr-plot animals-table "name" "age" "weeks"))} in the @starter-file{animals}...*

@n What is the predictor function? @math{y =} @fitb{5em}{} @math{x +} @fitb{5em}{}

@n What is the slope? @fitb{}{}

@n What is the y-intercept? @fitb{}{}

@n How long would our line of best fit predict it would take for a 5 year-old animal to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 6 weeks}}

@n What if they were a newborn, or just 0 years old? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 2 weeks}}

@n Does it make sense to find the adoption time for a newborn using this predictor function? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's not very reliable, given that none of the animals in the dataset are newborns.}}

*Part 2: Make another lr-plot, but this time use the animals' weight as our explanatory variable instead of their age.*

@n How long would our line of best fit predict it would take for an animal weighing 21 pounds to be adopted? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 4 weeks}}

@n What if they weighed 0.1 pounds? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 2.5 weeks}}

*Part 3: `lr-plot` with filtered tables...*

@n Make another `lr-plot`, comparing the `age` v. `weeks` columns for _only the cats_ using the following code:

[.indentedpara .forceShading]
--
``fun is-cat(r): r["species"] == "cat" end
lr-plot(filter(animals-table, is-cat), "name", "age", "weeks")
``
--

@n What is the predictor function? @math{y =} @fitb{5em}{} @math{x +} @fitb{5em}{}

@n What is the slope? @fitb{}{}

@n What is the y-intercept? @fitb{}{}

@n How does this line of best fit for _cats_ compare to the line of best fit for _all animals_?

@fitb{}{}

@n How long would our line of best fit predict it would take for a 5 year-old cat to be adopted? @fitb{}{}
