== Translating and Transforming Expressions @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students analyze expressions in words and consider all of the different possible Circles of Evaluation they can create.

=== Launch

Believe it or not, _every_ mathematical expression we encounter can be transformed in one way or another!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to Transforming an Expression in Words. At the top of this page, you see an expression: _Find one-third of 27. Now add five._
- Draw a Circle of Evaluation to represent this expression as precisely as possible.
- Label the first arrow on the left with a property that you know you can apply to transform this Circle. Draw its Transformation.
- Repeat the process. How many different results did we come up with?

Encourage students to apply all of the different Circle Transformations that they have learned about, including: Computation as a Transformation, the Associative Property, the Distributive Property, and combinations of any of the above.

Note: This might be a good opportunity to revisit the list of different categories of Circle Transformations that you developed during the opening lesson. How have students understanding of Circle Transformations evolved?

=== Investigate

Note: Students can complete this activity using either two sets of printed cards, or the interactive Desmos version.

[.lesson-instruction]
- With your partner, carefully examine the four expressions in words that are on the cards labeled "A". Lay them out neatly on the table in front of you.
- Place the "B" cards in a pile. Take turns looking at cards and anlyzing the Circles on them. Sort each of the "B" cards with the expression in words that it matches.
- Be aware that the Circles represent various Transformations of the expression in words!

As students sort the cards, encourage them to talk to one another, explain their reasoning, and - when in doubt - apply Computation to confirm equivalence.

=== Synthesize

- Were there any cards that were especially easy to match? Especially difficult?
- Are there any Circle Transformations that you generally have a tough time recognizing?
