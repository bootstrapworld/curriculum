In earlier lessons, we looked at changes in American jobs from the late 1800s to 2002. We saw that many modern jobs are in cities rather than in the countryside. The following line chart displays the proportion of Americans who have lived in cities during the years from 1800 to 2000.

@n What proportion of Americans lived in cities in 1800: about 0.05, 0.25, or 0.50?

@n In 1790, only 1 out of 20 Americans lived in cities. By what year did about 16 out of 20 (proportion 0.80) of Americans live in cities: 1950, 1975, or 2000?

@n What trend do you see in the proportion of Americans living in U.S. Cities from 1800-2000?

BONUS: What would a line chart for proportion living in the countryside during those same years  look like?  Sketch the line into this blank chart â†’
