*Heads Up*

- Most data was taken from 27th December, 2021 when cases were picking up across US due to the Delta and Omicron variant.
- No US territories are mentioned. Some larger cities such as New York City were also removed in the data cleaning process
- Some values for Dose 1 Administered and its % equivalents were set at 0 although it is unlikely that this is the case. It is likely that the information was not available on that particular date.
