//Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
//to deepen the analysis. For example:
//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school.
//- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
//  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

- *define a function* little-liberty, which returns true if a country's civil liberties index is between 6 & 7.
- *define a function* much-liberty, which returns true if a country's civil liberties index is between 1 & 2.
- *define a function* little-security, which returns true if a country’s personal security index is <40.
- *define a function* much-security, which returns true if a country’s personal security index is >60.
- *define a function* little-development, which returns true if a country’s human development index is <0.4.
- *define a function* much-development, which returns true if a country’s human development index is >0.6.
- *define a function* high-indices, which returns true if a country's much-liberty, much-security, & much-development all return true.

*Heads Up*

//List any recommended calculations below. For example:
//
//- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
//  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
//  percentages would need to be calculated.
//- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
//  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.
