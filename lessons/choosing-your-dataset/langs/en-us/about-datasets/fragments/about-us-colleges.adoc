= Colleges in the US (2019-2020)

This dataset includes data from 3232 post-secondary educational institutions in the United States during the school year (2019-2020).

Students applying to colleges can use this dataset to evaluate their options given their monetary, locational, and other preferences.

This data set has a huge number of columns that will excite some students and may overwhelm others.

The columns of this data set require calculations to convert data before students start making graphs.

Students should filter out a list of all schools in their state and compare them.
Students should filter out a list of all schools in the “1500+” Converted SAT Range and compare them with a filtered list of all schools with less than 0.1 acceptance rate.

*Have students...*

- *define* a function all-pell-grant, which computes the total number of undergraduate students in all universities that received a Pell grant.

- *define* a function same-tuition, which returns true if a school has the same in-state and out-of-state tuition.

- *define* a function average-fin-aid, which returns the difference between a school’s cost of attendance and net price.

- *define* a function low-accept, which returns true if a school has less than a 10% acceptance rate.


*Heads Up*

Note that a few schools may have a negative net price, suggesting that some students may actually end up receiving money for attending the particular school.
Acceptance rates of 1 mean virtually everyone is accepted, though there may still be special circumstances in which a particular student is rejected.
Some schools lacking significant data may be excluded from this dataset of 3232 colleges.
