//- This dataset includes data from 271 Rhode Island public &
//  charter schools.
//- This data set looks at traffic stops in Durham, NC
//  between 2002 and 2013, recording the number of them that resulted in searches of the person
//  stopped. Data is broken down by age, race and sex.

//Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
//to deepen the analysis. For example:
//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school.
//- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
//  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

- *define a function* average-ranks-wurlitzer, which takes the average number of ranks for all organs made by Wurlitzer. Do this for a few of these major organ companies as well: Austin, Noack, Hook & Hastings, MÃ¶ller, Casavant, and Aeolian-Skinner.

- *define a function* ranks-stops-difference which computes the difference between an organ's number of ranks and its number of stops.
