= Arctic Sea Ice

This dataset combines data on Arctic sea ice, global mean sea level variation, global average temperature anomalies, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

- This data set has a limited number of categories, making it accessible to any student.

- The columns of this data set are defined to allow students to start analysis without much additional coding.

*Column Titles:* 
January Average Global Temperature Anomaly, February Average Global Temperature Anomaly, 
March Average Global Temperature Anomaly, April Average Global Temperature Anomaly,  
May Average Global Temperature Anomaly, June Average Global Temperature Anomaly, July Average Global Temperature Anomaly, August Average Global Temperature Anomaly, September Average Global Temperature Anomaly, October Average Global Temperature Anomaly, November Average Global Temperature Anomaly, December Average Global Temperature Anomaly, Anual Average Global Temperature Anomaly, Average Sea Ice Extent in the Arctic, Minimum Sea Ice Extent in the Arctic, Month Minimum Sea Ice Extent in the Arctic Occurred, Month Maximum Sea Ice Extent in the Arctic Occurred, Global Mean Sea Level Variation, GLobal CO2 Levels.

*Have students...*

- *define a function* variation-over-time which computes how much a variable has changed within a span of any two years. 

*Heads Up*

- The difference between the maximum and minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic can be calculated to show the range in sea ice extent per year and how that may fluctuate.
