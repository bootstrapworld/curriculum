= Earthquake sequences, 2000-2021, Magnitude 7+
 
This dataset looks at earthquake sequences recorded by the US Geological Survey that occured from 2000 to 2021, with the mainshock having a magnitude >= 7.0. The dataset contains the geographic and economic information about the location, geologic data, and death/injury tolls.
This dataset can be used to analyze what factors affect earthquakes, and model what makes an earthquake severe.
This dataset has a large number of columns (18) that will excite some students and may overwhelm others. The columns of this dataset are defined to allow students to start analysis without much additional coding.


*Column Titles:* Timestamp, Location, GDP (Millions of USD), GDP per Capita (nearest USD), Year, Month, Weekday, Latitude, Longitude, Depth (km), Magnitude, Over Land?, Type of Earthquake, Plate No1, Plate No2, Tsunami?, Death Toll, Injury Toll

*Have students...*

- *define a function* high-toll, which returns true if a death and injury toll are higher than a certain threshold (to be determined by the student)
- *define a function* pct-pacific, which computes the percentage of earthquakes that happen along a boundary of the Pacific plate.

*Heads Up*
- It may be useful to combine death and injury tolls for correlation analysis.
- The columns Depth, Magnitude, Death Toll, and Injury Toll all skew right.
- The weakness of correlations in this data may prompt a discussion about sampling bias - this data only considers earthquakes with magnitude 7.0 or greater. The magnitude scale ranges from 0-10, so this subset is certainly not representative of all earthquakes.
- *Outliers to be aware of:* there are some earthquakes with unusually high death/injury rates. Scatterplots including these will likely flatten all other data if using a linear axis.
