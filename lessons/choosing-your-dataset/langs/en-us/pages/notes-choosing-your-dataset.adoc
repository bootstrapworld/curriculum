= Choosing Your Dataset

@vspace{1ex}

When selecting a dataset to explore, _pick something that matters to you!_  You'll be working with this data for a while, so you don't want to pick something at random just to get it done.

When choosing a dataset, it's a good idea to consider a few factors:

@vspace{2ex}

. Is it *interesting*? Pick a dataset you're genuinely interested in, so that you can explore questions that matter to you!

. Is it *relevant*? Pick a dataset that deals with something personally relevant to you and your community! Does this data impact you in any way? Are there questions you have about the dataset that mean something to you or someone you know?

. Is it *familiar*? Pick a dataset you know about, so you can use your expertise to deepen your analysis! You wouldn't be able to make samples of the Animals Dataset properly if you didn't know that some animals are much bigger or longer-lived than others.
