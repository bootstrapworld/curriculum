= Consider and Analyze

Fill in the tables below by considering the rows and columns you need, then look up the Contract for that display you'll use to analyze them. Finally, record the code you need to make it in Pyret. If time allows, try typing it in to see your display! _The first column has been filled in for you._


@n A `pie-chart` showing the `species` of animals from the shelter.
[cols="^1,^1,^1",options="header"]

| Which Rows?			| Which Column(s)?		| What will you Create?
| _All the animals_		| @ifsoln{_species_}	| @ifsoln{_pie chart_}

*code:* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`pie-chart(animals-table, "species")`}}
