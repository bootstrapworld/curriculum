= Samples from My Dataset

Think back to when we defined grouped samples from the Animals Table, like "puppies", "old cats", etc. What grouped samples would be useful for _your_ dataset? List a few of these in the first column.

Then, for each one, what function will identify if a row `r` is
in the subset?
