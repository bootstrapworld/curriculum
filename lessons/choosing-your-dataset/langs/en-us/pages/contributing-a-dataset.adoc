= Contributing a Dataset

@vspace{2ex}

Do you have a dataset you'd like to share with the world? Do you have an enhanced version of one of our existing datasets? Send it our way!

Of course, there's a lot more to building a classroom-approachable dataset than uploading a CSV file! Blank cells, columns that mix Numbers and Strings, or columns with inconsistent units can wreak havoc on a student who's learning to analyze data.

Bootstrap is a co-author of the @link{https://www.BootstrapWorld.org, Datasheets for K-12 Classroom Datasets} spec, along with @link{https://www.Code.org, Code.org}. This specification gives curriculum providers like us the information we need to provide high-quality, student-ready datasets. You can upload your CSV file along with the datasheet by filling out @link{https://forms.google.com, this form}.
