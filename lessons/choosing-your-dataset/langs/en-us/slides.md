# Review

Let's get some practice isolating the Rows and Columns needed to answer various questions, and use our knowledge of Contracts to help turn those questions into working code!

# Choosing a Dataset

**Data Science: it's all about YOU!**

We live in a world filled with data, gathered about almost every subject you can imagine.

- Climate sensors are gathering data on temperature, humidity, oxygen and more...practically everywhere on the globe.
- Census data tracks the number of different groups of people, as well as their education, income level, and more.
- Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google gather massive amounts of data on the websites you visit, what you chat about online, what you purchase, etc.

# Choosing a Dataset

This data is used to set public policy, draw voting districts, approve drugs, calculate school funding, decide which advertisements you see, and more.

* Where else do you see data being gathered?
* What are some other ways data is used in the world around you?

# Choosing a Dataset

**Here Come the Datasets!**

Working in pairs, explore the list of @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/lessons/choosing-your-dataset/index.shtml?pathway=data-science#Datasets, provided datasets}. 

Which one is the most interesting to you?

When you've selected a dataset to work on, open the Starter File and save a copy.

<!--
_Students can also find their own dataset_, and use this @starter-file{blank-ds}. See this @link{https://youtu.be/uqm9F_tmIho, tutorial video} for help importing your own data into Pyret.

# Choosing a Dataset

* Look at the spreadsheet for your dataset. What do you *Notice*? What do you *Wonder*?
* Complete @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}, making sure to include at least two questions that __can__ be answered by their dataset and one that __cannot__.

# Choosing a Dataset

- What did you select, and why?
- What questions did you come up with?

For the rest of this course, you'll be learning new programming and Data Science skills, practicing them with the Animals Dataset and then applying them to you own data.

# Exploring Your Dataset 

By now you've already learned what to do when you approach a new dataset.

- With the Animals Dataset, you first read the data itself, and wrote down your Notices and Wonders.
- You described the columns in the Animals Dataset, identifying which were categorical and which were quantitative, and whether they were Numbers, Strings, Booleans, etc.
- You took random samples of the dataset, to explore inference and probability

Now, you're doing to do the same thing **with your own dataset.**

# Exploring Your Dataset 

- Make a copy of @starter-file{exploration-paper}, and open the starter file for your chosen dataset.
- Why does this dataset matter? Where did it come from? Complete the first set of questions in the exploration paper.
- In the Definitions Area, use `random-rows` to define *at least three* tables of different sizes: `tiny-sample`, `small-sample`, and `medium-sample`.

What are the categorical columns in _your_ dataset? How are the values distributed?

- What is the distribution of data in your categorical columns? Turn to Complete @printable-exercise{data-cycle-categorical.adoc}, and use the Data Cycle to generate pie and bar charts.
- What do these charts tell you? Add the images of these charts - along with your interpretation! - to the "Making Displays" section of your @starter-file{exploration-paper}.
- Do these displays bring up any interesting questions? If so, add them to the end of the document.

- What dataset did you choose? 
- Why is it interesting or important to you?
- What did your pie and bar charts tell you?
