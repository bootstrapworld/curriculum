= Choosing Your Dataset

@description{Students practice making a variety of chart types and then begin to investigate a real world dataset, which they will continue to work with for the remainder of the course. }

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Explain why they chose their dataset
* Describe their dataset
* Make subsets from their dataset

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's all choose an interesting dataset to investigate.

| Preparation
|
* Decide how much choice you're ready to offer your students before you begin. Research shows that choice increases student engagement! But focusing the whole class on a single dataset is also an option.
** Would focusing your students on a single dataset make this doable for you? Because you teach younger students who might need more scaffolding? Or because you are new to teaching data science and managing fewer moving parts would increase your confidence? We recommend focusing on @opt-starter-file{food}.
** Are you ready to jump straight into supporting your students in working on a wide range of topics of their choosing? We have a full dataset library!
** Want to give students choice from a shorter curated list... to shorten the decision-making process, focus on topics related to curriculur goals, or just to have fewer options to manage during class?  We've assembled @link{about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.html, descriptions of individual datasets here}. For those looking for a precurated shorter list, we've starred a few of them for you.
** *If you have time*, you may want to complete all of the lessons with everyone getting extra practice analyzing @opt-starter-file{food} and then have your students choose a dataset to analyze for their culminating research papers!

* All students (or pairs) should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Animals Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can open the @starter-file{animals}.

== Review @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students practice making lots of chart types, focusing specifically on the "Consider Data" step in the Data Cycle and how it can be used alongside Contracts to help go from questions to code.

=== Launch
Let's get some practice isolating the Rows and Columns needed to answer various questions, and use our knowledge of Contracts to help turn those questions into working code!

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{consider-and-analyze.adoc}.

Be sure to review student answers.

== Choosing a Dataset @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students select a dataset that interests them, and do some thinking about _why_ it interests them, _what questions they'd like to answer_ and _what hypotheses they have_. They'll be analyzing this data for a long time, so it's critical to ensure a high degree of buy-in before signing off on a student's choice!

*If you are opting to focus your whole class on a single dataset, we recommend skipping to the Exploring Your Dataset section of this lesson and using the dataset provided there.* _(It focuses on global food supply and production through environmental / geographic / cultural lenses and the variables were carefully selected to make sure it lends itself well for all kinds of data displays and discussions. You can, of course, opt to choose any dataset you'd like, from our library or otherwise.)_

=== Launch

[.lesson-point]
Data Science: it's all about YOU!

What data matters to *_you?_* What questions do *_you_* care about? We live in a world filled with data, gathered about almost every subject you can imagine.

- Climate sensors are gathering data on temperature, humidity, oxygen and more...practically everywhere on the globe.
- Census data tracks the number of different groups of people, as well as their education, income level, and more.
- Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google gather massive amounts of data on the websites you visit, what you chat about online, what you purchase, etc.

This data is used to set public policy, draw voting districts, approve drugs, calculate school funding, decide which advertisements you see, and more.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Where else do you see data being gathered?
* What are some other ways data is used in the world around you?

Below is a list of every @vocab{dataset} already provided to students, with a corresponding Starter File that instantly imports the (cleaned) data into Pyret.

_Students can also find their own dataset_, and use this @starter-file{blank-ds}. See this @link{https://youtu.be/uqm9F_tmIho, tutorial video} for help importing your own data into Pyret.

=== Investigate
Have students choose a dataset that is interesting to them and save a copy of it in their programs!

@include{fragments/dataset-table.adoc}

=== Synthesize
Have students share which datasets they chose, and why they are interesting or important to them. What questions did they come up with?

For the rest of this course, you'll be learning new programming and @vocab{Data Science} skills, practicing them with the Animals Dataset and then applying them to you own data.

== Exploring Your Dataset @duration{Start Today... continue in Upcoming Lessons}

=== Overview

Students apply what they've learned about describing and making subsets from the Animals Dataset to their own dataset. _If your students will all be focusing on the same dataset, we recommend using @opt-starter-file{food}._

=== Launch
By now you've already learned what to do when you approach a new dataset.

- With the Animals Dataset, you first read the data itself, and wrote down your Notices and Wonders.
- You described the columns in the Animals Dataset, identifying which were @vocab{categorical} and which were @vocab{quantitative}, and whether they were Numbers, Strings, Booleans, etc.
- You took @vocab{random samples} of the dataset, to explore @vocab{inference} and probability.

Now, you're doing to do the same thing _with your own dataset._

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
--
* Look at the spreadsheet or table for your dataset. What do you *Notice*? What do you *Wonder*?
* Complete @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}, making sure to include at least two questions that __can__ be answered by your dataset and one that __cannot__.
* Save a copy of your starter file. In the Definitions Area, use `random-rows` to define *at least three* tables of different sizes: `tiny-sample`, `small-sample`, and `medium-sample`.

Today we will begin working on the @starter-file{exploration-paper}, which will prepare students for writing their research papers. We will return to this in upcoming lessons. We are just going to work on the first section for now.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Make a copy of @starter-file{exploration-paper}, and open the starter file for your dataset.
- Complete the first set of questions in the exploration paper.
- What are the categorical columns in _your_ dataset? How are those values distributed?
- Turn to Complete @printable-exercise{data-cycle-categorical.adoc}, and use the Data Cycle to generate pie and bar charts.
- What do these charts tell you? Add the images of these charts - along with your interpretation! - to the "Making Displays" section of the exploration document.
- Do these displays bring up any interesting questions? If so, add them to the end of the document.

=== Synthesize
Have students share their findings. Were any of them surprising?
