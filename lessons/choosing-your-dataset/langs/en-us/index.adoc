| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Explain why they chose their dataset
* Describe their dataset
* Make subsets from their dataset

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's all choose an interesting dataset to investigate.

| Preparation
|
* Decide whether you'd like your students to have access to our full dataset library or you want to curate a shorter list for them to choose from. (Depending on your goals, some datasets may work better for your class than others.) We've assembled @link{about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.html, descriptions of individual datasets here}. For those looking for a precurated shorter list, we've starred a few of them for you.
* All students (or pairs) should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Animals Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can open the @starter-file{animals}.

== Review @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students practice making lots of chart types, focusing specifically on the "Consider Data" step in the Data Cycle and how it can be used alongside Contracts to help go from questions to code.

=== Launch
Let's get some practice isolating the Rows and Columns needed to answer various questions, and use our knowledge of Contracts to help turn those questions into working code!

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{consider-and-analyze.adoc}.

Be sure to review student answers.


== Choosing a Dataset @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students select a dataset that interests them, and do some thinking about _why_ it interests them, _what questions they'd like to answer_ and _what hypotheses they have_. They'll be analyzing this data for a long time, so *it's critical to ensure a high degree of buy-in before signing off on a student's choice!*

=== Launch

[.lesson-point]
Data Science: it's all about YOU!

What data matters to *_you?_* What questions do *_you_* care about? We live in a world filled with data, gathered about almost every subject you can imagine.

- Climate sensors are gathering data on temperature, humidity, oxygen and more...practically everywhere on the globe.
- Census data tracks the number of different groups of people, as well as their education, income level, and more.
- Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google gather massive amounts of data on the websites you visit, what you chat about online, what you purchase, etc.

This data is used to set public policy, draw voting districts, approve drugs, calculate school funding, decide which advertisements you see, and more.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Where else do you see data being gathered?
* What are some other ways data is used in the world around you?

Here Come the Datasets!
[[Datasets]]

Below is a list of every dataset already provided to students, with a corresponding Starter File that instantly imports the (cleaned) data into Pyret.

_Students can also find their own dataset_, and use this @starter-file{blank-ds}. See this @link{https://youtu.be/uqm9F_tmIho, tutorial video} for help importing your own data into Pyret.

=== Investigate
Have students choose a dataset that is interesting to them and save a copy of it in their programs!

@include{fragments/dataset-table.adoc}

[.lesson-instruction]
--
* Look at the spreadsheet for your dataset. What do you *Notice*? What do you *Wonder*?
* Complete @printable-exercise{pages/my-dataset.adoc}, making sure to include at least two questions that __can__ be answered by their dataset and one that __cannot__.
--

=== Synthesize
- What did you select, and why?
- What questions did you come up with?

For the rest of this course, you'll be learning new programming and Data Science skills, practicing them with the Animals Dataset and then applying them to you own data.

== Exploring Your Dataset @duration{Split this Section across Multiple Days!}

=== Overview
Students apply what they've learned about describing and making subsets from the Animals Dataset to their own dataset. *Note: this section should be broken up across multiple days!* Students should complete each of the investigate sections, then leave ample classtime for discussion and peer-sharing.

=== Launch
By now you've already learned what to do when you approach a new dataset.

- With the Animals Dataset, you first read the data itself, and wrote down your Notices and Wonders.
- You described the columns in the Animals Dataset, identifying which were categorical and which were quantitative, and whether they were Numbers, Strings, Booleans, etc.
- You took random samples of the dataset, to explore inference and probability

Now, you're doing to do the same thing _with your own dataset._

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Make a copy of @starter-file{exploration-paper}, and open the starter file for your chosen dataset.
- Why does this dataset matter? Where did it come from? Complete the first set of questions in the exploration paper.
- In the Definitions Area, use `random-rows` to define *at least three* tables of different sizes: `tiny-sample`, `small-sample`, and `medium-sample`.
- What are the categorical columns in _your_ dataset? How are those values distributed?
- Turn to Complete @printable-exercise{data-cycle-categorical.adoc}, and use the Data Cycle to generate pie and bar charts.
- What do these charts tell you? Add the images of these charts - along with your interpretation! - to the "Making Displays" section of the exploration document.
- Do these displays bring up any interesting questions? If so, add them to the end of the document.

=== Synthesize
Have students share their findings. Were any of them surprising?

=== Synthesize

Have students share which datasets they chose, and why they are interesting or important to them.
