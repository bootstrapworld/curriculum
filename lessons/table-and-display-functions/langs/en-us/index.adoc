== Functions for Working with Tables @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students will be introduced to functions for working with tables, including: @show{(code 'sort)},  @show{(code 'count)} and @show{(code 'first-n-rows)}. In the process they will review simple @vocab{data types} and be introduced to @vocab{contracts} for describing the @vocab{Domain} and @vocab{Range} of any function.

If you have time and interest in digging deeper into contracts, we have a @lesson-link{contracts, whole lesson focused on contracts for image-producing functions}, which students find highly motivating!

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Open the @starter-file{animals} and click "Run".
- In the Interactions Window on the right type `animals-table` and hit "Enter" to see the default view of the table.
- What do you Notice? (sample answers below)
** _We only see the first 10 rows of the table and would have to click to see the remaining 22 rows._
** _The animals aren't listed in any particular order._
- What do you Wonder? (sample answers below)
** _Is it possible to alphabetize the list, or sort it in other ways?_
--

(If this is the first time your students are seeing a table in @starter-file{editor}, you may also want to acknowledge line 7 of the Definitions area, where `animals-table` is defined along with the names of the 8 columns.)


=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students turn to @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables.adoc} and complete numbers 1-6.

- What did these `sort` expressions do?
** _They took in the `animals-table`, the "Name" column, and true or false... producing a new table, sorted alphabetically (A-Z for true and Z-A for false)_
- Just below question 6, we see the contract for `sort`
- What does it mean that the Domain of `sort` is Table, String, Boolean?
** _The functions needs a Table, a String (describing a column), and a Boolean (an order to sort the column by) in order to do its job._
- What does it mean that the Range of `sort` is Table?
** _The function produces a new table._

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students complete question 7-10.

- How did `sort` work with quantitative columns?
** _true sorted the values from least to greatest. false sorted the values from biggest to smallest._
- What new questions did you think of that could be answered using `sort`?

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students complete @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables-cont.adoc}, working with the `count` and `first-n-rows` functions.

=== Synthesize

- How is the function of `count` different from `sort`?
** `sort` _made a new table that was reordered_
** `count` _made a new table that summarized the data from a column of the original table!_
- How does the function `first-n-rows` work?
** _It makes a new smaller table with the number of rows you type into the expression._
- Does anyone have any questions about the functions or expressions you've worked with today?
- Where have you seen tables summarizing counts in the real world?
- How else do journalists and newscasters display summaries of data besides in tables?
** _Ideally someone will say bar charts!_

== Functions for Making Displays @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students will be introduced to functions for making one-variable displays in Pyret, including: @show{(code 'pie-chart)}, @show{(code 'bar-chart)}, @show{(code 'box-plot)} and @show{(code 'histogram)}.

The goal here is for students to become familiar with __using contracts to write expressions that will produce displays__. Knowing how to _make_ a histogram doesn't mean a student really understands histograms! We have dedicated, in-depth lessons that focus on each display mentioned in this lesson:

* @lesson-link{bar-and-pie-charts}
* @lesson-link{histograms}
* @lesson-link{histograms2}
* @lesson-link{box-plots}

We also have dedicated lessons for other displays not mentioned here, such as @lesson-link{scatter-plots}, @lesson-link{linear-regression}, @lesson-link{custom-scatter-plots}, etc.

=== Launch

The `count` function summarized the data for a single variable in a new table. But the same information could be communicated as a picture! This is called data visualization, and Pyret has functions that can make displays for us!

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Turn to @printable-exercise{exploring-displays-alt.adoc}.
- Let's look at the first function together.
- What is the name of the function?
** _bar-chart_
- What is the Domain of the function?
** _Table, String_
- What is the Range of the function?
** _Image!_
- Take a minute and see if you and your partner can write an expression that will generate a `bar-chart` and give me a thumbs up when you have one building.
- Did `bar-chart` consume a categorical or quantitative column of data?
** _categorical_
- What does the resulting display tell us?
- Make a sketch of the display you just built in Pyret.
- Then work to complete the page, generating each of the other 3 displays. Some of them may be new to you - you are not expected to be an expert in them yet, but you should be able to figure out how to use the contract to get them building!
--

=== Synthesize

- Which displays worked with categorical data?
** _pie-chart & bar-chart_
- Why might you choose a bar chart over a pie chart or vice versa?
** `pie-chart` _only makes sense when you have the full picture, since it's representing the proportion of the whole_
** `bar-chart` _shows the count_
- How are bar charts and histograms different?
** `bar-chart` _summarizes @vocab{categorical} data. Each bar represents the count of a specific category._
** `histogram` _displays the distribution of @vocab{quantitative} data across the range._
