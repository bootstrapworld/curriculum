After each jump, Ninjacat lands at the bottom of the screen. It wouldn't be much fun if Ninjacat kept falling past the bottom of the screen and couldn't be seen anymore!

@n What changes as Ninjacat moves up and down? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_the y-coordinate_}}

*Use the new inequality functions to answer the following questions _with code_:*

@vspace{2ex}

@n Ninjacat is still visible on the bottom of the screen as long as…
@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(< y 490)) }}

@vspace{2ex}

@n Ninjacat hasn't gone off the top edge of the screen as long as…
@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(< y 490)) }}

@n Use the space below to draw Circles of Evaluation for these two expressions:

@span{.left }{@showsoln{(coe '(> y 0)) } }

@right{@showsoln{(coe '(< y 490)) } }
