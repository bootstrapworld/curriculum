@n What do you Notice about the program?

@n What do you Wonder?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you see when Sam is at (0,0)?  Why is that?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sam is at the center of the screen, because the origin is at the middle}}

@n What changes as the butterfly moves left and right?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Sam's x-coordinate_}}

Sam is in a 640 × 480 yard. Sam’s mom wants Sam to stay in sight. *How far to the left and right can Sam go and still remain visible?*

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sam can go to the left until their x-coordinate is less than -40, and to the right until x > 680}}

@fitb{}{}

Use the new inequality functions to answer the following questions _with code_:

@vspace{2ex}

@n Sam hasn't gone off the left edge of the screen as long as…
@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(> x -50)) } }

@vspace{2ex}

@n Sam hasn't gone off the right edge of the screen as long as…
@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(< x 690)) } }

@vspace{2ex}

@n Use the space below to draw Circles of Evaluation for these two expressions:

@left{ @showsoln{(coe '(> x -50)) } }

@right{@showsoln{(coe '(< x 690)) } }
