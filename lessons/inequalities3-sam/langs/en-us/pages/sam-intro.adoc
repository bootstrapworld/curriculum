Open the “Sam the Butterfly” starter file and press “Run”. __(Hi, Sam!)__

Move Sam around the screen using the arrow keys.

@n What do you notice about the program?

@n What do you wonder?

@vspace{6ex}

@n What do you see when Sam is at (0,0)?  Why is that?
@ifsoln{_Sam is at the center of the screen, because the origin is at the middle_}
@vspace{6ex}

@n What changes as the butterfly moves left and right?
@ifsoln{__Sam's x-coordinate__}

@vspace{4ex}

Sam is in a 640 × 480 yard. Sam’s mom wants Sam to stay in sight.

@vspace{2ex}

*How far to the left and right can Sam go and still remain visible?*
@ifsoln{Sam can go to the left until their x-coordinate is less than -40, and to the right until x > 680}

@vspace{2ex}

Use the new inequality functions to answer the following questions _with code_:

@vspace{2ex}

@n Sam hasn't gone off the left edge of the screen as long as…
@span{.right}{@fitb{30ex}{@showsoln{(sexp->code '(> x -50)) } } }

@vspace{2ex}

@n Sam hasn't gone off the right edge of the screen as long as…
@span{.right}{@fitb{30ex}{@showsoln{(sexp->code '(< x 690)) } } }

@vspace{2ex}

@n Use the space below to draw Circles of Evaluation for these two expressions:

@span{.left}{ @showsoln{(sexp->coe '(> x -50)) } }

@span{.right}{@showsoln{(sexp->coe '(< x 690)) } }
