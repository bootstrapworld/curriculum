== Computation as a Circle Transformation @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students transform a simple arithmetic expression to create as many equivalent Circles of Evaluation as they can. They then categorize these circles to consider different possible transformations and to identify _computation_ as a Circle Transformation.


=== Launch

Invite students to take a look at this Circle of Evaluation:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ 10 6))}
@clear

Explain that, to create an equivalent Circle of Evaluation, they could simply write this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(16))}
@clear

...or they could write this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ (+ 8 2) 6))}
@clear

Ensure that students recognize that expressions are equivalent when they simplify to the same value. Solicit a few other student ideas of equivalent Circles (@math{4  \times 4} or @math{15 + 1} or @math{16 \div 1}, etc) before delivering the following instructions:

[.lesson-instruction]
- On a piece of paper, you and your partner are going to create as many equivalent circles as you can!
- You may use any numbers and any operators.
- You may also use as many numbers, operators, and circles as you’d like! You have 3 minutes.

This activity both offers students an opportunity to practice building and constructing circles and invites them to explore the notion of a circle transformation.

As students discovered in the previous lesson, circles help us to see the underlying structure of mathematics. They are also, however, a useful tool to analyze how we can (and sometimes cannot) hope from one mathematical structure to another.


=== Investigate

Invite students to stand up and draw their contributions on the whiteboard in your classroom. Emphasize to students that the goal is to include as many unique circles as possible! (@math{10 + 6}, for instance, is not the same as @math{6 + 10} - even though they compute the same answer.)

Once there is a good assortment of circles on the board, invite students to take a look! What do they Notice? What do they Wonder?

//NOTICE & WONDER PEDAGOGY BOX//

After students have shared, explain the next element of the activity:

[.lesson-instruction]
- Let’s sort some of these circles into groups (of any size!).
- There is no right or wrong way to sort; in fact, you may choose to put one circle into multiple groups, and you may leave some circles ungrouped.
- You and your partner will record your groupings on a piece of paper. Come up with a name for each group so that someone else could identify what you think makes that group unique.
Who has a category for sorting circles that they see?

Work with students to identify one or two groupings as a class. If students are struggling to sort the circles, you might offer an example: _"I think I’m going to put @math{10 + 6} into a pair with @math{6 + 10} because they seem to have a lot in common... But I’m also going to put @math{10 + 6} and @math{6 + 10} into a group called single circles because they are both examples of expressions with exactly one circle."_

The subsequent lessons in this series introduce students to the Associative Property, the Commutative Property, the Identity Property, and the Distributive Property. Although students likely will not be familiar with these properties by name, it is quite likely that they will see them at play throughout the activity. Try to avoid naming properties today; instead, highlight students’ contributions and probe.

For instance, if a student observes that @math{2 \times 8} is the same as @math{8 \times 2}, you might inquire, “I wonder if that would work with division… is @math{2 \div 8} the same as @math{8 \div 2} ?”

In short: there are no wrong answers here! The goal is to help students develop a deep yet flexible understanding of the language of mathematics.



=== Synthesize

Have pairs share out their category names and make a class list. There is no need to evaluate categories’ names or qualify students’ observations; rather, challenge students to identify and articulate the patterns and transformations they have observed to lay a foundation upon which to formalize the laws of arithmetic.


== Diagramming Solving with Circles @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students use circles as a means to simplify arithmetic expressions down to one single value, making concrete the notion of computation as a circle transformation.

=== Launch

Because Circles of Evaluation help students visualize the structure of the math, they are a terrific solving tool. They create structure for students while simultaneously offering more flexibility than adhering to a strict sequential solving algorithm.

Take a look at this example of computation as a tool for solving:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(+ 3 (- 14 5)))} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(+ 3 9))} | &rarr; | @math{12}
|===


- What sort of transformation happened between the first circle and the second circle? The second and the final result?
** _The first transformation was the computation of @math{5} less than @math{14}. The second computation of @math{3} increased by @math{9}._

Now take a look at this example:


[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(+ (- 10 8) (* 3 6)))} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(+ 2 18))} | &rarr; | @math{20}
|===

- Does the order in which we transform the two inner circles (above) matter?  Why or why not?
** _No, the order does not matter! We could solve the circle on the left first, or the circle on the right._

=== Investigate


[.lesson-instruction]
- Use what you’ve learned about circles to complete Computation as a Circle Transformation.
- Optional: On Computation as a Circle Transformation - Challenge, fill in blanks that contain addends, factors, divisors, etc, rather than just solutions.


=== Synthesize

// Need some synthesize questions that will link the two sections of the lesson together and that maybe will also foreshadow things to come? //
