= Maya Gods

Archaeologists have determined that the Maya worshipped many gods, and that the five most important gods were associated with these symbols: corn, a pig being carried by someone, a skeleton, someone holding a snake, and a turtle carrying someone. But which is which? Study the images of each god and draw a line to match it to the symbol it represents.
