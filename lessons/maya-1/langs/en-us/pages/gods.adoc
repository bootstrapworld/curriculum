= Maya Gods

What does the writing on the stone carvings mean? Archaeologists have determined that the Maya worshipped many gods, and that the five most important gods were associated with these symbols: corn, a pig being carried by someone, a skeleton, someone holding a snake, and a turtle carrying someone. But which is which? Study the images of each god and draw a line to match it to the symbol it represents.
