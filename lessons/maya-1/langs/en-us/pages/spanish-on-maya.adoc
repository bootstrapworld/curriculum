= Portrayal of the Maya by the Spanish in the 1540s

_In 1549, a Franciscan friar named Diego de Landa was sent to the Yucatán, as part of Spain’s mission to convert the Maya to Catholicism. In the years to come, he tortured and killed countless Maya in his quest to locate and destroy their idols and temples. He also destroyed thousands of their hieroglyphic books (called codices), so that only three remain in the world today._

| “These people also make use of certain characters or letters, with which they wrote in their books their ancient matters and their sciences, and by these and by drawings and by certain signs in these drawings they understood their affairs and made others understand and taught them. We found a large number of these books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they regretted to an amazing degree and which caused them great affliction.”
| The Maya books were written with “figures and characters by which they could signify everything they desired; and that these great books are of such intelligence and subtle technique that we could say our writing does not offer much of an advantage.”

_The few codices not destroyed by the Spanish give us a glimpse at the wisdom and beauty of the ancient Maya culture. The Maya god of maize (corn) appeared in many of their writings and art. In fact, corn was so important to the Maya that humans are depicted as having been created from an ear of corn!_
