# Composing Functions 

For this activity we will be working in groups of 3-4 students.

Each group has a set of @link{pages/function-cards.html, "Function Cards"}, each of which takes an input and produces an output.

# Composing Functions

Each __function card__ has a Contract (Name, Domain, Range), and a description of what it does. 

Starting with 4, 
- you could play the `add 1` card to turn it into 5.
- you could play `add 6` and turn it into 10.

What other cards could you play to get from 4 to 10?

{layout="Launch"}
# Composing Functions

Select the cards you would play with to get from the starting number to the ending number. 
- Start at 4, end at 26
- Start at -22, end at 13
- Start at 64, end at 0

Let's try some more numbers from this @link{https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number, random integer generator}.

You will need to use some functions more than once, and that's ok! If you're ready for a challenge, try to find the _shortest path_ from start to end, using the smallest number of compositions.

# Diagramming Function Composition

Three of the function cards we just used were for the functions `f`, `g` and `h`:

* `f` multiplies its input by 3

* `g` adds six to its input

* `h` subtracts one from its input

We can compose those functions in any order. If we composed them as `f(g(h(x)))` and evaluated them for `x = 4` what would happen?

# Diagramming Function Composition

The circles of evaluation for @math{f(g(h(4)))} would look like this:

# Diagramming Function Composition

Do @math{f(g(h(x)))} and @math{g(h(f(x)))} evaluate to the same thing? {style="font-size:26pt"}

Why not? _order matters!_

# Composing Functions in Code 

- Log into @starter-file{editor}, and open a new program.
- Save the file as "Function Composition", and click "Run".
- Complete the following @printable-exercise{pages/function-composition-green-star.adoc}. When you're done, change the color of all the stars in the file to gold. 
- Then try @printable-exercise{pages/function-composition-your-name.adoc}.
- If you have time, work with @printable-exercise{pages/function-composition-scale-xy.adoc} and/or
@ifproglang{pyret}{@opt-online-exercise{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5fc946c8d135d036ef1edd01, Function Composition Matching Activity}
}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{@opt-online-exercise{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5fece8bb695f3d0d363c331b?collections=5fbecc2b40d7aa0d844956f0, Function Composition Matching Activity}
}

<!--
While students are exploring, be available for support but encourage student discussion to solve problems. Many student questions can be addressed with these responses:

Did you try drawing the Circle of Evaluation first? 
Did you check the contract? 
Have you pressed the Run button to save your Definitions changes?

Encourage students to practice writing comments in the code to describe what is being produced, using @ifproglang{wescheme}{`;`} @ifproglang{pyret}{`#`} at the beginning of the line.

# Composing Functions in Code

- What do all of these functions have in common?
- Does using one of these functions change the original image?
- What does the number in @show{(code 'scale)} represent?
- What does the number in @show{(code 'rotate)} represent?
- The Domain and Range for @show{(code 'flip-horizontal)} is `Image -> Image`.  Why can we use the output of the @show{(code 'text)} function as an _input_ for @show{(code 'flip-horizontal)}?

<!-- 
Fun with Images!
Now that students have learned how to use all of these image-composing functions, you may want to give them a chance to create a design of their own, tasking them with using at least 4 functions to create an image of their choosing.

Our @link{../flags/index.shtml, Flags lesson} also dives deeper into image composition.

# Composing Multiple Ways 

As is often true with solving math problems, there is more than one way to get the same composed image.

Suppose I wrote the code: 

@show{(code '(scale 3 (circle 50 "solid" "red")))}

Whatâ€™s another line of code I could write that would produce the exact same image?
    
<!-- 
	@show{(code '(circle 150 "solid" "red"))}

{layout="Investigate-DN"}
# Composing Multiple Ways 

Complete @printable-exercise{pages/more-than-one-way.adoc}.

There is a special function in @ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme} @ifproglang{pyret}{code.pyret.org (CPO)} that lets us test whether or not two images are equal.

@show{(code 'image=?)}` :: Image, Image -> Boolean`

Use it to test whether all of the expressions you wrote successfully build the same images.

---
{layout="Synthesize"}
# Composing Multiple Ways 

- Could we have written more expressions to create the same images?
- Are all of the ways to write the code equally efficient?
