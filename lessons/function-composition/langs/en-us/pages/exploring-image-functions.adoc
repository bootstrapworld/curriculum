By now you know how to make triangles in this programming language. Based on what you know about making triangles, can you figure out how to make stars? rectangles? ellipses? What other shapes might we be able to make? When you've discovered code to make a new shape, draw the Circle of Evaluation in the table below, along with a sketch of the shape. 

Mystery Functions: `text`, `regular-polygon`, `radial-star`

@vspace{1ex}

@n Use the space below to draw the Circles of Evaluation for the new functions and pictures of what the functions produce.

[cols="^.^24,^.^8,^.^8", options="header", stripes="none"]
