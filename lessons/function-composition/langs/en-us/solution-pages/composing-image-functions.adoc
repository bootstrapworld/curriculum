= Composing Image Functions

You’ll be investigating these functions with your partner:

@show{ (contracts
	"text" '("String" "Number" "String") "Image"
	"scale" '("Image") "Image"
	"rotate" '("Image") "Image"
	"flip-horizontal" '("Image") "Image"
	"flip-vertical" '("Image") "Image"
)}

1) Make an image of your name, in big purple letters. Draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the code that will create this image.

@vspace{3ex}

@showsoln{(sexp->coe '(text "Eric" 24 "purple"))}

@vspace{3ex}

@showsoln{(sexp->code '(text "Eric" 24 "purple"))}

@vspace{3ex}

2) Try using the `scale` function to make your name bigger or smaller. Draw the Circle of Evaluation (hint: use what you wrote above!), then write the code.

@vspace{3ex}

@showsoln{(sexp->coe '(scale 0.5 (text "Sophie" 24 "purple")))}

@vspace{3ex}

@showsoln{(sexp->code '(scale 0.5 (text "Sophie" 24 "purple")))}

@vspace{3ex}

3) In your own words, what does scale do?

@span{.blankline}{_When the number is less than 1, it scales the image down to a smaller version_}
@span{.blankline}{_When the number is greater than 1, it scales the image up to a larger version_}

@vspace{20ex}

4) Try out `rotate`, `flip-horizontal`, and `flip-vertical`. Use the space below to write your
code, then test out your code in WeScheme when you’re ready.

_For sample code for these functions, refer to the contracts page of the teachers manual._
