== `sqrt(16)`

@n How many arguments does `sqrt` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_1_}}

@n What type of argument does the expression expect? (Numbers? Strings? Booleans?) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Numbers._}}

@n What type of output does `sqrt` produce? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number._}}

@n What did the expression evaluate to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_4_}}


== `sqrt(x)`

@n Enter `sqrt(Weight)`. What do you observe?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's weight_}}

@n How about `sqrt(Legs)`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's legs for `sqrt(Legs)`._}}

What about `sqrt(Name)`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP produces an error message because it cannot find the square root of a string, only a number._}}

== `stringLength(x)`

@n How many arguments does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_1_}}

@n What type of argument does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_String_}}


@n What does the expression `stringLegnth("rainbow")` evaluate to? How come?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_7, which is how many letters are in the string "rainbow"_}}

@n What happens when you enter `stringLength(Name)`

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_7, CODAP finds the amount of letters in each animal's `Name` _}}

@n Does `stringLength` produce a Number? String? Boolean? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number_}}
