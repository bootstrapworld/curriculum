**“With great power comes great responsibility”**

During World War II, scientists were engaged in a race to develop new weapons, more powerful than anything the world had ever seen. 

While the immediate goal was "win the war", many of the scientists realized that the weapons they were developing could be used for all sorts of things _after the war was over_ - **and not all of them were good.**

**“With great power comes great responsibility”**

Josef Mengele was a Nazi who conducted horrible experiments on Jews at Auschwitz. 

Decades later, doctors in the US gave syphillis to unknowing African-American citizens as part of an experiment, and researchers at Stanford conducted an experiment in human behavior that went horribly wrong.{style="font-size:16pt"}

**Should doctors be bound by any ethical rules? If so, what rules?**{style="font-size:24pt"}

History is filled with examples of those who study science - be it medicine, human behavior, psychology, etc. - ignoring their ethical responsibility as humans.

# Case Studies

With tech companies hiring Data Scientists at a staggering rate and collecting massive datasets on users for those scientists to mine, there's **a new arms race** happening right now.{style="font-size:16pt"} 

Search engines tailor their results based on what they know about the customer doing the search, and social media networks want to recommend friends based on what they know about all of us.{style="font-size:16pt"} 

Both goals require building profiles on everyone, figuring out what their preferences are and where they tend to spend their time. They might require figuring out whether each of us is male or female, more likely to go to a movie or a play, or about to buy a dishwasher or a television.{style="font-size:16pt"}

# Case Studies

But these datasets and profiles could be used for far more than that. **What if the FBI used them to try and figure out who is likely to commit a crime, or a company tries to learn their employees' religion or sexual orientation?**

As they build ever-more sophisticated models based on ever-more accurate datasets, **Data Scientists need to think about the ethics of what they're doing** as well!
