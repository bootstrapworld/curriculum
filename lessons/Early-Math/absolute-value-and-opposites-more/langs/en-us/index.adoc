| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Students translate expressions with absolute value and opposite, using Circles, words and symbols.
* Students analyze equivalence in pairs of Circles with absolute value and equivalence.
* Students compute the result of expressions with absolute value and opposite.

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's use Circles of Evaluation to about opposites and absolute value in combination.

| Preparation
|
* This activity involves a card sort. The easiest way to prepare for this is to give each pair of students an envelope containing the three sets of cards. Keep each set together with rubber bands or paperclips.

== Translating Expressions @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students match Circles of Evaluation to expressions in words with absolute value and opposite, and then they consider how mathematical expressions correspond to those two representations.

=== Launch

Explain to students that they are going to receive @printable-exercise{three-sets-cards.adoc}.

The first set of cards includes Circles of Evaluation that feature `negate` and `abs`.

The second set of cards translates those expressions into words.

[.lesson-instruction]
- With your partner, match each Circle card with the corresponding Words card.
- Lay them out on the table in front of you so you can clearly see both the Circle and the Words.
- Some Circles have more than one translation into words.
- Discuss each match that you make.

Circulate as students sort their cards, ensuring that they are carefully analyzing each card so that they see the connection between the Circle of Evaluation and its translation into words. Students will need to consider if translating the Circle into words involves reading from the outside-in or the inside-out.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, you’re going to receive a third set of cards - Mathematical Expressions.
- One at a time, take turns analyzing each of these cards. After examining it closely, place it with the appropriate Circle / Words pairing.
- Explain to your partner how and why you placed each card.
- You and your partner must agree on each card’s placement before advancing to the next.

Again, circulate during the activity. As students match expressions in words to their arithmetic expressions and Circles, invite them to use the Circle as a tool to help them translate to the other representations.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Apply what you've learned by completing @printable-exercise{translating-abs-val-opp.adoc}.
- Each row on the worksheet represents a single arithmetic expression, written in three different forms. Sometimes, you will be provided with a Circle to translate, other times you will start with words or a mathematical expression.


=== Synthesize

Here are some key take-aways from this lesson:

- `negate` Circles can contain `abs` Circles

- `abs` Circles can contain `negate` Circles

- We can read the Circles outside-in or inside out when translating into words, depending on which translation we choose

- We can also translate our Circles and expressions in words into mathematical expressions.

Some questions for students to consider:

- We did lots of different translations between Circles, expressions in words, and mathematical expressions. Was there any type of translation that was more challenging for you?

- Can you think of any properties that we have not yet addressed during our work with absolute value and opposite?

** _We have not yet considered computation._



== Evaluating Expressions @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students tackle expressions that include both `abs` _and_ `negate`.

=== Launch

Circles can be extremely useful in helping students to navigate problems with `abs` and `negate`, which can be quite complicated, otherwise; after all, "negative" and "absolute value" are not typically delegated in the order of operations.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Analyze the equation below and consider if it is *true* or *false*:

@math{-|4| = |-4|}

Jenny says that it is _true_ because absolute value makes everything positive, so both sides of the equation evaluate to 4. Is she correct?
--

Representing the equation with Circles highlights the structure of these expressions and it becomes clearer that they are not equivalent.

| @show{(coe '(negate (abs 4)))} | @math{=} | @show{(coe '(abs (negate 4)))}
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc} to analyze additional pairs of Circles that use both `negate` and `abs`.

=== Investigate

Students who  can toggle between the mathematical representation, the expression in words, and the Circle of Evaluation will feel more confident both completing and discussing the subsequent activities.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On @printable-exercise{wodb-abs-val-negate.adoc}, identify each Circle that evaluates to the designated value.
- Next, try @printable-exercise{expression-to-circles-matching.adoc}


=== Synthesize

- The absolute value of a number is sometimes / always / never greater than or equal to the original number.
** _Always_
- The opposite of a number is sometimes / always / never equal to the original number.
** _Sometimes_
- The absolute value of a number is sometimes / always / never greater than or equal to the opposite of the number.
** _Always_
- The opposite of a number is sometimes / always / never equal to the absolute value of that number.
** _Never_
