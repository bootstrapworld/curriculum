<!--
- What number is the same distance from zero as @math{8}?
** _@math{-8}_
- What number is the same distance from zero as @math{-3}?
** _@math{3}_
- The pairs of numbers we've just identified are called @vocab{opposites} - two numbers that are the same distance from zero on the number line, with one negative and one positive.
- What are some other pairs of opposites that you can identify?
** _Possible responses: @math{6.5} and @math{-6.5}; @math{4} and @math{-4}; @math{\frac {7}{3}} and @math{- \frac {7}{3}}._
