| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Define absolute value as a number's distance from zero on the number line.
* Recognize that two numbers are referred to as "opposites" if they are the same distance from zero.
* Use Circles of Evaluation to analyze expressions with opposite and absolute value.

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's use Circles of Evaluation to think about opposites and absolute value.

| Preparation
|
* Draw or project a number line of the integers from -10 to 10. This will be the focal point of a lot of the conversation for today's lesson. 

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* The difference between absolute value and opposite can be subtle and confusing for students. Sometimes, given an input, they produce the same output - but at other times, their outputs differ.

== Finding Opposites @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students discover what it means for numbers to be @vocab{opposites}, and explore the impact of the `negate` in Circles of Evaluation.


=== Launch

Instruct students to draw a number line that spans from @math{-10} to @math{10}, or draw/project one at the front of the room.

[.lesson-instruction]
- What number is the same distance from zero as @math{8}?
** _@math{-8}_
- What number is the same distance from zero as @math{-3}?
** _@math{3}_
- The pairs of numbers we've just identified are called @vocab{opposites} - two numbers that are the same distance from zero on the number line, with one negative and one positive.
- What are some other pairs of opposites that you can identify?
** _Possible responses: @math{6.5} and @math{-6.5}; @math{4} and @math{-4}; @math{\frac {7}{3}} and @math{- \frac {7}{3}}._
- Are there any numbers on this line that don't have an opposite?
** _Students may guess that zero does not have an opposite - however zero is its own opposite!_

=== Investigate

Explain to students that the function used to represent "the opposite" is called `negate`. It can be used like any other operator that we put at the top of a Circle of Evaluation - with one important difference: when we use `negate`, we can include just one argument inside the Circle.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Take a look at the Circle below. What does it evaluate to?
** _The Circle below evaluates to @math{-2}._

[.image]
@show{(coe '(negate 2))}

- What happens if we nest a negating Circle _inside of_ another negating Circle?
** _The opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself._

[.image]
@show{(coe '(negate (negate 2)))}

- Practice applying `negate` on @printable-exercise{true-or-false-negate.adoc}. Evaluate each side of the @vocab{equation} to confirm if it is true or false.
- Explore Circles with @vocab{Variables}, and review previously explored properties (Identity, Commutative, Associative, and Distributive) on @printable-exercise{true-or-false-negate-2.adoc}.

When we want to show negation of a number or an expression, we just use a negative sign! So, while we can read @math{-45} by simply saying "negative 45," another way to read that value's name is by saying, "the opposite of 45."
Similarly, @math{-(x + m)} can be translated as "the opposite of the sum of @math{x} and @math{m}."

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note: Can we call it "minus 45"?!}
Precise language is crucial when dealing with this symbol: `-`.

In math we want students to read for _comprehension_, not just mechanically sounding out each symbol in order. We read the @vocab{arithmetic expression} @math{12 - 9} as "12 minus 9" __because subtraction is the "verb"__, not because the minus sign happens to be in the middle!

When we encounter a value such as @math{-20}, however, it is confusing and misleading to name that value "minus 5." Subtraction is not happening here - negation is! But if the teacher uses the "symbols in order" wording, it reinforces the lower level of reading comprehension for students.

=== Synthesize

- Two opposites are 8 units apart from each other. What are they?
** @math{4} and @math{-4}
- Two opposites are 42.5 units apart from each other. What are they?
** @math{21.5} and @math{-21.5}
- Cia says that opposites are always negative. Are they right? Why?
** _No, opposites are not always negative. When we negate a negative value, we get a positive value. Additionally, zero is its own opposite, and it is neither positive nor negative._

== Absolute Value @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students consider the meaning of @vocab{absolute value}, and apply the concept to Circles of Evaluation using `num-abs`.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
What is the distance between these two points on the number line: @math{-18} and @math{5}?

Give students a minute to contemplate, and then invite them to verbally share their strategies. Record students' thinking on the board, annotating the number line. All strategies are welcome, with a special interest in any discussion that hones in on the idea of _the distance of a number from zero._

Explain to students that we have a term for _the distance of a number from zero_ - it's @vocab{absolute value}.

We annotate absolute value like this: @math{|x|}, with @math{x} being any given number. When we encounter an expression like @math{|x|}, we say "the absolute value of @math{x}."

Because _opposites_ are the same distance away from zero, they will always have the same absolute value. So, @math{|4| = 4} and @math{|-4| = 4}.


=== Investigate

The function to represent absolute value is `num-abs`. It can be used like any other operator that we put at the top of a Circle of Evaluation - as with `negate`, when we use `num-abs`, we include just one argument inside the Circle.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Compare expressions with `num-abs` to expressions with `negate` on @printable-exercise{true-or-false-abs-val.adoc}.
- On the bottom half of the worksheet, determine whether variable equations featuring `negate` and `num-abs` are always, sometimes, or never true. Be sure to explain your response.
- Analyze Circles to determine @printable-exercise{wodb-abs-val-negate.adoc}. The worksheet starts with numeric values and then integrates variables. Place a check mark by each Circle that meets the condition stated on the left.

Check in with students to ensure that they have a solid understanding of absolute value before moving forward.

=== Synthesize

Think about the @vocab{algebraic expressions} @math{|h|} and @math{-h}.

- What do we know about the outcomes of each of these expressions?
** _@math{|h|} is always positive or zero, while @math{-h} can be negative, zero, or positive._

- When do they produce the same outcome?
** _@math{-h} is positive when @math{h} is negative, and @math{-h} is negative when @math{h} is positive. As a result, @math{|h|} and @math{-h} produce the same outcome only when @math{h} is negative or zero._

- When do they produce different outcomes?
** _@math{|h|} and @math{-h} produce different outcomes when @math{h} is positive._
