= Absolute Value and Opposite

*Opposites* are two numbers that are the same distance from zero on the number line, with one negative and one positive. For instance, @math{h} is the opposite of @math{-h}.

@vspace{1ex}

We can represent @math{-h} (read: “the opposite of h,” or “negative h”) with a Circle of Evaluation:

@vspace{1ex}

@center{@show{(coe '(negate h))}}

@vspace{1ex}

*Absolute value* is the (positive) distance of a number from zero. We annotate absolute value like this:  @math{|h|}, with @math{h} being any given number.

@vspace{1ex}

When we encounter an expression like @math{|h|}, we say "the absolute value of @math{h}."

@vspace{1ex}

We can represent @math{|h|} with a Circle of Evaluation:

@vspace{1ex}

@center{@show{(coe '(abs h))}}

@vspace{1ex}

Because _opposites_ are the same distance away from zero, they will always have the same absolute value. So, @math{|4| = 4} and @math{|-4| = 4}.

@vspace{1ex}

The algebraic expressions  @math{|h|} and @math{-h} sometimes produce the same outcome, and they sometimes produce different outcomes. @math{|h|} is always positive or zero, while @math{-h} can be negative, zero, or positive.

We can also create expressions that utilize both opposite and absolute value. For instance:

- We can find the @vocab{opposite} of an @vocab{absolute value}: @math{- | x |}

- We can find the @vocab{absolute value} of an @vocab{opposite}. @math{ |- x |}

Thinking about the structure of the expression (and studying its Circle of Evaluation) can help us understand if it is positive or negative.
