== Evaluating Expressions with Exponents and Variables

=== Overview

Students use Circles of Evaluation to parse and evaluate exponential expressions with variables.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Ms. Brenneman asked her class to evaluate @math{4m^2} for @math{m = 5}. Four students each produced a different Circle! Analyze them on Four Different Circles.

|===
| Jayla: @show{(coe  '(* 4 (num-expt m 2)))} | Keke: @show{(coe  '(* 4 (num-expt 2 m)))}
| Joe: @show{(coe  '(+ 4 (num-expt m 2)))} 	| Aaron: @show{(coe  '(num-expt (* 4 m) 2))}
|===
- Which Circle do you think matches the expression? If you're not sure, are there any that you can rule out right away?
** _Sample response: Jayla's Circle is correct. I know that Keke's response is incorrect because we cannot change the order of the base and the exponent. Joe's doesn't work because he added rather than finding a prodcut. Aaron squared @math{4m}, rather than just squaring @math{m}._
- Evaluate each Circle. Do any of them produce the same outcome? Why or why not?
** _Each Circle has a different result because they all have different structures; one even has a different operation. Jayla's Circle is 100; Keke's is 132; Joe's is 29; and Aaron's is 400._
--

Lead a discussion where students explain which Circle they chose and why. Ensure that students understand that - even with the inclusion of variables - we still apply the exponent _before_ applying other operations, as established in the previous lesson.

=== Common Misconceptions

Students who are new to expressions like @math{4m^2} may misinterpret them. Explain that this notation represents multiplication - not that the two digits are simply next to one another.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at the three-column table on Variable Expressions with Exponents.
- Either draw a Circle to match the expression, or write an expression to match the Circle.
- Once you have completely filled in the first and second column, move to the third column, where you will evaluate each expressions by substituting in the given value.

=== Synthesize

What was your strategy for evaluating expressions with variables and exponents?


== Computing Surface Area

=== Overview

Students apply Circles to analyze the formula for computing the surface area of a cube.
