# The Additive Inverse Property

We’ve learned that the Commutative and Associative Properties apply to addition... but not subtraction. What if there was a way to rewrite subtraction as addition? Then we could apply the Commutative and Associative Properties to subtraction expressions, too! Let’s explore this idea.

# The Additive Inverse Property

Let's play a game. 

I'm going to write a number in the left-hand column. You are going to tell me what value I should _add_ to that number, to get a sum of zero. I'll record your response in the right-hand column.

# The Additive Inverse Property

- The first number is @math{5}. What do I need to add to @math{5} to get @math{0}?
- The next number is @math{20}. What do I need to add to @math{20} to get @math{0}?
- How about @math{\frac{1}{2}}?
- How about @math{-45}?
- Can someone offer me another pair of numbers that add up to @math{0}?


<!--
- The first number is @math{5}. What do I need to add to @math{5} to get @math{0}?
** _@math{-5}. If this is students' first exposure to negative numbers, consider modeling a few examples._
- The next number is @math{20}. What do I need to add to @math{20} to get @math{0}?
- How about @math{\frac{1}{2}}?
- How about @math{-45}?
- Can someone offer me another pair of numbers that add up to @math{0}?
** _Allow a variety of students to share. Record responses on the table._

These number pairs all represent *opposites*.

The @vocab{Additive Inverse Property} tells us that adding a number and its opposite always produces zero.

# The Additive Inverse Property


- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/additive-inverse.adoc}.
- In the first section, determine the additive inverses and write them in the spaces provided.
- Then, fill in the missing number to complete the equations. Some equations use mathematical notation and some use Circles of Evaluation.

# The Additive Inverse Property

- Can you think of a way to visually represent that adding a number and its opposite always produces zero?
- How would you explain the concept of the Additive Inverse Property to another student?
- Looking forward: Can you predict what effect the Multiplicative Inverse Property might have?

# Addition and Subtraction: Inverse Operations

- Complete @printable-exercise{pages/discover-inverse.adoc}.
- When you're done, complete @printable-exercise{pages/discover-inverse-cont.adoc}.
- What did you observe about the additive inverse?


---
{layout="Launch"}
# Addition and Subtraction: Inverse Operations

- Subtraction is equivalent to adding the @vocab{opposite}.
- We can rewrite any subtraction expression as addition, and any addition expression as subtraction!

*We now can apply the Commutative and Associative Properties to a much broader set of expressions!*

Complete @printable-exercise{pages/wodb.adoc}.

What strategies did you use to determine equivalence?

<!--
To complete this worksheet, students do not need to be fluent at integer addition and subtraction. We just want students thinking about when expressions are @vocab{equivalent} based on what they have learned about the additive inverse.

# Addition and Subtraction: Inverse Operations


- Claire and Soraya want to write an equivalent expression for @math{22 - 30}. Claire studies the expression and announces that, because it involves subtraction, the Commutative Property cannot be applied. Is she correct?
- Soraya grabs a pencil and writes the following: @math{22 + -30}. She says, "There! I fixed it. Now we can apply the Commutative Property." Explain what Soraya did. Is she correct?
- Use the Additive Inverse Property to simplify this expression using mental computation: @math{3 + 96.8 - 42.74 - 96.8 + 7 - 3 + 42.74}

# The "Left-to-Right" Rule

- Consider this expression: @math{10 + 9 - 4}
- What do we get when we simplify it to a single value?
** _15_
- How did you arrive at your answer?

# The "Left-to-Right" Rule

Most students simplify the expression like this:

@show{(coe '(- (+ 10 9) 4))}


---
{layout="Launch"}
# The "Left-to-Right" Rule

*But is it essential to solve from left to right?*

What happens if we subtract before adding?

@show{(coe '(+ 10 (- 9 4)))}

{layout="Launch"}
# The "Left-to-Right" Rule

We’ve learned that the Associative Property applies for expressions with only addition... not addition _and_ subtraction. Many of us have also learned that when an expression includes addition and subtraction, we must work from left to right. *So… what’s going on!?* It appears that we get the same result regardless of how we simplify this expression.

# The "Left-to-Right" Rule

Does subtracting _first_ work every time? Can we rearrange the groupings of any expression with both addition and subtraction? Let's investigate.

- Turn to @printable-exercise{subtract-first-or-left-to-right.adoc}.
- There, you will test out the this algorithm on several different expressions to see if subtracting and then adding produces the correct result every time.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

---
{layout="Investigate"}
# The "Left-to-Right" Rule

- Why are we able to change the groupings for an expression like @math{10 + 9 - 4} ... but _not_ for an expression like @math{10 - 9 - 4}?
- Describe why the this "subtraction first" algorithm works. (Hint: Think about the @vocab{Additive Inverse Property}!)

<!--
Encourage students to think deeply about why this algorithm works – and if you’d like, invite them to consider and discuss why students all across the country are typically taught just one algorithm when, typically, there are an abundance to choose from!

# The "Left-to-Right" Rule

Now, let's put our new knowledge to use! Project the problems below one at a time, and invite students to solve using mental math.

Scan each problem on the next to identify any additive inverses, then solve using mental computation.

 @math{4 + 5 + 97 - 4 + 3}
 @math{9 + 17 + 41 - 17}
 @math{67 - 104 + 937 - 67 + 104}

<!--
- @math{4 + 5 + 97 - 4 + 3}
** _Solution: @math{105}_

- @math{9 + 17 + 41 - 17}
** _Solution: @math{50}_

- @math{67 - 104 + 937 - 67 + 104}
** _Solution: @math{937}_

- How did it feel to scan the problem, find any additive inverses, and then solve mentally?
- Did you like this new approach, or do you prefer solving left to right?
- How would you explain to another student why they do _not_ always need to solve from left to right when evaluating expressions with addition and subtraction.
- What are some advantages of solving left to right? What are some disadvantages?
