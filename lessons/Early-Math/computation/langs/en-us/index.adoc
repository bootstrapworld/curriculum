== Equivalence and Computation @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students play with a simple arithmetic expression to create as many equivalent Circles of Evaluation as they can. They then categorize these Circles to consider equivalence relations and to identify _Computation_ as one way to assess equivalence.


=== Launch

Invite students to take a look at this Circle of Evaluation:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ 10 6))}

Explain that, to create an @vocab{equivalent} Circle of Evaluation, they could write this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ (+ 8 2) 6))}

Because students know that the computation @math{8 + 2} produces 10, they can decompose 10 accordingly to produce a different equivalent Circle.

Or they could simply write @math{16}!

In this last example, the Circle has been simplified down to just one number; because we can't have Circles without functions, the Circle disappears.

[.lesson-point]
Numeric expressions are equivalent when they simplify to the same value.

Solicit a few other student ideas of equivalent Circles (for instance: @math{4  \times 4} or @math{15 + 1} or @math{16 \div 1}) before delivering the following instructions:

[.lesson-instruction]
- On a piece of paper, you and your partner are going to create as many equivalent Circles for @math{10 + 6} as you can!
- You may use any numbers and any operators.
- You may also use as many numbers, operators, and Circles as you’d like! You have 5 minutes.

This activity both offers students an opportunity to practice building and constructing Circles and invites them to explore the notion of equivalence.

As students discovered in the previous lesson, Circles help us to see the underlying structure of mathematics. They are also, however, a useful tool to analyze how we can move from one mathematical structure to another without changing the value of the expression.


=== Investigate

Invite students to stand up and draw their contributions on the whiteboard in your classroom. Emphasize to students that the goal is to include as many unique Circles as possible! (@math{10 + 6}, for instance, is not exactly the same as @math{6 + 10} - even though they both produce 16.)

Once there is a good assortment of Circles on the board, invite students to take a look! What do they Notice? What do they Wonder?

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note: Notice and Wonder!}

This pedagogy is a @link{https://www.nctm.org/noticeandwonder/, widely-used best practice in Math-Ed}, and is used throughout this course. In the "Notice" phase, students are asked to crowd-source their observations. No observation is too small or too silly! By listening to other students' observations, students may find themselves taking a closer look. The "Wonder" phase involves students raising questions, but they must also explain the context for those questions. Sharon Hessney (moderator for the NYTimes excellent @link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's going on in this Graph?} activity) sometimes calls this "what do you wonder...and *why*?". Both of these phases should be done in groups or as a whole class, with adequate time given to each.
|===

After students have shared, explain the next element of the activity:

[.lesson-instruction]
- Let’s sort some of these Circles into groups (of any size!).
- There is no right or wrong way to sort; in fact, you may choose to put one Circle into multiple groups, and you may leave some Circles ungrouped.
- You and your partner will record your groupings on a piece of paper. Come up with a name for each group so that someone else could identify what you think makes that group unique.
Who has a category for sorting Circles that they see?

Work with students to identify one or two groupings as a class. If students are struggling to sort the Circles, you might offer an example:

- I'm putting @math{10 + 6} into a pair with @math{6 + 10} because they both include 10 and 6.

- I’m also going to put @math{10 + 6} and @math{6 + 10} into a group called single Circles because they are both examples of expressions with exactly one Circle (no nesting).

Subsequent lessons in this series introduce students to the Associative Property, the Commutative Property, the Identity Property, and the Distributive Property. Although students they may not know these properties by name, students will see them at play throughout the activity. There is no need to name properties today; instead, highlight students’ contributions and probe.

For instance, if a student observes that @math{2 \times 8} is the same as @math{8 \times 2}, you might inquire whether the equivalence holds if we use division rather than multiplication.

In short: there are no wrong answers here! The goal is to help students develop a deep yet flexible understanding of the language of mathematics.



=== Synthesize

Have pairs share out their category names and make a class list. There is no need to evaluate categories’ names or qualify students’ observations; rather, challenge students to identify and articulate the patterns they have observed to lay a foundation upon which to formalize the laws of arithmetic.


== Simplifying with Circles @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students use Circles to simplify arithmetic expressions down to one single value.

=== Launch

Because Circles of Evaluation help students visualize the structure of the math, they are a terrific solving tool. They create structure for students while simultaneously offering more flexibility than adhering to a strict sequential solving algorithm.

Take a look at this example of computation as a tool for solving:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(+ 3 (- 14 5)))} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(+ 3 9))} | &rarr; | @math{12}
|===


- Why is the first Circle equivalent to the second Circle? The second Circle and the final result?
** _To get from the the first Circle to the next: @math{5} less than @math{14} becomes 9. To get from the second Circle to the final result, @math{3} increased by @math{9} is @math{12}._

Now take a look at this example:


[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(+ (- 10 8) (* 3 6)))} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(+ 2 18))} | &rarr; | @math{20}
|===

- Does the order in which we evaluate the two inner Circles (above) matter?  Why or why not?
** _No, the order does not matter! We could solve the Circle on the left first, or the Circle on the right. The Circles are independent of one another._

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note: A Flexible Order of Operations?}

__Think for a moment about a commonly heard statement in teaching the order of operations: “You work from left to right.” At another point in the curriculum, when working on properties of the operations, we say, “You can add numbers in any order” (commutative property). How can both of these statements be true? Preparing students to *do mathematics* means that they have an integrated understanding of rules and properties in mathematics.__

- From @link{https://thinking101canada.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/order-of-operations-the-myth-and-the-math.pdf, "Order of Operations: The Myth and the Math"}

To recap: *yes*, we are advocating for a flexible order of operations that relies on students' abilities to make sense the underlying structure of math!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Use what you’ve learned about Circles to complete @printable-exercise{circles-and-computation.adoc}.
- Did you fill in blanks in the Circles from left to right or right to left? Why?


=== Synthesize

Need some synthesize questions that will link the two sections of the lesson together and that maybe will also foreshadow things to come?

== Are They Equivalent? @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students demonstrate their understanding of computation as a way of illustrating equivalence through two different games - "True or False?" and "Which One Doesn't Belong?"

=== Launch

Explain to students that they are about to learn to play two different games, which they will revisit periodically throughout this course. The first is "True or False?"

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note: Viewing the Equal Sign as Relational}
These activities are designed to help students develop a _relational view_ of the equal sign. Students often interpret the equal sign _operationally_, or they think of it as an instruction that means "now get the answer." Students with an operational view of the equal sign often solve solve 8 + 4 = ? + 5 incorrectly, as either 12 or 17.

Conversely, students who have a relational view of the equal sign recognize that a relationship exists between the numbers or expressions on either side of the equal sign. Decades of @link{https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02655897.pdf, "research"} suggest that students who interpret the equal sign to mean "the same as" are better positioned to think algebraically down the road.
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- Let's play a round of "True or False?"
- Look at these two Circles. Use computation (or any other strategy) to determine if the statement of equivalence is true or false.
- Now try it on your own on @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}.

The Circles in this activity were designed to support students in practicing various strategies for adding. If students can recognize structure and avoid computation, that's fine too!

=== Investigate

The second game, "Which One Doesn't Belong," has students analyze four different Circles to determine which Circle is not equivalent. Model your thought process before inviting students to work.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{wodb.adoc}.
