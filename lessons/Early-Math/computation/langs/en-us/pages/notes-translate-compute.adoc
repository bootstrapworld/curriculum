= Translation and Computation

== Translation

Circles of Evaluation help us visualize the structure of mathematical expressions.

- Every Circle of Evaluation must have one - and only one! - operator (or function!) written at the top.

- The inputs of the operator are written left to right, in the middle of the Circle.

- Circles of Evaluation can contain other Circles of Evaluation.

We can translate any arithmetic expression into a Circle of Evaluation or a verbal expression. Below, we've translated the arithmetic expression @math{5+3} into a Circle of Evaluation and then a Verbal Expression.

| @math{5+3} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(+ 5 3))} | &rarr; | the sum of 5 and 3

Math is precise, but that precision is difficult to preserve when we switch to words. Often, sentences can be ambiguous, meaning that there is more than one way to interpret them! One reason that Circles of Evaluation are so powerful is that they eliminate the ambiguity we encounter when representing expressions with words.

== Computation

Arithmetic expressions are *equivalent* when they simplify to the same value.  Here is an illustration (with Circles of Evaluation) that can help us visualize simplifying a more complex expression into a single numeric value.

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none", frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(+ 3 (- 14 5)))} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(+ 3 9))} | &rarr; | @math{12}
|===

Computation is one tool (of many!) that can allow us to determine if two expressions are equivalent.
