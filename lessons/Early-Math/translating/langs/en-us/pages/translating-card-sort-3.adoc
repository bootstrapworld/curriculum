*Teachers*: To prepare for this activity, cut out the cards below and keep each set (of three) together with a rubber band or paperclip. For this activity, you will also cut cards from @opt-printable-exercise{translating-card-sort-2.adoc} and @opt-printable-exercise{translating-card-sort-3.adoc}; we recommend printing each set in a different color. __Note that this page includes three copies of the same set. You will need one set for every pair of students.__
