| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Model an arithmetic expression using Circles of Evaluation.
* Translate between verbal expressions, Circles of Evaluation, and mathematical expressions.
* Recognize when expressions in words are ambiguous.


| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's analyze the structure of verbal expressions using Circles of Evaluation.

| Preparation
|
* This activity involves a card sort. The easiest way to prepare for the card sort is to give each pair of students an envelope containing the three sets of cards. Keep each set (Expressions, Circles of Evaluation, and Verbal Expressions) together with rubber bands or paperclips.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* This lesson may challenge students' ideas of math as a subject that is entirely black and white. This theme - that there are oftentimes a variety of completely valid ways of seeing a seemingly simple problem - will emerge again.

== Circles of Evaluation @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students match Circles of Evaluation to @vocab{arithmetic expressions}, and then they consider how those arithmetic expressions in words map onto Circles of Evaluation.

=== Launch

Give each pair of students an envelope and explain that it contains @handout{pages/three-sets-cards.adoc, "three sets of cards"}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look through the first set of cards. What do you notice?
** _Students should notice that the first set of cards includes @vocab{arithmetic expressions}. The expressions on these cards each include the number 15, the number 3, and an @vocab{operator}. Note that because these are expressions - not @vocab{equations} - they do not include an equal sign._
- Now, look through the second set of cards. What do you notice?
** _Students should observe that each card includes a an oval-shaped diagram. They may also notice the position of the numbers and operator within that diagram._

This second set of cards includes Circles of Evaluation. A @vocab{Circle of Evaluation} helps students visualize the structure of the mathematical expressions they encounter. For the time being, here’s what students need to know about them:

- Every Circle must have one - and only one! - operator (or @vocab{function}!), written at the top.

- The inputs of the operator are written left to right, in the middle of the Circle.

Share these two key concepts before explaining the following instructions.

[.lesson-instruction]
- With your partner, match each Arithmetic Expression card with the corresponding Circle of Evaluation card. Do not sort the Verbal Expression cards yet.
- There are more Circles of Evaluation than expressions. Create a separate pile for any cards that do not have a match.
- Lay the cards out on the table in front of you so you can clearly see both the Circle of Evaluation and the expression.
- Discuss any questions that arose.

Circulate as students sort their cards, ensuring that they are carefully analyzing each card so that they see the connection between the arithmetic expression and the Circle of Evaluation. This first phase of matching cards should be relatively quick - but it might raise questions on a few topics:

- *Symbols*. Circles of Evaluation utilize `*` to represent multiplication and `/` to represent division. (Why? Circles of Evaluation are a bridge representation - one which can eventually be used to help students learn to code! These are also the symbols used to type mathematical expressions into a search bar! _Although we use these symbols on all of our materials, you and your students can use whichever operator symbols are most comfortable._)

- *Order of terms*. While @math{5 + 3} and @math{3 + 5} both evaluate to the same _answer_, they are not the same _expression_. Highlight this difference for students.

- *Position of the operator*. The operator always belongs at the top of the Circle, and not in between terms. Explain to students that this is a convention we must follow when working with Circles of Evaluation.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, you’re going to receive a set of cards with verbal expressions - expressions written out in _words_.
- One at a time, take turns reading each card from the Verbal Expressions set out loud. After reading the card, place it with the corresponding Circle of Evaluation and Expression cards. Some sets will include just 3 cards, and others will have more.
- Explain to your partner how and why you placed each card.
- You and your partner must agree on each card’s placement before advancing to the next.

Again, circulate during the activity. As students match Verbal Expressions to their Arithmetic Expressions and Circles of Evaluation, additional challenges may arise. In particular:

- *One-third of 15*. This card will likely motivate some discussion. Take advantage of opportunities to help students connect multiplication and division as inverse operations. Explain to students that another way to represent this expression is @math{\frac{1}{3} \times 15}. Dividing by 3 produces the same outcome as multiplying by @math{\frac{1}{3}}.
- *Translating subtraction.* Students often translate "3 less than 15" into @math{3 - 15}, rather than @math{15 - 3}. Discuss the meaning of the word "less" in this context. Sometimes, asking, “What value is 3 less than 15?” can help students to make the connection. (The word "than" tends to force the numbers to appear in the _opposite_ order in which the language arranges them.)

If students have already been introduced to inequality statements (e.g., 3 < 5), there is often another point of confusion:

- "is less than" is a comparison statement (3 < 5)
- "less than" without the "is" indicates subtraction
- "is" translates to equals, or accompanies a statement of inequality

Reading expressions aloud can often help students think about the meaning of the words.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{practice-translating.adoc}. Each row of the table represents a single arithmetic expression, written in three different ways. Fill in the empty spaces so that all three representations match.
- Next, complete @printable-exercise{matching-words-to-circles.adoc}.

Ensure that students are confident creating and analyzing simple Circles, as the next section of the lesson introduces another layer of complexity.

=== Investigate

During the launch, students looked at the Circle of Evaluation for "15 increased by 3."

Let’s say we want to replace @math{15} with @math{3 \times 5}. Now, our expression looks like this: @math{3 \times 5 + 3}.

Translating this mathematical expression into words requires students to see the underlying structure of the expression (e.g. - Multiply @math{3} by @math{5} first? Or add @math{5} and @math{3}?). Then, they must access (possibly new/unfamiliar) vocabulary to describe what they see. Finally, they need to fit the right vocabulary onto the structure in the right way.

Fortunately, there is a simpler way...

[.lesson-point]
Circles of Evaluation can contain other Circles of Evaluation.

The Circle of Evaluation for @math{3 \times 5 + 3} looks like this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ (* 3 5) 3))}

Because Circles of Evaluation highlight the structure of any given expression, translating into words is a far less daunting task: the inner Circle clearly shows a product, which is being increased by @math{3} (as the outer Circle indicates).

The following activities allow students an opportunity to apply this new information.

[.lesson-instruction]
- First, practice @printable-exercise{translate-words-to-circles.adoc}.
- Then, translate in the __other__ direction on @printable-exercise{translate-circles-to-words.adoc}.
** _Note: There are multiple correct translations! Invite students to share their responses and evaluate the clarity of each translation as a class._
- When you’re finished, complete @printable-exercise{translation-table1.adoc} and @printable-exercise{translation-table2.adoc, "Part 2"} to practice moving between all three representations (the mathematical expression, the Circle of Evaluation, the verbal expression).
** _Note: In Part 1, the same nested Circle is used in multiple expressions - but not all expressions! In Part 2, the structure of the Circles of Evaluation shift from expression to expression._
- Optional: Try @opt-printable-exercise{matching-math-to-words.adoc}, where you will match mathematical expressions with their corresponding expressions in words. (If you get stuck, feel free to draw Circles to help you.)

Be sure to spend a moment going over students' solutions. Some translations into words are clearer than others; the subsequent section of this lesson will explore that notion in greater depth.

=== Synthesize
- We did lots of different translations between Circles of Evaluation, verbal expressions, and arithmetic expressions.
- Was there any type of translation that was more challenging for you?
- Is there more than one way to draw the Circle of Evaluation for @math{1 + 2} ? If so, is one way more "correct" than the other?



== The Ambiguity of Words @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students diagram arithmetic expressions using Circles of Evaluations to consider how different mathematical interpretations can lead to different outcomes.


=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Take a look at this sentence: "My heroes are my grandparents, Batman and Wonder Woman."
- How do you interpret the sentence?
** _If students do not giggle at the suggestion that your grandparents are superheroes, try re-reading the sentence with different inflections - or invite a student to do so. Discuss the two different possible interpretations of the sentence._

Math is precise, but that precision is difficult to preserve when we switch to words. Often, sentences can be _ambiguous_, meaning that there is more than one way to interpret them!

One reason that Circles of Evaluation are so powerful is that they eliminate the ambiguity we encounter when representing expressions with words.  They also delineate expressions more clearly than traditional mathematical notation. In this lesson, we tackle verbal expressions that have _more than one_ possible mathematical translation.

=== Investigate

Take a look at this expression: "the sum of three and two multiplied by eight"

Are we multiplying first and then adding (as represented by the Circle on the left), or adding first and then multiplying (as represented by the Circle on the right)?

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===

|@show{(coe  '(+ 3 (* 2 8)))}		| @show{(coe  '(* (+ 3 2) 8))}
|===

In this case, there are multiple ways to translate the sentence. (Would inserting a comma after the word “two” provides clarity?)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{ambiguity-of-words.adoc}, drawing two possible Circles for each verbal expression.
- What happens when you translate each Circle into a mathematical expression? Do the expressions produce the same result?
** _The expressions are structurally different, and generally produce different results (with two noteworthy exceptions!)_
- Did you notice anything interesting about the last two expressions, compared to the others on the page?
** _These expressions use only multiplication or only addition. As a result, the two expressions you wrote evaluated to the same outcome._

We don't want students to think _all_ mathematical expressions in words are ambiguous, as that is simply not the case! Emphasize that only certain verbal structures create this confusion; some phrases are indeed clearer than others. The following activity emphasizes this idea.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On @printable-exercise{ambiguous-or-clear.adoc}, identify the expressions that have two different numeric translations.
- When you encounter an expression that is ambiguous, rewrite it two times - once for each possible interpretation.
- When you encounter an expression that is clear, draw its Circle of Evaluation.

=== Synthesize

- Why are some expressions in words ambiguous and others are not?
- Do you think that expressions written in the language of math have ambiguity?
- Are Circles of Evaluation ever ambiguous?
