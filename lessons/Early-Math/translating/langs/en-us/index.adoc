| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Model an arithmetic expression using @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.
* Translate between expressions in words, Circles of Evaluation, and mathematical expressions.
* Recognize when expressions in words are ambiguous.


| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's use Circles of Evaluation to analyze the structure of expressions in words and numbers.

| Preparation
|
* This activity involves a card sort. The easiest way to prepare for this is to give each pair of students an envelope containing the three sets of cards. Keep each set (Expressions, Circles of Evaluation, and Words) together with rubber bands or paperclips.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* This lesson may challenge students' ideas of math as a subject that is entirely black and white. This theme - that there are oftentimes a variety of completely valid ways of seeing a seemingly simple problem - will emerge again.

== Circles of Evaluation @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students match Circles of Evaluation to mathematical expressions, and then they consider how mathematical expressions in words map onto Circles of Evaluation.

=== Launch

Explain to students that they are going to receive @handout{pages/three-sets-cards.adoc, "three sets of cards"}.

The first set of cards includes @vocab{mathematical expressions}. The expressions on their cards each include the number 15, the number 3, and an operator (+, -, *, or /). Note that because these are expressions - not equations - they do not include an equal sign.

The second set of cards includes @vocab{_Circles of Evaluation_}. Broadly, Circles of Evaluation will help students to visualize the structure of the mathematical expressions they encounter. For the time being, here’s what students need to know about Circles of Evaluation:

- Every Circle must have one - and only one! - function, written at the top.

- The inputs of the function are written left to right, in the middle of the Circle.

Share these two key concepts before explaining the following instructions.

[.lesson-instruction]
- With your partner, match each Expression card card with the corresponding Circle card.
- There are more Circles than expressions. Create a separate pile for any cards that do not have a match. You may also match more than one Circle with a single expression.
- Lay the cards out on the table in front of you so you can clearly see both the Circle and the expression. Create a separate pile for any cards that do not have a match.
- Discuss each match that you make.

Circulate as students sort their cards, ensuring that they are carefully analyzing each card so that they see the connection between the arithmetic expression and the Circle of evaluation. This first phase of matching cards should be relatively quick - but it might raise questions on a few topics:

- *Symbols*. Circles utilize * to represent multiplication and / to represent division. (Why? Circles are a bridge representation - one which can eventually be used to help students learn to code! Although we use these symbols on all of our materials, you and your students can use whichever operator symbols are most comfortable.)

- *Order of terms*. Although 5 + 3 and 3 + 5 both evaluate to 8, each of these are unique expressions.

- *Position of the operator*. The operator always belongs at the top of the Circle, and not in between terms.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, you’re going to receive a set of cards with expressions in _words_.
- One at a time, take turns reading each Words card out loud. After reading the card, place it with the appropriate Circle and expression. Some sets will include just 3 cards, and others will have more.
- Explain to your partner how and why you placed each card.
- You and your partner must agree on each card’s placement before advancing to the next.

Again, circulate during the activity. As students match expressions in words to their arithmetic expressions and Circles, additional challenges may arise.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{practice-translating.adoc}. Each row of the table represents a single arithmetic expression, written in three different forms. Fill in the empty spaces so that all three forms represent the same expression.
- Next, complete @printable-exercise{matching-words-to-circles.adoc}.

Ensure that students are confident creating and analyzing simple Circles, as the next section introduces another layer of complexity.

=== Investigate

During the launch, students looked at the Circle for "15 increased by 3."

Let’s say we want to replace @math{15} with @math{3 \times 5}. Now, our expression looks like this: @math{3 \times 5 + 3}.

Translating this mathematical expression into words requires students to complete a number of tasks concurrently.

- First, they must see some sort of structure in expression. (Multiply @math{3} by @math{5} first? Or add @math{5} and @math{3}?)

- Now, they must hold that structure in their heads as they attempt to access (possibly new? possibly unfamiliar?) vocabulary.

- They must map said vocabulary onto the imaginary structure that has quite possibly slipped away by this point.

Fortunately, there is an simpler way...

[.lesson-point]
Circles of Evaluation can contain other Circles!

The Circle of Evaluation for @math{3 \times 5 + 3} looks like this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ (* 3 5) 3))}

Because the Circles of Evaluation highlight the structure of any given expression, translating into words is a far less daunting task: the inner Circle very clearly shows a product, which is being increased by @math{3} (as the outer Circle indicates).

[.lesson-instruction]
- First, practice @printable-exercise{translate-words-to-circles.adoc}.
- Then, translate in the __other__ direction on @printable-exercise{translate-circles-to-words.adoc}.
- When you’re finished, complete @printable-exercise{translation-table1.adoc} and @printable-exercise{translation-table2.adoc, "Part 2"} to practice moving between all three representations (the mathematical expression, the Circle of Evaluation, the expression in words).
- Optional: Try @opt-printable-exercise{matching-math-to-words.adoc}, where you will match mathematical expressions with their corresponding expressions in words. (If you get stuck, feel free to draw your own!)

Be sure to spend a moment going over students' solutions. Some translations into words are clearer than others; the subsequent section of this lesson will explore that notion in greater depth.

=== Common Misconceptions

- Students often translate "3 less than 15" into @math{3 - 15}, rather than @math{15 - 3}. Discuss the meaning of the word "less" in this context. Sometimes, asking, “What value is 3 less than 15?” can help students to make the connection.

- Difficulty may arise when matching words to the division expression, 15/3. Take advantage of every opportunity to help students connect multiplication and division as inverse operations.


=== Synthesize
- We did lots of different translations between Circles, words, and arithmetic expressions.
- Was there any type of translation that was more challenging for you?
- Is there more than one to draw the Circle for @math{1 + 2} ? If so, is one way more "correct" than the other?



== The Ambiguity of Words @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students diagram expressions using Circles of Evaluations to consider how different mathematical interpretations can lead to different outcomes.


=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Take a look at this sentence: "My heroes are my grandparents, Batman and Wonder Woman."
- How do you interpret the sentence?
** _If students do not giggle at the suggestion that your grandparents are superheroes, try re-reading the sentence with different inflections - or invite a student to do so. Discuss the two different possible interpretations of the sentence._

We open with this silly sentence not to spark a debate about Oxford commas, but to highlight how ambiguity enters the picture when we attempt to express ideas in words.

One reason that Circles of Evaluation are so powerful is that they eliminate the ambiguity we often encounter when representing expressions with words.  They also delineate expressions more clearly than traditional mathematical notation. In this lesson, we tackle expressions in words that have _more than one_ possible mathematical translation.

=== Investigate

Take a look at this expression: "the sum of three and two multiplied by eight"

Are we multiplying first and then adding (as represented by the Circle on the left), or adding first and then multiplying (as represented by the Circle on the right)?

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]

|===

Words can be confusing! In this case, there are multiple translations that work. (And it’s debatable whether inserting a comma after the word “two” provides clarity.)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{ambiguity-of-words.adoc}, drawing two possible Circles for each expression in words.
- What happens when you translate each Circle into a mathematical expression? Do the expressions appear to produce the same result?
** _The expressions are structurally different, and generally produce different results (with two exceptions!)_
- Did you notice anything interesting about the last two expressions, compared to the others on the page?
** _These expressions use only multiplication or only addition. As a result, they are equivalent - meaning that they evaluate to the same result regardless of which Circle we use._

We don't want students to think _all_ mathematical expressions in words are ambiguous, as that is simply not the case! Emphasize that only certain verbal structures create this confusion; some phrases are indeed clearer than others. The following activity emphasizes this idea.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On @printable-exercise{ambiguous-or-clear.adoc}, identify the expressions that have two different numeric translations.
- When you encounter an expression that is ambiguous, rewrite it two times - once for each possible interpretation.
- When you encounter an expression that is clear, draw its Circle of Evaluation.

=== Synthesize

- Why are some expressions in words ambiguous and others are not?
- Do you think that expressions written in the language of math have ambiguity?
- What is it about Circles of Evaluation that removes ambiguity?
