| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Circles of Evaluation will not help students to visualize or understand the meaning of exponents as repeated multiplication. Rather, they will help students parse expressions that involve exponents. We recommend ensuring that students are comfortable evaluating exponents before jumping into this lesson.

== Expressions with Exponents and One Operation @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Sudents use Circles, words, and mathematical notation to analyze the structure of expressions with exponents and one operation.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Show students the following expression: @math{2^3}
- One way of reading this expression is "two raised to the power of three." Do you know any other ways of reading this expression with an exponent?
** _Two to the third power; two to the third; two cubed._
- What does it mean to _cube_ a number?
** We multiply it by itself three times.
- What does this expression evaluate to?
** @math{2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8}

Clarify and reinforce some key concepts about exponents via class discussion:

- The number on the left is called the _base_; that number is multiplied by itself when we apply the exponent.

- The number next to the base is called the _exponent_; it indicates how many times to multiply the base.

- "Cubing" is the same as "raising to the third power", and "squaring" is the same as raising to the second power.

- There is no special terminology for any other exponents. (The subsequent lesson will address why two and three are referred to as "squaring" and "cubing.")

Explain to students that we can represent expressions with exponents as Circles of Evaluation. The function we use to do so is called `num-expt`; when we use `num-expt`, the value on the left is the _base_, and the value on the right is the exponent.

Exponents are valuable because they act as a shorthand. The Circle of Evaluation for @math{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2} looks like this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(* (* (* (* 2 2) 2) 2) 2))}

But the Circle of Evaluation for @math{2^5} is much easier to interpret.

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(num-expt 2 5))}

Now, have students analyze the two Circles below.

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@math{5^2}							| @math{2^5}
|@show{(coe  '(num-expt 5 2))}		| @show{(coe  '(num-expt 2 5))}
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- Is it true or false that these expressions are equivalent?
** _It is false; the first Circle evaluates to 25, while the second Circle evaluates to 32. We cannot switch the order of the exponent and the base, as we could when adding or multiplying values._

With these basics mastered, students are ready to discover how Circles can help them in analyzing more complicated exponential expressions - including expressions with negations and additional operations.

=== Investigate

Invite students to examine the two Circles below:

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===

|@show{(coe  '(* 9 (num-expt 3 2)))}		| @show{(coe  '(num-expt (* 9 3) 2))}
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- How would you translate each of these Circles into words? Why are their translations different?
** _The Circle on the left is "nine multiplied by three squared," while the Circle on the right is "find the product of nine and three, then square it." Their translations differ because the Circles are organized differently._
- How would you translate each of these Circles into mathematical expressions?
** The Circle on the left is @math{9 \times 3^2} while the Circle on the right is @math{(9 \times 3)^2}.

Students will likely suggest @math{9 \times (3^2)} as a translation for the Circle on the right. This response is correct - but it is valuable for students to recognize that expressions with exponents are often written _without_ the parentheses. That said, students will always draw the base and the exponent inside of their own Circle.

[.lesson-point]
In an expression with no grouping symbols, we evaluate the exponent before the other operations.

In the subsequent activities, students solidify their understanding of this key concept.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Try the @printable-exercise{expression-to-circles-matching.adoc} to practice matching Circles with their corresponding mathematical expressions.
- Translate between Circles, mathematical expressions, and words on @printable-exercise{translating-exponent-expressions.adoc}
- In @printable-exercise{wodb.adoc}, analyze the Circles to determine which expressions in the set are equivalent.

The first two worksheets below do not involve _any_ computation; rather, students think about the structure of expressions with exponents and one additional operation. The third worksheet in the set can involve some computation; students who consider structure will complete the activity more efficiently.


=== Synthesize

- Is @math{2 + (6^2)} equivalent to @math{2 + 6^2}? Why or why not?
** _Yes, these expressions are equivalent. Applying an exponent is a function separate from addition, regardless of whether we put it in parentheses or not._
- Is @math{2 + 6^2} equivalent to @math{(2 + 6)^2}? Why or why not?
** _No, these expressions are not equivalent. For the first expression, we apply the exponent and then multiply. For the second expression, we multiply and then apply the exponent._



== Expressions with Exponents and Variables @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students use Circles of Evaluation to parse and evaluate exponential expressions with variables.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Ms. Brenneman asked her class to evaluate @math{4m^2} for @math{m = 5}. Four students each produced a different Circle! Analyze them on Four Different Circles.
[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| Jayla: @show{(coe  '(* 4 (num-expt m 2)))} | Keke: @show{(coe  '(* 4 (num-expt 2 m)))}
| Joe: @show{(coe  '(+ 4 (num-expt m 2)))} 	| Aaron: @show{(coe  '(num-expt (* 4 m) 2))}
|===
- Which Circle do you think matches the expression? If you're not sure, are there any that you can rule out right away?
** _Sample response: Jayla's Circle is correct. I know that Keke's response is incorrect because we cannot change the order of the base and the exponent. Joe's doesn't work because he added rather than finding a prodcut. Aaron squared @math{4m}, rather than just squaring @math{m}._
- Evaluate each Circle. Do any of them produce the same outcome? Why or why not?
** _Each Circle has a different result because they all have different structures; one even has a different operation. Jayla's Circle is 100; Keke's is 132; Joe's is 29; and Aaron's is 400._
--

Lead a discussion where students explain which Circle they chose and why. Ensure that students understand that - even with the inclusion of variables - we still apply the exponent _before_ applying other operations, as established in the previous lesson.

=== Common Misconceptions

Students who are new to expressions like @math{4m^2} may misinterpret them. Explain that this notation represents multiplication - not that the two digits are simply next to one another.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at the three-column table on Variable Expressions with Exponents.
- Either draw a Circle to match the expression, or write an expression to match the Circle.
- Once you have completely filled in the first and second column, move to the third column, where you will evaluate each expressions by substituting in the given value.
