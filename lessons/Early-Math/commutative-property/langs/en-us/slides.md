# The Commutative Property

- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/discover-comm.adoc}. What do you Notice about the two Circles of Evaluation in the first problem? What do you Wonder?

<!--
Build on prior knowledge by reminding students of the activity that they completed in the previous lesson. You might even refer to the list of category names that the class created, and then draw students’ attention to any category names that allude to or suggest commutativity. (Any mention of “changing the order” is a strong hint that students’ have clued into the Commutative Property!)

Students might notice that both Circles evaluate to 360, and that the order of the numbers changes from one Circle of Evaluation to the next.

# The Commutative Property


- Work through the remaining problems with your partner. When you finish the page, move on to @printable-exercise{pages/discover-comm-cont.adoc}.
- What did you observe about the Commutative Property?

<!--
In each of the examples, the values were the same but the order of the values was different. Sometimes the structures of the Circles of Evaluation changed, like when I moved a nested circle from the right to the left. The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not for subtraction or division.

# The Commutative Property

The *_Commutative Property_* tells us that for any expression involving only addition or only multiplication, changing the order of the numbers will not change the result.{style="font-size:24pt"}

# The Commutative Property

- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/comm-prop-table.adoc}.
- How many different ways can you apply the Commutative Property? Draw as many different Circles of Evaluation as you can. The first one (below) is done for you.

@image{images/comm-prop-table.png}

<!--
This activity is similar to one students’ completed during the previous lesson. In both activities, students develop equivalent expressions. That said, in this lesson, students cannot write down any equivalent Circle of Evaluation; they must develop equivalent arithmetic expressions that illustrate commutativity.

As students work, draw their attention to the operation as they rearrange the values inside the circle, helping them to notice that the Commutative Property does not apply for division and subtraction.

# The Commutative Property

- How come some of the expressions generated fewer equivalent Circles of Evaluation than others?
- What did you notice about the final problem on the page?

<!--
Q1 Possible response: When expressions included addition and multiplication, there were many equivalent expressions, whereas division and subtraction resulted in fewer (or no) equivalent expressions.

Q2 possible response: It was impossible to apply the Commutative Property because there were no instances of multiplication or addition, only division and subtraction.

# The Commutative Property


- For which operations does the Commutative Property hold?
- When applying the Commutative Property, did the groupings of the numbers ever change?
- Which type of Circles had the most equivalent Circles? Which Circles had the least amount of equivalent Circles (or none!)?

<!--
Q1: The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not division or subtraction.

Q2: No; the Commutative Property does not allow for different groupings of numbers. When we apply the Commutative Property, we change the *order* of the values.

Q3: Possible response: Circles with only addition and multiplication, as well as Circles with many nested Circles, allowed for more equivalent representations. When Circles included division and subtraction, I could not develop as many equivalent expressions.

# Tying it All Together

Claire, Walker, and Soraya are both translating verbal expressions into Circles of Evaluation. Their teacher asks them to represent the following expression: "one half the product of five and six."

All three students compute that this expression evaluates to 15.

# Tying it All Together

The teacher looks at their work. She definitely likes Claire’s Circle of Evaluation, but she can’t decide Soraya's and Walker's are good translations or not.

What do you think? Are Soraya and Walker correct - or just Claire?

<!--
** _Arguments against Walker's Circle of Evaluation: The verbal expression starts with one half, and then multiplies that by 5x6. Walker’s Circle is not a direct translation._
** _Arguments against Soraya's Circle of Evaluation: The expression divides by two, whereas the verbal expression seems to imply multiplication by one half._
** _Arguments for Walker's and Soraya's Circles of Evaluation: When we use computation, these Circles evaluate to 15. The Commutative Property indicates that we can multiply factors in any order. Similarly, dividing by two produces the same result as multiplying by one half._

# Tying it All Together

- Look at @printable-exercise{pages/claire-and-walker.adoc} with some additional work by Claire and Walker. Their teacher awards credit when her students translate the expression precisely __or__ when they show a deep understanding of computation or commutativity.
- In the column on the right, record if Claire, Walker, or both students correctly translated the words into a Circle.

# Tying it All Together

- Optional: Complete @printable-exercise{pages/words-to-circles-challenge.adoc}: Claire and Walker each draw a Circle of Evaluation for the following expression: _Add 10 and 2. Multiply the sum by 3. Next, add 1 to the product, then double the result._  Who is correct?

# Tying it All Together


- Claire and Soraya want to write an equivalent expression for @math{45 \div 9}. Claire studies the expression and announces that, because it involves division, the Commutative Property cannot be applied. Is she correct?
- Soraya grabs a pencil and writes the following: @math{45 \times \frac{1}{9}}. She says, "There! I fixed it. Now we can apply the Commutative Property." Explain what Soraya did. Is she correct?
