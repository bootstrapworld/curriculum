= Which Circle of Evaluation is Correct? Challenge

Claire and Walker each draw a Circle of Evaluation for the following expression: _Add 10 and 2. Multiply the sum by 3. Next, add 1 to the product, then double the result._ Examine their work and then write your analysis, below.

@n Is Claire correct? Is Walker correct? Explain. How are their Circles of Evaluation alike? Different? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both Circles are correct.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The innermost Circle for both Claire and Walker is @math{10 + 2}. Walker applies the Commutative property, adding and multiplying}}
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{in an order different than the order stated in the problem. His Circle of Evaluation evaluates to the same result, however.}}
