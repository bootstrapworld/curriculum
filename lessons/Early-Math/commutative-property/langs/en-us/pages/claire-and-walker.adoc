For each of the expressions in words, look at the Circles of Evaluation that Claire and Walker drew. Then, decide who is correct: Claire, Walker, or both? Justify your response.

|	 | Expression in words: | Claire's Circle: | Walker's Circle: | Who is correct? Justify.

| @n
| Find the quotient of 15 and 5. Multiply it by 6.
| @show{(coe '(* (/ 15 5) 6))}
| @show{(coe '(* (/ 5 15) 6))}
| @ifsoln{Claire's Circle of Evaluation is correct. "The quotient of 15 and 5" translates to @math{15 \div 5}. Division is not Commutative.}

| @n
| Double 8. Now add 7.
| @show{(coe '(+ (* 2 8) 7))}
| @show{(coe '(+ 7 (* 2 8)))}
| @ifsoln{Both Circles represent the expression in words. Claire's Circle of Evaluation more accurately reflects the stated order, however.}

| @n
| 5 less than the product of 5 and 20.
| @show{(coe '(- 5 (* 5 20)))}
| @show{(coe '(- (* 20 5) 5))}
| @ifsoln{Walker's Circle of Evaluation is correct. Taking "5 less than" entails subtracting 5. Subtraction is not commutative.}

| @n
| One half of the quotient of 36 and 9.
| @show{(coe '(* 1/2 (/ 36 9)))}
| @show{(coe '(* (/ 36 9) 1/2))}
| @ifsoln{Both Circles of Evaluation are correct. The Commutative Property suggests we can multiply two values in any order.}

| @n
| Subtract 6 from the 20 tripled.
| @show{(coe '(- (* 20 3) 6))}
| @show{(coe '(- 6 (* 3 20)))}
| @ifsoln{Claire's Circle of Evaluation is correct. Subtraction is not commutative.}


| @n
| The product of 4 and the difference of 3 and 1.
| @show{(coe '(* 4 (- 1 3)))}
| @show{(coe '(* 4 (- 3 1)))}
| @ifsoln{Walker's Circle of Evaluation is correct. Subtraction is not commutative; "the difference of 3 and 1" must be translated as @math{3 - 1}.}
