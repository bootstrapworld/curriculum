== The Commutative Property

=== Overview

Students analyze pairs of Circles to see if they represent equivalent expressions. The Circles make visible the structural changes that occur when we apply the Commutative Property.

=== Launch

Build on prior knowledge by reminding students of the activity that they completed in the previous lesson. You might even refer to the list of category names that the class created, and then draw students’ attention to any category names that allude to or suggest the commutativity. (Any mention of “changing the order” is a strong hint that students’ have clued into the Commutative Property!)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, turn to @printable-exercise{discover-comm.adoc}. Look at the first problem. What do you Notice about the two Circles? What do you Wonder?
- Work through the remaining problems with your partner. When you finish the page, move on to @printable-exercise{discover-comm-cont.adoc}.
- What did you observe about the Commutative Property?
** _Possible responses: In each of the examples, the values were the same but the order of the values was different. Sometimes the Circle structure changed, like when I moved a nested circle on the right to become a nested circle on the left. The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not subtraction or division._

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{comm-prop-table.adoc}.
- How many different ways can you apply the Commutative Property? Draw as many different Circles of Evaluation as you can.

This activity is similar to one students’ completed during the previous lesson. In both activities, students develop equivalent expressions. That said, in this lesson, students cannot write down _any_ equivalent circle; they must develop equivalent Circles that represent the commutativity.

As students work, draw their attention to the operation as they rearrange the values inside the circle, helping them to notice that the Commutative Property does not apply for division and subtraction.

[.lesson-instruction]
- How come some of the Circles had fewer equivalent Circles than others?
** _Possible response: When expressions included addition and multiplication, there were many equivalent expressions, whereas division and subtraction resulted in fewer (or no) equivalent expressions._
- What did you notice about the final Circle on the worksheet?
** _Possible response: It was impossible to apply the Commutative Property because there were no instances of multiplication or addition, only division and subtraction._

=== Common Misconception

Students may attempt to apply other properties when developing equivalent Circles. In such instances, help students to see that their Circle is indeed equivalent, is not an example of the Commutative Property at work.

=== Synthesize

- For which operations does the Commutative Property hold?
** _The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not division or subtraction._
- When applying the Commutative Property, did the groupings of the numbers ever change?
** _No; the Commutative Property does not allow for different groupings of numbers. When we apply the Commutative Property, we change the *order* of the values._
- Which type of Circles had the most equivalent Circles? Which Circles had the least amount of equivalent Circles (or none!)?
** _Possible response: Circles with only addition and multiplication, as well as Circles with many nested Circles, allowed for more equivalent representations. When Circles included division and subtraction, I could not develop as many equivalent expressions._

== Tying it All Together

=== Overview

Students connect and apply what they have learned so far about translation, computation, and the Commutative Property.

=== Launch

Explain to your students that Claire and Walker are both translating expressions in words into Circles of Evaluation. Their teacher asks them to represent the following expression: "one half the product of five and six."

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===

| Claire draws this:				| Walker draws this:
|@show{(coe  '(* 1/2 (* 5 6)))}		| @show{(coe  '(* (* 5 6) 1/2))}
|===

Both students compute that this expression evaluates to 15.

The teacher looks at their work. She definitely likes Claire’s Circle, but she can’t decide Walker's is a good translation or not.

[.lesson-instruction]
- What do you think? Are Claire _and_ Walker correct - or just Claire?
** _Arguments against Walker's Circle: The expression states that we start with one half, and then multiply that by 5x6. Walker’s Circle is not a direct translation._
** _Arguments for Walker's Circle: When we use computation, both Circles evaluate to 15. Both Walker and Claire are taking half of 30. The Commutative Property indicates that we can multiply factors in any order._

Be sure to challenge students to consider both perspectives: although Claire’s Circle is a more direct translation, Walker has demonstrated (1) an understanding of the Commutative Property, and (2) an understanding of how computation can produce equivalent Circles.

=== Investigate

Before moving on to the next activity, emphasize to students that Walker and Claire’s Circles are _different_ but still _equivalent_. Computation helps us to verify that!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at @printable-exercise{claire-and-walker.adoc} with some additional work by Claire and Walker. Their teacher awards credit when her students translate the expression precisely _or_ when they show a deep understanding of computation or commutativity.
- In the column on the right, record if Claire, Walker, or both students correctly translated the words into a Circle.
- Optional: Complete @printable-exercise{words-to-circles-challenge.adoc} to analyze Circles of Evaluation and commutativity for a more complex expression in words.

Discuss and debrief with students. Invite students to verbally share their responses to reinforce important vocabulary and concepts that students will use again and again in future lessons.

=== Synthesize

Do you translate words into Circles precisely and directly – or do you sometimes make changes to your Circles as you translate? Why?

If you were a teacher, would you require _exact_ translations of circles, or would you allow students to modify their Circles when translating?
