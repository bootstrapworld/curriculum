== The Commutative Property

=== Overview

Students examine pairs of Circles of Evaluation to see whether they represent equivalent expressions. The Circles of Evaluation reveal the structural changes that occur when we apply the Commutative Property.

=== Launch

Build on prior knowledge by reminding students of the activity that they completed in the previous lesson. You might even refer to the list of category names that the class created, and then draw students’ attention to any category names that allude to or suggest commutativity. (Any mention of “changing the order” is a strong hint that students’ have clued into the @vocab{Commutative Property}!)

@lesson-instruction{
- Now, turn to @printable-exercise{discover-comm.adoc}. What do you Notice about the two Circles of Evaluation in the first problem? What do you Wonder?
** _Students might notice that both Circles evaluate to 360, and that the order of the numbers changes from one Circle of Evaluation to the next._
- Work through the remaining problems with your partner. When you finish the page, move on to @printable-exercise{discover-comm-cont.adoc}.
- What did you observe about the Commutative Property?
** _Possible responses: In each of the examples, the values were the same but the order of the values was different. Sometimes the structures of the Circles of Evaluation changed, like when I moved a nested circle from the right to the left. The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not for subtraction or division._
}

Before moving on in the lesson, ensure that students understand the following:

@lesson-point{
For any expression involving only addition or only multiplication, changing the order of the numbers will not change the result.
}

Students will apply their understanding of the Commutative Property throughout the remainder of the lesson.

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{comm-prop-table.adoc}.
- How many different ways can you apply the Commutative Property? Draw as many different Circles of Evaluation as you can.
}

This activity is similar to one students’ completed during the previous lesson. In both activities, students develop equivalent expressions. That said, in this lesson, students cannot write down _any_ equivalent Circle of Evaluation; they must develop @vocab{equivalent} @vocab{arithmetic expressions} that illustrate _commutativity_.

As students work, draw their attention to the operation as they rearrange the values inside the Circles of Evaluation, helping to reinforce that the Commutative Property does not apply for division and subtraction.

@lesson-instruction{
- How come some of the expressions generated fewer equivalent Circles of Evaluation than others?
** _Possible response: When expressions included addition and multiplication, there were many equivalent expressions, whereas division and subtraction resulted in fewer (or no) equivalent expressions._
- What did you notice about the final problem on the page?
** _Possible response: It was impossible to apply the Commutative Property because there were no instances of multiplication or addition, only division and subtraction._
}

=== Common Misconception

Students may attempt to apply other properties when developing equivalent Circles. In such instances, help students to see that their Circle of Evaluation is indeed equivalent, but is not an example of the Commutative Property at work.

=== Synthesize

- For which operations does the Commutative Property hold?
** _The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not division or subtraction._
- When applying the Commutative Property, did the groupings of the numbers ever change?
** _No; the Commutative Property does not allow for different groupings of numbers. When we apply the Commutative Property, we change the *order* of the values._
- Which type of Circles had the most equivalent Circles? Which Circles had the least amount of equivalent Circles (or none!)?
** _Possible response: Circles with only addition and multiplication, as well as Circles with many nested Circles, allowed for more equivalent representations. When Circles included division and subtraction, I could not develop as many equivalent expressions._

== Tying it All Together

=== Overview

Students connect and apply what they have learned so far about translation, computation, and the Commutative Property.

=== Launch

Explain to your students that Claire, Walker, and Soraya are translating verbal expressions into Circles of Evaluation. Their teacher asks them to represent the following expression: "one half the product of five and six."

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===

| Claire draws this:				| Walker draws this:				| Soraya draws this:
|@show{(coe  '(* 1/2 (* 5 6)))}		| @show{(coe  '(* (* 5 6) 1/2))}	| @show{(coe '(/ (* 5 6) 2))}
|===

All three students compute that this expression evaluates to 15.

The teacher looks at their work. She definitely likes Claire’s Circle of Evaluation, but she can’t decide if Soraya's and Walker's are good translations or not.

@lesson-instruction{
- What do you think? Are Soraya and Walker correct - or just Claire?
** _Arguments against Walker's Circle of Evaluation: The verbal expression starts with one half, and then multiplies that by 5x6. Walker’s Circle is not a direct translation._
** _Arguments against Soraya's Circle of Evaluation: The expression divides by two, whereas the verbal expression seems to imply multiplication by one half._
** _Arguments for Walker's and Soraya's Circles of Evaluation: When we use computation, these Circles evaluate to 15. The Commutative Property indicates that we can multiply factors in any order. Similarly, dividing by two produces the same result as multiplying by one half._
}

Challenge students to consider a variety of perspectives: although Claire’s Circle is a more direct translation, Walker has demonstrated an understanding of the Commutative Property, while Soraya's work suggests an understanding of fraction multiplication. All students' Circles of Evaluation highlight how computation can produce equivalent Circles.

=== Investigate

Before moving on to the next activity, emphasize to students that Walker, Claire and Soraya's Circles are _different_ but still _equivalent_. Computation helps us to verify that!

@lesson-instruction{
- Look at @printable-exercise{which-coe-is-correct.adoc} with some additional work by Claire and Walker. Their teacher awards credit when her students translate the expression precisely __or__ when they show a deep understanding of computation or commutativity.
- In the column on the right, record if Claire, Walker, or both students correctly translated the words into a Circle.
- @optional Complete @opt-printable-exercise{which-coe-is-correct-2.adoc} to analyze Circles of Evaluation and commutativity for a more complex expression in words.
}

Discuss and debrief with students. Invite students to verbally share their responses to reinforce important vocabulary and concepts that students will use again and again in future lessons.

=== Synthesize

- Summarize the Commutative Property in your own words.
- How might a strong understanding of the Commutative Property could be useful when you're doing computations in your head?





== Programming Exploration: Commutativity and Code @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Extending concepts explored earlier in the lesson, students consider whether various functions that we use when coding are commutative.

=== Launch

You already know that in math, the Commutative Property allows us to rewrite mathematical expressions in a variety of different ways. For any expression involving only addition or only multiplication, changing the order of the numbers will not change the result.

But how about functions in @proglang?!

As a programmer, you will definitely want to know if you can change around the order of a function's arguments... or if you need to adhere to just one single order. Let's dig in!

=== Investigate


@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{are-they-commutative.adoc}.
- Discuss the Circles of Evaluation and the corresponding code. Make a prediction about what will appear and whether the function is commutative.
- Test your code in @starter-file{editor} to determine if the images produced are identical or not.
}

@teacher{As students work, encourage them to _always_ make predictions before testing the code. Similarly, the activity will be more valuable if students discuss _why_ the code did or did not produce identical images. Debrief to ensure comprehension.}

@slidebreak

@QandA{

@Q{What were some of the strategies you used to predict if the lines of code were equivalent?}
@A{We used computation; we paid attention to the order of arguments; we referred to contracts to understand the effect of each input. Responses will vary.}

@Q{How was this activity similar to the activities you completed earlier in this lesson? How was it different?}
@A{*Similar:* We used computation. We wanted to see if the outcomes would be the same or not. *Different:* We were looking at images, not numbers; We relied on contracts to help us predict the output, not our understanding of mathematical operations. Responses will vary.}
}

@teacher{Ensuring comprehension of @printable-exercise{are-they-identical.adoc} will lead to a smoother experience on @printable-exercise{writing-equivalent-code.adoc}. In the second activity, just _one_ line of code is provided - and students develop the second on their own. Students will exercise a different cognitive muscle here: rather than making a prediction about code, they must write their own!}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- On @printable-exercise{writing-equivalent-code.adoc}, test the provided line of code in @starter-file{editor}.
- With your partner, write a __different__ but equivalent line of code. (It must produce an identical image!)
- If you get stuck, refer to your contracts and draw Circles of Evaluation!}

@slidebreak

=== Synthesize

- What were some strategies you used to determine if two different lines of code will produce identical images?
- How were the programming activities in this lesson similar to the paper-and-pencil activities? How were they different?
