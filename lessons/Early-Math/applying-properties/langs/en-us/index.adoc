== Equivalent Expressions Brainstorm @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students analyze expressions in words and consider all of the different possible Circles of Evaluation they can create.

=== Launch

Believe it or not, _every_ mathematical expression we encounter can be rewritten in one way or another! @math{a + b} can become @math{b + a}, @math{g - h} can become @math{g + -h}, the list goes on...

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to Equivalent Expression Webs. At the top of this page, you see an expression: _Find one-third of 27. Now add five._
- Draw a Circle of Evaluation to represent this expression as precisely as possible.
- Label the first arrow on the left with a property that you know you can apply. Draw the equivalent Circle.
- Repeat the process. How many different results can we come up with?

Encourage students to use a varieth of approaches for generating equivalent expressions, including the Associative Property, the Commutative Property, computation, and any combination of any of the above.

Note: This might be a good opportunity to revisit the list of different categories of Circle Transformations that you developed during the opening lesson. How have students understanding of laws of arithmetic evolved?

=== Investigate

Note: Students can complete this activity using either two sets of printed cards, or the interactive Desmos version.

[.lesson-instruction]
- You and your partner are going to receive two sets of cards - Words and Circles.
- With your partner, carefully examine each of the four words cards. Lay them out neatly on the table in front of you.
- Take turns looking at cards from the Circles pile. Sort each Circle cards with the Words card that it matches.

As students sort the cards, encourage them to talk to one another, explain their reasoning, and - when in doubt - use computation to confirm equivalence.

=== Synthesize

- Were there any cards that were especially easy to match? Especially difficult?
- Are there any Circle Transformations that you generally have a tough time recognizing?



== THIS SECTION NEEDS WORK, I'VE GOT SOME IDEAS. Probably not worth reading now. Volume of Rectangle Prisms @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students see the Commutative and Associative Property at play as they consider different strategies for finding the volume of a rectangular prism.

=== Launch

Arrange students in small groups. Give each group a pile of 40 cubes.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Your group's task is to build a rectangular prism with _all_ of the cubes in front of you.
- Once you have built the prism, think about how you would explain to a friend how you determine the amount of unit cubes in your solid.
- Try to generate as many ways as possible to think about the amount of cubes in the prism.
- If you run out of ways to think about the volume of your prism... build a different prism, with different dimensions! You must always use all 40 cubes.

After about five minutes of independent work, invite students to share their responses. Some students may count each individual cubes, while others will look at layers, and very likely some will think about multiplying @math{length \times width \times height}.

As students share, draw Circles of Evaluation to represent their thinking. For instance, the Circle to represent 2 layers of 20 cubes each would look like this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(* 2 20))}
@clear

The Circle for 5 layers that are each 2 cubes by 4 cubes would look like this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(* 5 (* 2 4)))}
@clear

Some students may even think about adding together the layers, like this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ (+ 10 10) (+ 10 10)))}
@clear


Invite students to notice relationships between the Circles. Draw arrows and label them accordingly (Commutative Property, Associative Property, Computation) between the Circles.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete the Visualizing Volume worksheet. The first row is done for you.
// idea for worksheet = students read a description of how a kid found volume, for instance: "I envisioned 3 layers of 12". Students draw the circle representing that (and vice versa). //
- As you progress through the worksheet, you will be asked to develop your own ways to visualize volume.


=== Synthesize

- How do you prefer to think of volume of rectangular prisms?
** _Some students may see horizontal layers while others see vertical ones. Some students may visualize the least number of layers while others may prefer to see many._
