# Seeing Equivalence

Look at Equation 1, below. 

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@image{images/eq1.png}

<!--
** _Possible responses: The outer circle subtracts @math{4}, the inner circle multiplies 22 and 3. The difference between the two Circles of Evaluation is that @math{22} and @math{3} swap positions._

# Seeing Equivalence

Now, look at Equation 2.

Here, what do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@image{images/eq2.png}

<!--
Possible responses: The same numbers and operations are included. This time, the difference between the Circles of Evaluation is that the 4 moves from the beginning to the end.

# Seeing Equivalence

Which is true: Equation 1, Equation 2, or both? How do you know?

@image{images/eq1&2.png}


<!--
** _The first equation is true. We see the Commutative Property of multiplication being applied when @math{22 \times 3} is transformed to @math{3 \times 22}._
** _In the second equation, it looks as though there has been a misguided attempted to apply the Commutative Property; this does not work because the Commutative Property does not hold for subtraction._
** _We can also use Computation to verify that both sides of the first equation equal @math{62}. The second equation's left side is @math{62}, but its right side is @math{-62}._

# Seeing Equivalence

We have learned that computation is an effective strategy for determining whether or not two expressions are equivalent. 

Pretty soon we'll be looking at expressions with variables, where our computation strategy won't work as well. 

Let's see if we can figure out how to determine whether or not two expressions are equivalent without computation! 

<!--
For now, while students are still looking at expressions with numbers, they can double check their thinking with computation.

# Seeing Equivalence

- Summarize the Associative Property in your own words. When does it apply?
- Summarize the Commutative Property in your own words. When does it apply?
- How can we computation to verify equivalence?
- Can you think of any expressions involving subtraction or division when the Associative Property or the Commutative Property would apply?
- What strategies did you use to locate equations that were false, or expressions that did not belong?

# Equivalence with Variables

- In this class, sometimes we’ll work with @vocab{variables} - symbols that stand for values we don’t know yet.
- The equation @math{c + a = r} could be true or false.
- What are some values that make the equation true?
- What are some values that make the equation false?

<!--
- What are some values that make the equation true?
** _Sample answer: @math{c = 5}, @math{a = 10}, @math{r = 15}_
- What are some values that make the equation false?
** _Sample answer: @math{c = 1}, @math{a = 2}, @math{r = 900}_

# Equivalence with Variables

We can represent the Associative Property like this:

# Equivalence with Variables

Or like this:

# Equivalence with Variables

The same goes for the Commutative Property! We can represent it with variables, like this:

# Equivalence with Variables

The Associative and Commutative Properties will hold no matter what values we substitute in for our variables.

These examples on the previous slides show us that mathematical properties are _more powerful_ than sheer computation!

<!--
We can't use computation to prove that @math{12 + h} and @math{h + 12} are equivalent  – because without knowing what @math{h} is, we can't evaluate the expression! Commutativity lets us prove that these expressions are equivalent even with variables.

# Equivalence with Variables

Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false-variables.adoc} using your knowledge of the Associative Property and the Commutative Property. The first problem is below.

@image{images/true-or-false2.png}

<!--
This activity (and the subsequent one) invites students to apply their knowledge of the Associative and Commutative Properties in equations and Circles of Evaluation that include variables. For some students, this cognitive leap can be a challenging one. The familiarity of the workbook pages (they all parallel those in the previous section) can make this transition a bit smoother.

Students are also welcome to choose values to represent the variables if they in fact want to evaluate the expressions to confirm if they are equivalent (or not). Early finishers can substitute in numbers of their choosing to confirm that their analyses of the Circles of Evaluation are correct. The ability to make substitutions to check equivalence is an extremely valuable skill.

If students get stuck, ask: What do you notice, at first glance? What makes the Circles of Evaluation alike? What makes them different?

# Equivalence with Variables

- Are equations with variables always true?
- What does it mean for two expressions with variables to be equivalent?

<!--
- Are equations with variables always true?
** _No. If we see a representation of the Associative Property or the Commutative Property, then yes. An equation such as @math{j - y = y - j} is only sometimes true. And an equation like @math{g \times 0 = 600} is never true._
- What does it mean for two expressions with variables to be equivalent?
** _When two expressions with variables are equivalent, that means that *no matter what number we substitute in,* we will still get the same result._
