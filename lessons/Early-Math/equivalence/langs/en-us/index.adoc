== Seeing Equivalence @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students examine Circles to determine if two expressions are equivalent or not, applying the @vocab{Commutative Property}, the @vocab{Associative Property}, and computation.

=== Launch
As we've observed, Circles and laws of arithmetic can help us understand whether an @vocab{equation} - a mathematical statement of equatility - is true or false.

Invite students to look at Equation 1, represented by these two Circles of Evaluation:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(- (* 22 3) 4))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(- (* 3 22) 4))}
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible responses: The outer circle subtracts @math{4}, the inner circle multiplies 22 and 3. The difference between the two Circles of Evaluation is that @math{22} and @math{3} swap positions._

Next, have students look at Equation 2, represented by these two Circles of Evaluation.

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(- (* 22 3) 4))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(- 4 (* 22 3)))}
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- Here, what do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible responses: The same numbers and operations are included. This time, the difference between the Circles of Evaluation is that the @math{4} moves from the beginning to the end._

After students have shared their observations and wonderings, begin a conversation about _truth_ and equations.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Which is true: Equation 1, Equation 2, or both? How do you know?
** _The first equation is true. We see the Commutative Property of multiplication being applied when @math{22 \times 3} is transformed to @math{3 \times 22}._
** _In the second equation, it looks as though there has been a misguided attempted to apply the Commutative Property; this does not work because the Commutative Property does not hold for subtraction._
** _We can also use Computation to verify that both sides of the first equation equal @math{62}. The second equation's left side is @math{62}, but its right side is @math{-62}._

As students observe and share out, urge them to justify their ideas about equivalence.

=== Investigate

We have learned that computation is an effective strategy for determining whether or not two expressions are equivalent. Pretty soon we'll be looking at expressions with variables, where our computation strategy won't work as well. Let's see if we can figure out how to determine whether or not two expressions are equivalent without computation! For now, while we're still looking at expressions with numbers, we can double check our thinking with computation.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc} using your knowledge of the Associative Property and the Commutative Property. Be sure to explain your responses.
- Finally, examine the Circles of Evaluation to decide @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong.adoc} Be sure to explain your thinking.

=== Synthesize

- Summarize the Associative Property in your own words. When does it apply?
- Summarize the Commutative Property in your own words. When does it apply?
- How can we computation to verify equivalence?
- Can you think of any expressions involving subtraction or division when the Associative Property or the Commutative Property would apply?
- What strategies did you use to locate equations that were false, or expressions that did not belong?


== Equivalence with Variables @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students examine Circles to determine if expressions with variables are equivalent.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- In this class, sometimes we’ll work with @vocab{variables} - symbols that stand for values we don’t know yet.
- The equation @math{c + a = r} could be true or false.
- What are some values that make the equation true?
** _Sample answer: @math{c = 5}, @math{a = 10}, @math{r = 15}_
- What are some values that make the equation false?
** _Sample answer: @math{c = 1}, @math{a = 2}, @math{r = 900}_

We can represent the Associative Property like this:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(* 2 (* 3 c)))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(* (* 2 3) c))}
| @math{2 \times (3 \times c)} 	| @math{=} | @math{(2 \times 3) \times c}
|===

Or like this:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(+ 5 (+ 6 m)))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(+ (+ 5 6) m))}
| @math{5 + (6 + m)} 			| @math{=} | @math{(5 + 6) + m}
|===

[.lesson-point]
The @vocab{Associative Property} will hold no matter what values we substitute in for @math{c} or for @math{m}.

The same goes for the @vocab{Commutative Property}! We can represent it with variables, like this:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(* 5 g))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(* g 5))}
| @math{5 \times g} 	| @math{=} | @math{g \times 5}
|===

Or like this:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(+ 12 h))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(+ h 12))}
| @math{12 + h} 			| @math{=} | @math{h + 12}
|===

It doesn't matter what values we use for @math{g} or for @math{h} - the equations above are _always_ true.

These examples above show us that the Commutative and Associative properties are in fact more powerful than sheer computation. We can't use computation to prove that @math{12 + h} and @math{h + 12} are equivalent  – because without knowing what @math{h} is, we can't evaluate the expression! Commutativity lets us prove that these expressions are equivalent even with variables.

=== Investigate

The activities below invite students to apply their knowledge of the Associative and Commutative Properties in equations and Circles of Evaluation _that include variables_. For some students, this cognitive leap can be a challenging one. The familiarity of the workbook pages (they all parallel those in the previous section) can make this transition a bit smoother.

Students are also welcome to choose values to represent the variables if they in fact want to evaluate the expressions to confirm if they are equivalent (or not). Early finishers can substitute in numbers of their choosing to confirm that their analyses of the Circles of Evaluation are correct. The ability to make substitutions to check equivalence is an extremely valuable skill.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false-variables.adoc} using your knowledge of the Associative Property and the Commutative Property.
- Examine each of the Circles of Evaluation to decide @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong-variables.adoc}. Be sure to explain your thinking.


If students get stuck, ask: What do you notice, at first glance? What makes the Circles of Evaluation alike? What makes them different?


=== Synthesize

- Are equations with variables always true?
** _No. If we see a representation of the Associative Property or the Commutative Property, then yes. An equation such as @math{j - y = y - j} is only sometimes true. And an equation like @math{g \times 0 = 600} is never true._
- What does it mean for two expressions with variables to be equivalent?
** _When two expressions with variables are equivalent, that means that *no matter what number we substitute in,* we will still get the same result._
