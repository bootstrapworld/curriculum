| Code
| Predict: Will both of these expressions produce the same result?
| Were you right? Explain. If the shapes are different, _why_ are they different?

| @n
| @show{(code '(square 40 "solid" "deeppink"))}

@show{(code '(rectangle 40 40 "solid" "deeppink"))}
| | @ifsoln{Yes, the shapes produced will be equivalent.}

| @n
| @show{(code '(radial-star 6 20 50 "solid" "red"))}

@show{(code '(radial-star (+ 3 3) (* 4 5) 50 "solid" "red"))}
| | @ifsoln{Yes, the shapes produced will be equivalent.}

| @show{(code '(circle 60 "outline" "tomato"))}

@show{(code '(ellipse 60 60 "outline" "tomato"))}
| | @ifsoln{No.}

| @n
| @show{(code '(circle 60 "solid" "lime"))}

@show{(code '(ellipse 120 120 "solid" "lime"))}
| | @ifsoln{Yes, the shapes produced will be equivalent.}

@show{(code '(rotate 270 (text "Azara" 150 "yellow")))}
| | @ifsoln{No, the images produced are not equivalent. The orientation of the text is different.}

| @n
| @show{(code '(right-triangle 100 100 "solid" "black"))}

@ show{(code '(rotate 90 (isosceles-triangle 100 90 "solid" "black")))}

|| @ifsoln{No, the shapes are oriented differently due to the amount of rotation.}
