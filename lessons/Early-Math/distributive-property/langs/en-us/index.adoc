| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Recognize how distribution results in equivalent expressions.
* Apply the Distributive Property to expressions with numbers and variables.
* Use distribution to efficiently complete mental computations.


| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's explore the Distributive Property and Circles of Evaluation.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* A common approach to teaching the Distributive Property is by using an area model. This approach works well for students who are comfortable visualizing and computing area - but may leave other students confused.
* We introduce the Distributive Property by inviting students to look at patterns in _structure_, and then later apply what they know using the area model.

== The Distributive Property @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students develop an understanding of the Distributive Property by looking at equivalent Circles.

=== Launch

Elise and Dani are discussing the two Circles, below.

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(* 9 (+ 40 6)))} | @show{(coe '(+ (* 9 40) (* 9 6)))}
|===

Elise thinks that the Circles are equivalent. She says, "Both Circles have 9, 40, and 6. The Circles include the same values, so they must be equivalent."

Dani disagrees. She says, "I don't think so... The Circle on the right has multiplication at the top, but the Circle on the right has addition on the top. And why does 9 show up twice in the Circle on the right?"

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Do you agree with Elise? Dani? Why?
** _Allow students to share their approaches. The Circles are equivalent - but Elise's explanation is not complete._
- Try using computation to evaluate each Circle. What do you notice?
** _Sample responses: The Circles are equivalent. They both evaluate to 414. To evaluate the first Circle, I found a *product*. To evaluate the second Circle, I found a *sum*._
--

Share with students that the Circles are equivalent because of the @vocab{Distributive Property}, whereby @math{a \times (b + c) = ab + ac}. Facilitate a discussion where students think deeply about what is happening in the scenario above, namely, that distribution allows us to rewrite a product as a sum or a sum as a product.

[.lesson-point]
Multiplying the sum of two addends by a number produces the same result as multiplying _each_ addend by that number and then adding the products.


In the next activity, students will use Circles to explore how mathematical structure shifts when we apply Distributive Property.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On @printable-exercise{fill-in-blanks.adoc}, fill in the blanks so that the Circle on the right is equivalent to the Circle on the left.
- Use computation to confirm that the Circles in each pair are equivalent.
- After you finish evaluating each Circle, place a checkmark next to the Circle that you think results in a simpler comuptation.
- When was it easier to compute the _sum_? When was it easier to compute the _product_?
** _There are no right or wrong answers, here. We want students to begin to consider how a nuanced understanding of the Distributive Property can result in more flexible and efficient mental math._
- On @printable-exercise{fill-in-blanks-2.adoc}, the Circle representing a _product_ is provided, and you will complete the Circle that represents a sum.

=== Investigate

Now Elise and Dani are discussing another pair of Circles.

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(* 5 43))} | @show{(coe '(+ 200 8))}
|===

Dani thinks the Circles are equivalent. She says, "You can think of 43 as the sum of 40 and 3. Then, you multiply 5 by 40 to get 200, and you add 5 and 3 to get 8."

Elise says, "The second Circle should say 200 + 15, not 200 + 8."

[.lesson-instruction]
- Who is correct - Elise or Dani?
** _Elise is correct. We need to multiply each value by 5._
** _Note - it may be helpful for some students to see the Circle for @math{(5 \times 40) + (5 \times 3)}._

The activities in the Launch focused on students' internalizing the structure of expressions both before and after applying the Distributive Property. During this segment of the lesson, students apply what they have learned.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}, where you will determine if equations represented by Circles are true or false.
- Next, try @printable-exercise{wodb.adoc}.

=== Synthesize

- A common idea about arithmetic is that we must _always_ evaluate what's inside the parentheses first. Do you agree with this idea? Explain.
- Summarize the Distributive Property in your own words.

== The Distributive Property and Mental Math @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Look at this expression: @math{45 \times 81 - 45 \times 79}
- Can we simplify this to an equivalent expression? How?
** _We can apply the Distributive Property, turning this into @math{45 \times (81 - 79)}._
- Can you represent your solving process with Circles?
** _Invite a student to draw a Circle representation on the board. See below for a possible Circle representation._
--

[.embedded, cols="^.^5,^.^1,^.^4,^.^1,^.^3,^.^1,^.^2", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe '(- (* 45 81) (* 45 79)))} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(* 45 (- 81 79)))} | &rarr; | @show{(coe '(* 45 2))} | &rarr; | 90

The goal of this exercise is to help students recognize an important feature of the Distributive Property, namely:

[.lesson-point]
We can use distribution and mental math to make computation simpler.


=== Investigate

If we were asked to compute @math{70 \times 39}, we could do so using a calculator or the standard algorithm. Now that we are familiar with the Distributive Property, we have a valuable tool for efficient mental computation.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{mental-math.adoc} and look at the first problem.
- Instead of finding the product of 70 and 39, we will find the product of 70 and the difference of 40 and 1.
- Complete the next Circle, which shows that we are going to find the difference between two products.
- Do you find this process more efficient than the standard algorithm for multiplication? Explain.
- Complete the rest of the worksheet.

=== Synthesize

How can you multiply two 2-digit numbers using mental math?
