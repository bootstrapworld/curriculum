# The Distributive Property

Look closely at the two Circles of Evaluation below.

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@image{images/notice-wonder.png}

<!--
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible Noticings: The Circles of Evaluation have different structures. One has a single nested Circle, while the other has two nested Circles. Both include the numberes 9, 40, and 6. Both include addition and multiplication._
** _Possible Wonderings: Are these equivalent? What do they evaluate to? Why is there one 9 in the first Circle of Evaluation, but two 9s in the second Circle?_

# The Distributive Property

The Circles of Evaluation are equivalent because of the Distributive Property, whereby @math{a \times (b + c) = ab + ac}. Distribution allows us to rewrite:
- a product as a sum
- a sum as a product

{layout="LaunchC"}
# The Distributive Property

- On @printable-exercise{pages/sum-to-product.adoc}, fill in the blanks so that the Circle of Evaluation on the right is equivalent to the Circle of Evaluation on the left.
- Use computation to confirm that the Circles of Evaluation in each pair are equivalent.
- Place a checkmark next to the Circle of Evaluation that you think results in a simpler computation.

# The Distributive Property

When was it easier to compute the _sum_? When was it easier to compute the _product_?

<!--
** _There are no right or wrong answers, here. We want students to begin to consider how a nuanced understanding of the Distributive Property can result in more flexible and efficient mental math._

{layout="Launch"}
# The Distributive Property

On @printable-exercise{pages/product-to-sum.adoc}, the Circle of Evaluation representing a product is provided, and you will complete the Circle of Evaluation that represents a sum.

# The Distributive Property

- Now try @printable-exercise{pages/distribution-challenge.adoc}, where you will practice applying the Distributive Property in both directions - and with expressions that include fractions and decimals!

# The Distributive Property

Elise and Dani are discussing a pair of Circles of Evaluation (below). Who is correct?

Dani thinks the Circles of Evaluation are equivalent. She says, "You can think of 43 as the sum of 40 and 3. Then, you multiply 5 by 40 to get 200, and you add 5 and 3 to get 8."

Elise says, "The second Circle should say 200 + 15, not 200 + 8."

@image{images/elise-dani.png}

<!--
** _Elise is correct. We need to multiply each value by 5._
** _Note - it may be helpful for some students to see the Circle for @math{(5 \times 40) + (5 \times 3)}._

# The Distributive Property

Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/true-or-false.adoc}, where you will determine if equations represented by the Circles of Evaluation are true or false. Explain your response. The first problem is below.

# The Distributive Property

Next, try @printable-exercise{pages/wodb.adoc}. Cross out the Circle of Evaluation that doesn’t belong with the others, and then explain your choice. The first problem is below.

{layout="Synthesize"}
# The Distributive Property

Elise and Dani are looking at this problem:

@math{4 \times (100 - 1.25)} 

Dani tells Elise that we must _always_ evaluate what's inside the parentheses first. Do you agree with this idea - or can Dani be more flexible? Explain.

<!--
** _Some students may suggest that distributing is a way of addressing the grouping symbol. Others may agree with Dani. We encourage you to discuss with your students the pros and cons of a flexible approach to solving. In this particular instance, applying the Distributive Property results in a much simpler computation._

# The Distributive Property & Mental Math

Look at this expression: 

@math{45 \times 81 - 45 \times 79}

Can we use the Distributive Property simplify this to an equivalent expression? How?

Can you represent your solving process with a chain of Circles of Evaluation?

@math{45 \times 81 - 45 \times 79}

We can use distribution and mental math to make computation simpler!{style="font-size:24pt"}

<!--
Note: In expressions such as @math{45 \times (81 - 79)}, the multiplication sign is unnecessary and implied when not there. Encourage students to try out this notation, especially if it is one that they have not encountered before.

# The Distributive Property & Mental Math

- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/mental-math.adoc} and look at the first problem.
- Make the math easier by creating an equivalent expression that we can solve in our heads. 
- Let's talk through the first problem.

@image{images/mental-math.png}

<!--
- Complete the next Circle of Evaluation, which shows that we are going to _distribute_ 70.
- We can now compute our solution by finding difference between two products.

- Do you find this process more efficient than the standard algorithm for multiplication? Explain.
- Complete the rest of the page by creating equivalent expressions that we can solve in our heads.

- How can you multiply two 2-digit numbers using mental math?
- Can you think of a multiplication problem that would be _easier_ to solve using the Distributive Property?
- What sorts of problems are simpler to compute using the Distributive Property?

** _Note: We recommend inviting many students to share the problems they come up with. Make a list on the board for students to review together._
