# The Associative Property
 

- The @vocab{Associative Property} of Addition tells us that no matter how we group numbers being added, the end result will always be the same.
- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/assoc-prop-launch.adoc}, where you will explore the Associative Property of Addition. In particular, you will explore different ways to re-group and re-order this expression: @math{88 + 637 + 71 + 129 + 12} 

<!--
Allow students to work, encouraging them to try not only different groupings but different _structures_ as well - all of which will produce the same outcome! If possible, invite students to draw their Circles of Evaluation on the board so that the class can see all possible configurations. After students have drawn their Circles of Evaluation and had some time to consider the reflection questions, follow up with a class discussion.

- Which Circle of Evaluation seemed like it would be the most difficult to solve in your head? Why?
- Which Circle of Evaluation seemed like it would be the easiest to solve in your head? Why?
- Did you think that any Circles of Evaluation were _equally_ easy or difficult to evaluate? What was going on in those Circles of Evaluation?

<!--
Students who applied the Commutative Property - merely changing the order of two numbers in the same group - would encounter Circles of Evaluation that were equally easy / challenging to evaluate.

# The Associative Property

- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/discover-assoc.adoc}. Look at the first problem.
- What do you Notice about the three Circles of Evaluation? How about the two expressions that accompany them? What do you Wonder?

As students complete the first page, instruct them to move on to "Discovery the Associative Property (2)" .

# The Associative Property

The Associative Property holds for addition and multiplication, but not division or subtraction.

# The Associative Property

- On @printable-exercise{pages/assoc-prop-table.adoc}, apply the Associative Property to create @vocab{equivalent} Circles of Evaluation. Pay attention to the operators!
- Now try @printable-exercise{pages/true-or-false.adoc}. Determine if each equation is true, and be sure to explain your response.

<!--
Follow up to confirm understanding of the activities, paying specific attention to expressions with multiple operations. In these instances, students _can_ apply the Associative Property - but only on the parts of the expression that feature only addition or only multiplication.

# The Associative Property


- For which operations does the Associative Property hold?
- Can you ever apply the Associative Property on an expression that includes division or subtraction?
- When applying the Associative Property, did you ever change the order of the numbers?
- When applying the Associative Property, did you ever change the architecture of the circles? When was that necessary? Why?

<!--
- For which operations does the Associative Property hold?
** _The Associative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not division or subtraction._
- Can you ever apply the Associative Property on an expression that includes division or subtraction?
** _Yes. If the expression *also* includes addition or multiplication, there might be an opportunity to change the groupings without changing the value of the expression._
- When applying the Associative Property, did you ever change the order of the numbers?
** _Yes, students will change the numbers' order throughout the lesson._
- When applying the Associative Property, did you ever change the architecture of the circles? (For instance, did you ever change “three nested circles” to “two-circles-in-a-circle”?) When was that necessary? Why?
** _Yes, sometimes to change the groupings, we also changed the structure of the expression._

# The Associative Property & Mental Math

- Think of an addition or multiplication problem that _appears_ to be very challenging, but is _much_ easier to solve after applying the Associative Property. Write it down on a piece of paper. Try to be creative!
- Trade papers with a partner. How do your problems compare?
- Turn your paper in to your teacher.

<!--
We encourage you to review students' submissions, and write a few on the board to discuss as a class. We want to sharpen students' eyes and help them develop the ability to spot instances when they might apply the Associative Property in any context.

# The Associative Property & Mental Math

Complete @printable-exercise{pages/which-grouping-makes-the-comp-easier.adoc}. Examine each Circle of Evaluation and put a check mark by the one that results in a simpler computation. Then, evaluate the expression. The first problem is below.

- Now, try @printable-exercise{pages/props-make-comp-easier.adoc} to apply the Associative Property to expressions with more numbers and varying operators.
- Try @printable-exercise{pages/props-make-comp-easier-challenge.adoc} to apply the Associative Property to expressions with fractions and decimals.

- How can the Associative Property help you do mental math more efficiently?
- How are the Commutative and Associative Properties similar? How are they different?
