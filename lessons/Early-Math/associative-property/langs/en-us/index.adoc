| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Recognize that, no matter how we group numbers being either added or multiplied, the end result will always be the same.
* Demonstrate their understanding of the Associative Property via Circles of Evaluation, numeric expressions, and words.

| Student-facing Lesson Goals

* Let's explore the Associative Property via Circles of Evaluation.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* The Associative Property - like other laws of arithmetic that students will encounter - is more meaningful and memorable when students view it as a powerful tool to help them to do math efficiently.

== The Associative Property @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students analyze pairs of Circles of Evaluation to see if they represent equivalent expressions. The Circles of Evaluation make visible the structural changes that occur when we apply the Associative Property.

=== Launch

When asked to multiply @math{2 \times 17 \times 5}, the student who notices that @math{2 \times 5 = 10} will arrive at a result much more efficiently than a student who does not. This is the power of the @vocab{Associative Property}!

In the short term, familiarity with the Associative Property enables students to make mental computations more efficiently. In the long term, comfort with this law of arithmetic (and otheres!) will provide a strong foundation for more complex algebraic reasoning.

A note: We view the Associative Property as "the Commutative Property 2.0"! Students can not only change the order of the values in an expression with addition or multiplication - they can change the _groupings_! As students will discover in this lesson's opening activity, finding the best groupings sometimes requires changing the order as well.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{assoc-prop-launch.adoc}.
- Look at the expression at the top of the page: @math{88 + 71 + 637 + 129 + 12}
- Now, create equivalent Circles of Evaluation by changing the order and the groupings of the numbers.
- As you complete the circles, strive for groupings that will make the computation simpler.

Allow students to work, encouraging them to try not only different groupings but different _structures_ as well - all of which will produce the same outcome! If possible, invite students to draw their Circles of Evaluation on the board, so that the class can see all possible Circles. After students have drawn their Circles of Evaluation and had some time to consider the reflection questions, follow-up with a class discussion.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Which Circle of Evaluation seemed like it would be the most difficult to solve in your head? Why?
- Which Circle of Evaluation seemed like it would be the easiest to solve in your head? Why?
- Did you think that any Circles of Evaluation were _equally_ easy or difficult to evaluate? What was going on in those Circles of Evaluation?
** _Students who applied the Commutative Property - merely changing the order of two numbers in the same group - would encounter Circles of Evaluation that were equally easy / challenging to evaluate._


=== Investigate

Explain to students that they have just demonstrated some mastery of the @vocab{Associative Property} of Addition!

Let's continue to explore the impact of changing the _groupings_ of an @vocab{arithmetic expression} to get a sense of when we can and cannot use the Associative Property.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{discover-assoc.adoc}. Look at the first problem. What do you Notice about the two Circles of Evaluation? How about the two expressions that accompany them? What do you Wonder?
- Work through the remaining problems with your partner. Be sure to evaluate the circles to confirm if they produce equivalent outcomes. When you're finished, move on to @printable-exercise{discover-assoc-cont.adoc}.
- What did you observe about the Associative Property?
- Now try @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}. If the equation is true, explain how you know. If it is false, explain what you would need to change to make it true.

=== Synthesize

- For which operations does the Associative Property hold?
** _The Associative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not division or subtraction._
- When applying the Associative Property, did you ever change the architecture of the circles? (For instance, did you ever change “three nested circles” to “two-circles-in-a-circle”?) When was that necessary? Why?
** _Yes, sometimes to change the groupings, we also changed the structure of the expression._

== The Associative Property and Mental Math @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students continue to explore how the Associative Property and Circles of Evaluation make mental computation simpler.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Think of an addition or multiplication problem that _appears_ to be very challenging, but is _much_ easier to solve after applying the Associative Property. Write it down on a piece of paper. Try to be creative!
- Trade papers with your neighbor. How do your problems compare?
- Turn your paper in to your teacher.

We encourage you to write a few student submissions on the board to discuss as a class. We want to sharpen students' eyes and help them develop the ability to spot instances when they might apply the Associative Property.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{which-circles-make-the-math-easier.adoc}. Examine each Circle of Evaluation and put a check mark by the one that results in a simpler computation. Then, evaluate the Circle.
- Now, try @printable-exercise{props-make-comp-easier.adoc} to apply the Associative Property to more complex expressions.
- For a challenge, try @printable-exercise{props-make-comp-easier-challenge.adoc}, which includes fractions and decimals.

=== Synthesize

How can the Associative Property help you do mental math more efficiently?

How are the Commutative and Associative Properties similar? How are they different?
