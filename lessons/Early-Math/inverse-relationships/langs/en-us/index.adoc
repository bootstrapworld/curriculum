* Recognize that dividing by @math{x} is the same as multiplying by @math{\frac{1}{x}}.
* Acknowledge _flexibility_ in the Order of Operations.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* This lesson is all about __mathematical flexibility__, and may challenge preexisting ideas about arithmetic. For students who've had a mostly procedural introduction to mathematics - or who have high math anxiety - the flexibility introduced by this lesson can be intimidating!
* Embrace an open mind and expect the same of your students, and be attentive to their emotional response as the lesson progresses. If students are getting anxious, they will not be able to concentrate and focus on the content.
* This lesson digs into multiplication and division of unit fractions and whole numbers. Review content as needed prior to instruction.

== The Multiplicative Inverse Property @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students explore the inverse relationship between multiplication and division.

=== Launch

We’ve learned that the Commutative and Associative Properties apply for expressions involving only multiplication or only addition. But what if there was a way to _rewrite_ division as multiplication? Then we could apply the Commutative and Associative Properties to all sorts of expressions. Imagine the possibilities! Let’s explore this idea.

But first, let's play a game. Draw a two-column table on the board to record response. Label the left-hand side "Starting Value," and label the right-hand side "?"

[.lesson-instruction]
- I'm going to give you a number. I'll put it in this left-hand column, here.
- You are going to tell me what value I should _multiply_ that number by to get a product of 1. I'll record your response in this right-hand column, here.
- The first number is @math{\frac{1}{2}}. What do I need to multiply @math{\frac{1}{2}} to get 1?
- The next number is @math{\frac{1}{3}}. What do I need to multiply @math{\frac{1}{3}} to get 1?
- How about @math{\frac{1}{100}}?
- Can someone offer me another pair of numbers - a fraction and a whole number - that we can multiply together to get 1?
** _Allow a variety of students to share. Record responses on the table._
- How about if I give you the number 20 in the left-hand column. What goes in the right-hand column?

Explain to students that the right-hand column represents the @vocab{reciprocal}, also referred to as the @vocab{multiplicative inverse}. Multiplying a number by its reciprocal always gives you one.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{reciprocals-practice.adoc}.
- In the first section, practice finding reciprocals and write them in the space provided.
- In the second section, fill in the missing number to complet the equations. We've included some equations in mathematical notation, and some as Circles of Evaluation!

=== Investigate

Now that we understand what a reciprocal is, we are ready to think about ways that it can make our life easier!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{discover-inverse.adoc}.
- What did you observe about the multiplicative inverse and its value when doing mental computation?

Emphasize to students the main ideas that should have emerged during this exploration:

- Rather than dividing by x, we can multiply by @math{\frac{1}{x}} to get the same result
- Rather than dividing by @math{\frac{1}{x}}, we can multiply by x to get the same result.

In the subsequent activities, students will continue their exploration of multiplication as the inverse of division, while also integrating and applying their knowledge of the Commutative and Associative Properties of Multiplication.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}.
- Complete @printable-exercise{wodb.adoc}.

Invite students to share which problems were most challenging on the two workbook pages, and which ones felt simple. Have students share strategies for determining equivalence.

=== Synthesize

- Claire and Soraya want to write an equivalent expression for @math{45 \div 9}. Claire studies the expression and announces that, because it involves division, the Commutative Property cannot be applied. Is she correct?
- Soraya grabs a pencil and writes the following: @math{45 \times \frac{1}{9}}. She says, "There! I fixed it. Now we can apply the Commutative Property." Explain what Soraya did. Is she correct?

== Is the Order of Operations Universal!? @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students examine an algorithm taught in Kenya and consider how and why it differs from what they might have learned previously.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Consider this expression: @math{100 \times 20 \div 5}
- What do we get when we simplify it to a single value?
** _400_
- How did you arrive at your answer?

Invite students to share their responses. If your students have spent any time at all studying the order of operations, they will most likely notice that the expression includes both multiplication and division. From there, they will most likely conclude that they must work from left to right to arrive at a correct result. This solving strategy can be represented by the Circle of Evaluation, below.

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(/ (* 100 20) 5))}

If there is a brave student who opted to divide _before_ multiplying, invite them to share their method and then ask other students to weigh in. If all students worked left to right, ask students to evaluate the Circle of Evaluation below and then assess if it is equivalent to the Circle of Evaluation, above. (Spoiler alert: It is!)

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(* 100 (/ 20 5)))}

We’ve learned that the Associative Property applies for expressions with only multiplication... not multiplication _and_ division. Many of us have also learned that when an expression includes multiplication and division, we must work from left to right. *So… what’s going on!?*

=== Investigate

In Kenya, students are actually taught that, when confronted with an expression like @math{100 \times 20 \div 5}, they must divide first... and then multiply! But does it actually work, _every_ time? Let’s investigate.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{divide-first-or-left-to-right.adoc}.
- There, you will test out the "Kenya algorithm" on several different expressions to see if dividing and then multiplying produces the correct result every time.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
- Can you make any connections to the first half of this lesson, when we discussed multiplication and division as inverse relationships?
** _We can rewrite any division expression as multiplication by the reciprocal. Once we transform a division expression into a multiplication expression, we can apply the Commutative and Associative Properties freely!_

Encourage students to think deeply about why this algorithm works – and if you’d like, invite them to consider and discuss why students all across the country are typically taught just one algorithm when, typically, there are an abundance to choose from!

=== Synthesize

- Do you think the Order of Operations is universal? Why or why not?
_Yes, there is a basic agreed upon order across countries, but numerous differences exist within tiers and how they are described._
- Can you think of any other examples - they can be math-related or not! - of when you thought there was just one way to do something... and then learned that you were wrong?
