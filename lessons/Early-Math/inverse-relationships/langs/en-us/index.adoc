== Inverse Relationships @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students explore the inverse relationship between multiplication and division.

=== Launch

We’ve learned that the Commutative and Associative Properties apply for expressions involving only multiplication or only addition. But what if there was a way to _rewrite_ division as multiplication? Then we could apply the Commutative and Associative Properties to all sorts of expressions. Imagine the possibilities! Let’s explore this idea.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{discover-inverse.adoc}.
- What did you observe about the relationship between multiplication and division?

Emphasize to students the main ideas that should have emerged during this exploration:

[.lesson-point]
--
- Rather than dividing by x, we can multiply by @math{\frac{1}{x}} to get the same result
- Rather than dividing by @math{\frac{1}{x}}, we can multiply by x to get the same result.
--


=== Investigate

In the subsequent activities, students will continue their exploration of multiplication as the inverse of division, while also integrating and applying their knowledge of the Commutative and Associative Properties of Multiplication.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}.
- Complete @printable-exercise{wodb.adoc}.

Invite students to share which problems were most challenging on the two workbook pages, and which ones felt simple. Have students share strategies for determining equivalence.

=== Synthesize

- Claire and Soraya want to write an equivalent expression for @math{45 \div 9}. Claire studies the expression and announces that, because it involves division, the Commutative Property cannot be applied. Is she correct?
- Soraya grabs a pencil and writes the following: @math{45 \times \frac{1}{9}}. She says, "There! I fixed it. Now we can apply the Commutative Property." Explain what Soraya did. Is she correct?

== Is the Order of Operations Universal!? @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students examine an algorithm taught in Kenya and consider how and why it differs from what they might have learned previously.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Consider this expression: @math{100 \times 20 \div 5}
- What do we get when we simplify it to a single value?
** _400_
- How did you arrive at your answer?

Invite students to share their responses. If your students have spent any time at all studying the order of operations, they will most likely notice that the expression includes both multiplication and division. From there, they will most likely conclude that they must work from left to right to arrive at a correct result. This solving strategy can be represented by the Circle of Evaluation, below.

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(/ (* 100 20) 5))}

If there is a brave student who opted to divide _before_ multiplying, invite them to share their method and then ask other students to weigh in. If all students worked left to right, ask students to evaluate the Circle of Evaluation below and then assess if it is equivalent to the Circle of Evaluation, above. (Spoiler alert: It is!)

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(* 100 (/ 20 5)))}

We’ve learned that the Associative Property applies for expressions with only multiplication... not multiplication _and_ division. Many of us have also learned that when an expression includes multiplication and division, we must work from left to right. *So… what’s going on!?*

=== Investigate

In Kenya, students are actually taught that, when confronted with an expression like @math{100 \times 20 \div 5}, they must divide first... and then multiply! But does it actually work, _every_ time? Let’s investigate.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{divide-first-or-left-to-right.adoc}.
- There, you will test out the "Kenya algorithm" on several different expressions to see if dividing and then multiplying produces the correct result every time.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
- Can you make any connections to the first half of this lesson, when we discussed multiplication and division as inverse relationships?
** _We can rewrite any division expression as multiplication by the reciprocal. Once we transform a division expression into a multiplication expression, we can apply the Commutative and Associative Properties freely!_

Encourage students to think deeply about why this algorithm works – and if you’d like, invite them to consider and discuss why students all across the country are typically taught just one algorithm when, typically, there are an abundance to choose from!

=== Synthesize

- Do you think the Order of Operations is universal? Why or why not?
_Yes, there is a basic agreed upon order across countries, but numerous differences exist within tiers and how they are described._
- Can you think of any other examples - they can be math-related or not! - of when you thought there was just one way to do something... and then learned that you were wrong?
