@n Under each Circle of Evaluation, write the equivalent arithmetic expression.

@n What will the first Circle evaluate to? @fitb{5em}{5} @hspace{5em} The second Circle? @fitb{5em}{5}

@n What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both expressions evaluate to 5. One has multiplication and one has division. One has 4 and one has @math{\frac{1}{4}}}}

@center{**Did you know that multiplying by @math{\frac{1}{4}} is the same as dividing by @math{4}?**}

@n In the table below, draw another pair of Circles to demonstrate how _multiplying a fraction_ produces the same result as _dividing by its reciprocal._ Then write the equivalent arithmetic expression for each of your Circles.
