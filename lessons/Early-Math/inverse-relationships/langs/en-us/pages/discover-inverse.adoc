@n Take a look at the two Circles of Evaluation below.

[.FillVerticalSpace, cols="^.^3,^.^3"]

|@show{(coe '(/ 20 4))} | @show{(coe  '(* 20 1/4))}
| @ifnotsoln{@math{20 \div 4 = ?}} @ifsoln{@math{20 \div 4 = 5}} | @ifnotsoln{@math{20 \times \frac{1}{4} = ?}}  @ifsoln{@math{20 \times \frac{1}{4} = 5}}

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both expressions evaluate to 5. One has multiplication and one has division. One has 4 and one has @math{\frac{1}{4}}}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

Did you know that dividing by @math{4} is the same as multiplying by @math{\frac{1}{4}} ? Let's explore other division expressions and see if we can transform them similarly.

Below, draw another pair of Circles tp demonstrates how _dividing by a whole number_ produces the same result as _multiplying by its reciprocal._

@n Examine the Circles of Evaluation below.

|@show{(coe '(/ 20 1/4))}  | @show{(coe  '(* 20 4))}
| @ifnotsoln{@math{20 \div \frac{1}{4} = ?}} @ifsoln{@math{20 \div \frac{1}{4} = 80}}  | @ifnotsoln{@math{20 \times 4 = ?}} @ifsoln{@math{20 \times 4 = 80}}
|===

How is this pair of Circles similar to the first pair on this page? How is it different? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The same values are being used, but this time we are dividing by the fraction,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{rather than dividing by the whole number. As a result, we get a larger outcome.}}

@vspace{1ex}

Draw another example like the one above to show how dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

|@showsoln{(coe '(/ 10 1/2))} | @showsoln{(coe  '(* 20 2))}
| @ifsoln{@math{10 \div \frac{1}{2} = 20}}| @ifsoln{@math{20 \times 2 = 20}}
