== Exponent Expressions with Negatives @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students use Circles of Evaluation to visualize expressions with @vocab{exponents} and negatives.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Examine the two exponent expressions and their Circles of Evaluation, below.

[.embedded, cols="^.^1,^.^1", grid="none", stripes="none", frame="none"]
|===
| @math{-(3^2)}
| @math{(-3)^2}
| @show{(coe  '(negate (expt 3 2)))}
| @show{(coe  '(expt (negate 3) 2))}
|===

- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible Noticings: One expression is negative, the other is positive. Both expressions have one Circle inside another Circle._
** _Possible Wonderings: Will I always get a negative outcome if there are no parentheses? Will I always get a positive outcome if there are parentheses?_
- @math{-3^2} has the *same* Circle of Evaluation as one of the expressions, above? Which expression do you think is equivalent to @math{-3^2}?
** _Student responses will vary. The Circle of Evaluation on the right is equivalent._

=== Investigate

In the following activity, students will apply exponents in two different types of contexts: (1) instances where they apply the exponent to a _negative value_, and (2) instances where they negate _after_ applying the exponent. Circles of Evaluation will help students to visualize the difference between these two scenarios.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}, draw two Circles of Evaluation two represent each equation. Then, use your Circles of Evaluation to determine if the equation is true or false. The first one is done for you.
- When you're finished, look over your work to see what patterns you notice and then respond to the questions at the bottom of the page.

=== Synthesize

- An exponent expression has a negative base _inside_ parentheses. Which do we apply first: `expt` or `negate`?
** _First, we apply `negate`, then `expt`._
- An exponent expression has a negative base and no grouping symbols. Which do we apply first: `expt` or
`negate`?
** _First, we apply `expt`, then `negate`._
- Why were _some_ of the equations on the workbook page true, but not all of them?
** _Possible response: Exponent expressions with negatives but no grouping symbols were always negative, because the negation came last. Exponent expressions with grouping symbols were sometimes negative and sometimes positive, depending on how many times we multiplied the base by itself._

== Variable Exponent Expressions with Negatives @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students extend their knowledge of Circles of Evalution to evaluate expressions with @vocab{variables}, exponents, and negatives.

=== Launch

Invite students to consider the role of variables in expressions with negatives and exponents by facilitating a discussion using the prompts below.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Is @math{-m} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.
** _If the value of @math{m} is negative, then @math{-m} is positive. If the value of @math{m} is positive, then @math{-m} is negative. So, @math{-m} can be positive, negative, or zero._
- Is @math{-m^2} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.
** _First we apply the exponent, then we negate. The outcome is always negative (unless @math{m} is zero)._

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- On @printable-exercise{evaluate-twice.adoc}, create a Circle of Evaluation for each expression provided. Once you have drawn a Circle of Evaluation, use it to help you evaluate the expression __twice__ - once for @math{x=5} and once for @math{x=âˆ’5}.
- When did the expressions produce the same outcome for both @math{x=5} and @math{x=-5}?
** _The expressions produced the same outcome for 1 and 2, the expressions that involved squaring rather than cubing._
- When you're done, turn to @printable-exercise{exponents-variables-table.adoc}. Draw a Circle of Evaluation to represent the expression, then evaluate using the assigned value.


=== Synthesize

Was it more challenging to work with _algebraic_ exponent expressions (with variables) than it was to work with numeric exponent expressions? Why or why not?
