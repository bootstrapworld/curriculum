# Exponents and Negation
 
Examine the two exponent expressions and their Circles of Evaluation, below. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@image{images/coes1.png}

<!--
** _Possible Noticings: One expression is negative, the other is positive. Both expressions have one Circle inside another Circle._
** _Possible Wonderings: Will I always get a negative outcome if there are no parentheses? Will I always get a positive outcome if there are parentheses?_

# Exponents and Negation

Did you know that @math{-3^2} has the *same* Circle of Evaluation as one of the expressions, below? Which expression do you think is equivalent to @math{-3^2}?

<!--
** _Student responses will vary. The Circle of Evaluation on the right is equivalent._

# Exponents and Negation

On @printable-exercise{pages/true-or-false.adoc}, draw two Circles of Evaluation to represent each equation. Then, use your Circles of Evaluation to determine if the equation is true or false. The first one (below) is done for you.

# Exponents and Negation

- An exponent expression has a negative base _inside_ parentheses. Which do we apply first: `expt` or `negate`?
- An exponent expression has a negative base and no grouping symbols. Which do we apply first: `expt` or
`negate`?
- Why were _some_ of the equations on the workbook page true, but not all of them?

** _First, we apply `negate`, then `expt`._

** _First, we apply `expt`, then `negate`._
- Why were _some_ of the equations on the workbook page true, but not all of them?
** _Possible response: Exponent expressions with negatives but no grouping symbols were always negative, because the negation came last. Exponent expressions with grouping symbols were sometimes negative and sometimes positive, depending on how many times we multiplied the base by itself._

# Variables, Exponents & Negation

- Is @math{-m} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.
- Is @math{-m^2} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.

<!--
- Is @math{-m} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.
** _If the value of @math{m} is negative, then @math{-m} is positive. If the value of @math{m} is positive, then @math{-m} is negative. So, @math{-m} can be positive, negative, or zero._
- Is @math{-m^2} sometimes, never, or always negative? Explain your response.
** _First we apply the exponent, then we negate. The outcome is always negative (unless @math{m} is zero)._

# Variables, Exponents & Negation

Study the three Circles of Evaluation, below. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

# Variables, Exponents & Negation

Write an algebraic expression to correspond with each Circle of Evaluation.

@image{images/coes2.png}

<!--
The first Circle is @math{x^2}; the second Circle is @math{-x^2}; the third Circle is @math{(-x)^2}.

# Variables, Exponents & Negation

On @printable-exercise{pages/evaluate-twice.adoc}, create a Circle of Evaluation for each expression provided. Once you have drawn a Circle of Evaluation, use it to help you evaluate the expression __twice__ - once for @math{x=5} and once for @math{x=âˆ’5}.

# Variables, Exponents & Negation

When did the expressions produce the same outcome for both @math{x=5} and @math{x=-5}?

<!--
_The expressions produced the same outcome for 1 and 2, the expressions that involved squaring rather than cubing._

# Variables, Exponents & Negation

When you're done, turn to @printable-exercise{pages/exponents-variables-table.adoc}. Draw a Circle of Evaluation to represent the expression, then evaluate using the assigned value.

# Variables, Exponents & Negation

Was it more challenging to work with _algebraic_ exponent expressions (with variables) than it was to work with numeric exponent expressions? 

Why or why not?
