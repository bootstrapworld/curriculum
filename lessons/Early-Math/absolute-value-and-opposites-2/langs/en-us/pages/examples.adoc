== m = 6

@n On the table above, place a checkmark in the `m = 6` column by each of the examples that you *predict* will pass when you click "Run".

@n Open the @starter-file{negation-2} and click "Run". @ifproglang{pyret}{Select "Show Details" to the right of `examples-block-1`.} Using the information provided, fill in as many of the blanks as needed below to describe the examples that failed.

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{1}} failed because @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The left side was -6. The right side was 6.}}

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{3}} failed because @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The left side was -6. The right side was 6.}}

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{5}} failed because @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The left side was 6. The right side was -6.}}


@n Talia says that setting `m` equal to _any_ positive value will produce the same results. In other words, she thinks that the *same tests* will fail if `m > 0`? Do you agree? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. All positive values will produce the same result.}}

@n Try out some other *positive* values for `m` by editing line 5. Was your prediction correct? Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

== m = -12

@n Repeat the process above, this time placing checkmarks in the `m = -12` column by the examples that you *predict* will pass when you set `m` equal to `-12`. After predicting, click "Run" to test and report on your results.

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{2}} failed because @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The left side was 12. The right side was -12.}}

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{4}} failed because @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The left side was 12. The right side was -12.}}

@hspace{2em} Test # @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{5}} failed because @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The left side was 12. The right side was -12.}}

@n Try out some other *negative* values for `m` by editing line 5. What do you observe? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}


== Reflect

@n Repeat the process above, this time placing checkmarks in the `m = 0` column by the examples that you *predict* will pass when you set `m` equal to `0`. After predicting, click "Run" to test and report on your results. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{All tests passed.}}

@n Which equations in the @proglang file are *always* true? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{None of them!}}

@n Which equations in the @proglang file are *always* false? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The last one!}}
