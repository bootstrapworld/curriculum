| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Students translate expressions with absolute value and opposite, using Circles, words and symbols.
* Students analyze equivalence in pairs of Circles with absolute value and equivalence.
* Students compute the result of expressions with absolute value and opposite.

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's use Circles of Evaluation to about opposites and absolute value in combination.

| Preparation
|
* This activity involves a card sort. The easiest way to prepare for this is to give each pair of students an envelope containing the three sets of cards. Keep each set together with rubber bands or paperclips.

== Translating with Absolute Value & Opposite @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students match Circles of Evaluation to expressions in words with absolute value and opposite, and then they consider how mathematical expressions correspond to those two representations.

=== Launch

Explain to students that they are going to receive @printable-exercise{three-sets-cards.adoc, three sets of cards}.

The first set of cards includes Circles of Evaluation that use the `negate` and `num-abs` functions.

The second set of cards translates those expressions into words.

[.lesson-instruction]
- With your partner, match each Circle card with the corresponding Words card.
- Lay them out on the table in front of you so you can clearly see both the Circle and the Words.
- Some Circles have more than one translation into words.
- Discuss each match that you make.

Circulate as students sort their cards, ensuring that they are carefully analyzing each card so that they see the connection between the Circle of Evaluation and its translation into words. Students will need to consider if translating the Circle into words involves reading from the outside-in or the inside-out.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, you’re going to receive a third set of cards - Mathematical Expressions.
- One at a time, take turns analyzing each of these cards. After examining it closely, place it with the appropriate Circle / Words pairing.
- Explain to your partner how and why you placed each card.
- You and your partner must agree on each card’s placement before advancing to the next.

Again, circulate during the activity. As students match expressions in words to their arithmetic expressions and Circles, invite them to use the Circle as a tool to help them translate to the other representations.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Each row on @printable-exercise{translating-abs-val-opp.adoc} represents a single arithmetic expression, written in three different forms. Sometimes, you will be provided with a Circle to translate, other times you will start with words or a mathematical expression.
-  Fill in the empty spaces so that all three forms represent the same expression.
- *MAYBE SHOULD ALSO ADD A WORDS-TO-CIRCLES MATCHING ACTIVITY LIKE IN TRANSLATING LESSON*

=== Synthesize

Here are some key take-aways from this lesson:

- `negate` Circles can contain `num-abs` Circles.

- `num-abs` Circles can contain `negate` Circles.

- We can read the Circles outside-in or inside out when translating into words, depending on which translation we choose.

- We can also translate our Circles and expressions in words into mathematical expressions.

And here is a question to consider:

- We did lots of different translations between Circles, expressions in words, and mathematical expressions. Was there any type of translation that was more challenging for you?



== Evaluating with Absolute Value & Opposite @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students tackle evaluating expressions that include both `num-abs` _and_ `negate`.

=== Launch

Circles can be extremely useful in helping students to navigate problems with `num-abs` and `negate`, which can be quite complicated, otherwise; after all, "negative" and "absolute value" are not typically delegated in the order of operations.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Analyze the equation below and consider if it is *true* or *false*:

@math{-|4| = |-4|}

Jenny says that it is _true_ because absolute value makes everything positive, so both sides of the equation evaluate to 4. Is she correct?
--

Representing the equation with Circles highlights the structure of these expressions and it becomes clearer that they are not equivalent.

|===
| @show{(coe '(negate (num-abs 4)))} | @math{=} | @show{(coe '(num-abs (negate 4)))}
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc} to analyze additional pairs of Circles that use both `negate` and `num-abs`.
- Evaluate each side of the equation to confirm your response.
- The first one is done for you.

=== Investigate

Students who  can toggle between the mathematical representation, the expression in words, and the Circle of Evaluation will feel more confident both completing and discussing the subsequent activities.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Analyze Circles to determine @printable-exercise{wodb-abs-val-negate.adoc}. The worksheet starts with numeric values and then integrates variables. Place a check mark by each Circle that meets the condition stated on the left.
- Next, try @printable-exercise{expression-to-circles-matching.adoc}


=== Synthesize

How do you decide the order in which to apply absolute value and opposite when an expression includes both?
