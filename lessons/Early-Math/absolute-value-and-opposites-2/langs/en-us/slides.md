# Translating Absolute Value & Opposite

You are going to receive @printable-exercise{three-sets-cards.adoc, three sets of cards}.

The first set of cards includes Circles of Evaluation that use the `negate` and `abs` functions.

The second set of cards translates those Circles of Evaluation into Verbal Expressions.

# Translating Absolute Value & Opposite

- With your partner, match each Circle of Evaluation card with the corresponding Verbal Expressions card.
- Lay them out on the table in front of you so you can clearly see both the Circle of Evaluation and the Words.
- Some Circles of Evaluation have more than one translation into words.
- Discuss each match that you make.

<!--
Circulate as students sort their cards, ensuring that they are carefully examine each card in order to see the connection between the Circle of Evaluation and its translation into words. Students will need to consider if translating the Circle of Evaluation into words involves reading from the outside-in or the inside-out.

# Translating Absolute Value & Opposite

- Now, you’re going to receive a third set of cards - Mathematical Expressions.
- One at a time, take turns analyzing each of these cards. After examining it closely, place it with the appropriate Circle of Evaluation / Verbal Expression pairing.
- Explain to your partner how and why you placed each card.
- You and your partner must agree on each card’s placement before advancing to the next.

<!--
Again, circulate during the activity. As students match Verbal Expressions to their Mathematical Expressions and Circles of Evaluation, invite them to use the Circle of Evaluation as a tool to help them see the structure of the math.

# Translating Absolute Value & Opposite

- Each row on @printable-exercise{translating-abs-val-opp.adoc} represents a single @vocab{arithmetic expression}, written in three different forms. Sometimes, you will be provided with a Circle to translate, other times you will start with a verbal or mathematical expression.
-  Fill in the empty spaces so that all three forms represent the same expression.

# Translating Absolute Value & Opposite

Here are some key take-aways from this lesson:

- We can find the @vocab{opposite} of an @vocab{absolute value}: @math{- | x |}
- We can find the @vocab{absolute value} of an @vocab{opposite}: @math{ |- x |}
- Thinking about the structure of the expression can help us understand if it is positive or negative.

# Translating Absolute Value & Opposite

Here is a question to consider:

We did lots of different translations between Circles of Evaluation, verbal expressions, and mathematical expressions. Was there any type of translation that was more challenging for you?

# Evaluating Absolute Value & Opposite


- Consider this @vocab{equation}: @math{-|4| = |-4|}
- Is it *true* or *false*?
- Jenny says that the equation is _true_ because @vocab{absolute value} makes everything positive, so both sides of the equation evaluate to 4. Is she correct?

<!--
** _Jenny is not correct - although students commonly assume that the presence of absolute value indicates a positive outcome._

# Evaluating Absolute Value & Opposite

Representing the equation @math{-|4| = |-4|} with Circles of Evaluation highlights the structure of these expressions and it becomes clearer that they are not @vocab{equivalent}.

# Evaluating Absolute Value & Opposite

- Turn to @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc} to examine additional pairs of Circles of Evaluation that use both `negate` and `abs`.
- Are the expressions on either side of the equal sign?
- Evaluate each side of the equation to confirm your response.
- The first one (below) is done for you.

# Evaluating Absolute Value & Opposite

Examine the Circles of Evaluation to determine @printable-exercise{wodb-abs-val-negate.adoc}. The workbook page starts with numeric values and then integrates @vocab{variables}. 

Place a check mark by each Circle of Evaluation that meets the condition stated on the left.

# Evaluating Absolute Value & Opposite

- Next, try @printable-exercise{matching-expression-to-circle.adoc}, where you will match expressions with their corresponding Circles of Evaluation. Note: some expressions can be matched to more than one correct Circle of Evaluation!
- At the bottom of the matching workbook page, respond to the open response questions, thinking carefully about each Circle of Evaluation that you encountered.

# Evaluating Absolute Value & Opposite

- How do you decide the order in which to apply absolute value and opposite when a mathematical expression includes both?

- Did you work from the inside-out or the outside-in when evaluating Circles of Evaluation with absolute value and opposite? Did your strategy change, depending on the Circle of Evaluation? Explain.
