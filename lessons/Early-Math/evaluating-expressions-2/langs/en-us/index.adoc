== Exponent Expressions with Negatives @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

Students apply Circles of Evaluation to analyze expressions with exponents and negatives, later extending their knowledge to evaluate expressions with variables, exponents, and negatives.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Analyze these expressions: @math{-3^2}, @math{(-3)^2}, and @math{-(3^2)}
- Are any of these three expressions equivalent? How do you know? Draw Circles to help you.
** _We know that in an expression with no grouping symbols, we evaluate the exponent first - before the negation. Therefore, the first and third expression are equivalent; they both evaluate to @math{-9}. The second expression evaluates to @math{9}. See Circles below._

=== Investigate

In the following activity, students will apply exponents in two different types of contexts: (1) instances where they negate _after_ applying the exponent, and (2) instances where they apply the exponent to a _negative value_. Circles will help students to visualize the difference between these two scenarios.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On @printable-exercise{true-or-false.adoc}, draw two Circles two represent each equation. Then, use your Circles to determine if the equation is true or false.
- When you're finished, look over your work to see what patterns you notice and then respond to the questions at the bottom of the page.

=== Synthesize

- If an expression has no grouping symbols, which do we apply first: `num-expt` or
`negate`?
** _First, we apply `num-expt`, then `negate`._
- If an exponent expression has a negative value inside parentheses, which do we apply first: `num-expt` or `negate`?
** _First, we apply `negate`, then `num-expt`._
- Why were only _some_ of the equations on the worksheet true, but not all of them?
** _Possible response: Exponent expressions with negatives but no grouping symbols were always negative, because the negation came last. Exponent expressions with grouping symbols were sometimes negative and sometimes positive, depending on how many times we multiplied the base by itself._

== Variable Exponent Expressions with Negatives @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview


=== Launch



=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at the three-column table on Variable Expressions with Exponents and Negatives.
- Either draw a Circle to match the expression, or write an expression to match the Circle.
- Once you have completely filled in the first and second column, move to the third column, where you will evaluate each expressions by substituting in the given value.
- Finally, try evaluating variable expressions with exponents and negatives on this worksheet.
