@n Hit "Run." A message appears that says, "Looks shipshape, all 4 tests passed, mate!"

@n Click "Show Details" on the right side of the green `examples-block-1` rectangle. Describe what you see. @fitb{}{}

@n In lines 4-5 of the Definitions Area (left side of the screen), change the variable definitions. This time, use `a = 6` and `b = 10`. What do you predict will happen when you hit "Run"? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Was your prediction correct? @fitb{5em}{} In your own words, explain what happened and why. If you need help, click "Show Details". @fitb{}{}

@n Give three additional pairs of values for `a` and `b` that will cause _both_ example 3 and example 4 to fail. Try them out!

@hspace{2em} a = @fitb{5em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{5em}{} @hspace{6em}
a = @fitb{5em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{5em}{} @hspace{6em}
a = @fitb{5em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{5em}{}

@n Are there any pairs of values for `a` and `b` that will cause example 1 or example 2 to fail? If so, list them here: @fitb{}{}

@n Are any of the examples are true *every time, no matter what values we use for a and b*? If so, which ones? @fitb{}{}

@n Are any of the examples true *some of the time, depending on what values we use for a and b*? @fitb{}{}

@n Maria says, "The Commutative Property applies for every operation. I know because sometimes I can change the order of the numbers being subtracted or divided and the result remains the same." Is she correct? Explain. @fitb{}{}
