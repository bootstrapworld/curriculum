= Variables and Code (Associative Property)

@n Open @starter-file{variables-code}. On the table below, record your Noticings and Wonderings about what you see there. Consider how this starter file is different from @starter-file{variables-code}. *Don't hit "Run" yet!*

@n Based on what you see in the Definitions Window (left side), predict what will happen when you hit "Run" by circling your choice below.

| Looks shipshape, all 4 tests passed, mate!

@n Click "Run". Were you correct? @fitb{5em}{} Explain. @fitb{}{}

@n Deena and Marcus want to edit the code in their Definitions Window so that when they hit "Run", all four tests pass. They each have a different idea.

- Marcus suggests changing the `true` in line 17 to say `false`.
- Deena thinks they should change the values of the variables.

Who do you agree with? (Before deciding, feel free to test out Marcus's idea and Deena's idea.) @fitb{10em}{} Explain. @fitb{}{}

@n Give four sets of values for `a`, `b` and `c` that will cause _both_ example 3 and example 4 to fail. Try them out!

a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{6em}
a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{2em}

a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{6em}
a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{2em}



@n Are there any pairs of values for `a` and `b` that will cause example 3 to fail, but not example 4? If so, list them here: @fitb{}{}


@n Are there any pairs of values for `a` and `b` that will cause example 1 or example 2 to fail? If so, list them here: @fitb{}{}

@n Are any of the examples true *every time, no matter what values we use for a and b*? If so, which ones? @fitb{}{}

@n Are any of the examples true *some of the time, depending on what values we use for a and b*? @fitb{}{}
