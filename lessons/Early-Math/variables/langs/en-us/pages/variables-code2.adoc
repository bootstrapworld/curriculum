= Variables and Code (Associative Property)

@n Open @starter-file{variables-code2}. On the table below, record your Noticings and Wonderings about what you see there. Consider how this starter file is different from @starter-file{variables-code}. *Don't hit "Run" yet!*

@n Based on what you see in the Definitions Window (left side), predict what will happen when you hit "Run" by circling your choice below.

| Looks shipshape, all 4 tests passed, mate!
| 3 tests passed, 1 test failed
| 2 tests passed, 2 tests failed
| 1 test passed, 3 tests failed

@n Explain how you made your prediction (above). @fitb{}{}

@n Click "Run". Were you correct? @fitb{5em}{} Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{After hitting "Run", we discover that 3 tests passed and 1 test (example 3) failed.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Test 3 fails because @math{(1 - 1) - 1}, which evaluates to -1, is not equivalent to @math{1 - (1 - 1)}, which evaluates to 0.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Give four sets of values for `a`, `b` and `c` that will cause _both_ example 3 and example 4 to fail. Try them out!

@hspace{1em} a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{6em}
a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{2em}

@hspace{1em} a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{6em}
a = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} b = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{1em} c = @fitb{2em}{} @hspace{2em}

@n Are there any sets of values for `a`, `b`, and `c` that will cause example 1 or example 2 to fail? If so, list them here: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@n Are any of the examples true *every time, no matter what values we use for a and b*? If so, which ones? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@n Are any of the examples true *some of the time, depending on what values we use for a and b*? If so, which ones? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes, examples 3 and 4.}}

@n Deena and Marcus want to edit the code of their starter file in their Definitions Window so that when they hit "Run", all four tests pass. They each have a different idea.

- Marcus suggests leaving a, b, and c how they are (equal to 1) and instead changing the `true` in line 17 to say `false`.
- Deena thinks they should change the values of the variables so that a, b, and c are each equal to zero.

Who do you agree with? _Before deciding, feel free to test out Marcus's idea and Deena's idea._ @fitb{10em}{} Explain. @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Marcus's idea will work, but Deena's will not. When we test Deena's idea, examples 1, 2, and 3 pass, but example 4 fails }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{because we cannot divide by zero.}}

@fitb{}{}

@star Janae dislikes Marcus's solution. She points to his code on line 17 and says, "This example is "false", so it has to be *wrong*. We can't leave it." How would you respond? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean-producing functions _should sometimes return false_! Just because an expression produces `false`}}

@fitb{}{does not mean that it is somehow _incorrect_.}
