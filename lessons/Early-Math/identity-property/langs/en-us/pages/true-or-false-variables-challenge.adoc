True or False? Explain


| @n
| @show{(coe '(/ (+ 0 (* m 1)) 1 ))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(* m (- 4 3)))}
| @ifsoln{True. In each Circle of Evaluation, the Identity Property is correctly applied to m.}


| @n
| @show{(coe '(* (+ g h) (/ 30 30)))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(* (+ h g) (/ 523 523)))}
| @ifsoln{True. The Commutative Property allows us to change the order in which we add g and h. In both Circles of Evaluation, the sum of g and h is multiplied by 1.}


| @n
| @show{(coe '(+ (* h (* t q)) 0))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(+ 0 (* q (* t h))))}
| @ifsoln{True. In both Circles of Evaluation, zero is being added to the product of h, t, and q. The Associative Property allows us adjust the grouping of h, t, and q.}



| @n
| @show{(coe '(+ (- f h) (- t t)))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(+ (- h f) (- k k)))}
| @ifsoln{False. Although zero is being added in both Circles of Evaluation, the Commutative Property does not hold for subtraction. If we changed subtraction to addition (so f + h = h + f), this would be true.}


| @n
| @show{(coe '(+ (+ g g) (- m m)))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(+ (* 2 g) (- 4.6 4.6)))}
| @ifsoln{True. The Identity Property is being applied. Both Circles of Evaluation are equal to g + g.}



| @n
| @show{(coe '(- 76.42 (- (* 5 k) (* 5 k))))}
@math{=}
@show{(coe '(- 76.42 (- (/ w 3) (/ 3 w))))}
| @ifsoln{False. Although the first Circle of Evaluation shows zero being subtracted from 76.42, we do not know what value is being subtracted from 76.42 in the second Circle of Evaluation.}
