@n Read each expression in words and translate it into a Circle of Evaluation.

| Find the sum of 12 and 4. | Find the sum of 12 and 4. Multiply it by 1. | Find the sum of 12 and 4. Add 0.

What do you notice? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{All three Circles evaluate to 16. We've multiplied the sum by one, and then we added zero.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both result in getting the same outcome.}}

Thes second and third Circles of Evaluation illustrate the Identity Property!

- The Identity Property of Multiplication tells us that the product of 1 and any number is that number.

- The Identity Property of Addition tells us that the sum of a number and zero is that number.

@n Take a look at the _counter-examples_ below.

Explain why each Circle of Evaluation above does *not* represent the Identity Property. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{When we multiply a number by zero, we always get zero.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Adding one to a number causes an increase in value.}}

@n Fill in the blank spaces below to create four unique representations of the Identity Property. Use each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) at least once.
