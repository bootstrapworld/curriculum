== The Identity Property

=== Overview

Students analyze pairs of Circles to see if they represent equivalent expressions. The Circles make visible the structural changes that occur when we apply the Identity Property.

=== Launch

Build on prior knowledge by reminding students of the activity that they completed in the previous lesson. You might even refer to the list of category names that the class created, and then draw students’ attention to any category names that allude to or suggest the commutativity. (Any mention of “changing the order” is a strong hint that students’ have clued into the Commutative Property!)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, turn to @printable-exercise{discover-identity.adoc}. Look at the first problem. Translate the expressions in words into Circles of Evaluation. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible responses: All three Circles include @math{12 + 4}. All three Circles evaluate to @math{16}._
- Complete the worksheet by filling in the blanks for the remaining Circles. Avoid putting the same operator more than once.
- Keisha says that when she multiplies a number by zero, she always gets that number. Do you agree?
** _No, multiplying by zero produces zero._
- What did you observe about the Identity Property?
** _Possible responses: I can multiply or divide by @math{1} and get an equivalent result. I can add or subtract @math{0} and get an equivalent result._

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{identity-prop-table.adoc}, filling in the blansk so that all of the Circles are equivalent.
- Then, analyze the Circles to decide @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong.adoc}? Be sure to explain why each Circle you select does not belong with the others.

As students explain why various Circles do not belong with the others, encourage them to practice using vocabulary that they have encountered already. For instance, @math{12} is _not_ equal to @math{0 - 12} because __the Commutative Property only holds for addition__. Although this example illustrates misuse of the Identity Propery (we can subtract zero from twelve, but not twelve from zero!), thinking about the Commutative Property can help students recognize what is going on.

=== Synthesize

- For which operations does the Identity Property hold?
** _To apply the Identity Property, we add or subtract zero, or we multiply or divide by one._
- Did you encounter any instances where the Identity Property was used in combination with another property?
** _Yes! The Identity Property can be used in combination with the other properties we've discussed to create equivalent Circles._


== The Identity Property and Variables @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students analyze equivalent expressions with variables, this time integrating their knowledge of the Identity Property.

=== Launch

We can represent the Identity Property with variables, in the same way that we could represent the Associative Property and the Commutative Property with variables. Here's an example:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(* (+ 3 q) 1))}
| @math{3 + q} 	| @math{=} | @math{(3 + q) \times 1}
|===

Or like this:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(+ 0 (+ 3 q)))}
| @math{3 + q} 			| @math{=} | @math{(3 + q) + 0}
|===

The Identity Property will hold no matter what values we substitute in for @math{q} or for @math{t}. Although computation can help us test equivalence, there's no way to test every possible value. The Identity Property lets us prove that these expressions are equivalent _even with variables_.

=== Investigate

As they did with the Commutative Property and the Associative Property, students now make the transition from numeric values to variables.

If students would like, they may choose values to represent the variables. Early finishers can substitute in numbers of their choosing to confirm that their analyses of the Circles are correct.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false-variables.adoc} using your knowledge of the Identity Property.
- Analyze the Circles to decide @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong-variables.adoc}. Be sure to explain your thinking.

=== Synthesize

- Did you use Computation to check your work? Or do you prefer thinking about properties and equivalence?
** _Student responses will vary._
- There is a version of the Identity Property for each of the four operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is *not* the case for the Commutative Property or the Associative Property. Why is this so? How is the Identity Property different from these other properties?
** _We do not actually change the structure of the orginal Circle when we apply the Identity Property - we simply nest it inside of another Circle, a Circle which represents adding/subtracting zero or multiplying/dividing by 1. When we applied the Commutative Property and Associative Property, we fundamentally altered the structure of the Circles._
