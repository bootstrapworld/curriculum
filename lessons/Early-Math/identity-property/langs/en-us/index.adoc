== The Identity Property

=== Overview

Students determine if pairs of Circles of Evaluation represent equivalent expressions. The Circles of Evaluation make visible the structural changes that occur when we apply the @vocab{Identity Property}.

=== Launch

Build on prior knowledge by reminding students of the category names that the class created, and then draw students’ attention to any category names that allude to or suggest some familiarity with the Identity Property. (Any mention of “multiplying by one” or "adding zero" is a strong hint that students’ have clued into the @vocab{Identity Property}!)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, turn to @printable-exercise{discover-identity.adoc}. Look at the first problem. Translate the verbal expressions into Circles of Evaluation. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible responses: All three Circles include @math{12 + 4}. All three Circles evaluate to @math{16}._
- Study the counter-examples in Q2. Explain why each Circle of Evaluation does *not* represent the Identity Property.
- Complete the page by filling in the blanks in Q3 so that the value of the Circles of Evaluation does not change.
- What did you observe about the Identity Property for division? Subtraction?
** _Possible responses: I can multiply or divide by @math{1} and get an equivalent result. I can add or subtract @math{0} and get an equivalent result. I need to remember that Commutativity does not apply for division and subtraction!_

Confirm that students understand the following main idea about the Identity Property:

[.lesson-point]
Multiplying or dividing an expression by 1 does not change its value; similarly, adding or subtracting 0 results in the original value.

Students will apply this knowledge throughout the lesson.

=== Investigate

Explain to students that they will sometimes encounter the Identity Property in more sneaky forms.

How does the Circle of Evaluation below illustrate the Identity Property?

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ 27 (- 8 8)))}

In the Circle above, _zero_ (or @math{8 - 8}) is being added to @math{27}!

Now, consider this equation, which is really a pair of equivalent fractions: @math{\frac{3}{4} = \frac{15}{20}}

When we find equivalent fractions, we _multiply by one_!In the example above, @math{\frac{3}{4}} was multiplied by @math{\frac{5}{5}} to get @math{\frac{15}{20}}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{identity-prop-table.adoc}, filling in the blanks so that all of the Circles of Evaluation are equivalent.
- Then, complete @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong.adoc}? Be sure to explain why each Circle of Evaluation you select does not belong with the others.

As students explain why various Circles of Evaluation do not belong with the others, encourage them to practice using vocabulary that they have encountered already.

=== Synthesize

- For which operations does the Identity Property hold?
** _To apply the Identity Property, we add or subtract zero, or we multiply or divide by one._
- Did you encounter any instances where the Identity Property was used in combination with another property?
** _Yes! The Identity Property can be used in combination with the other properties we've discussed to create equivalent Circles._


== The Identity Property and Variables @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students use their knowledge of the Identity Property to determine if @vocab{expressions} with variables are equivalent or not.

=== Launch

We can represent the Identity Property with @vocab{variables}, in the same way that we could represent the @vocab{Associative Property} and the @vocab{Commutative Property} with variables. Here's an example:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(* (+ 3 q) 1))}
| @math{3 + q} 	| @math{=} | @math{(3 + q) \times 1}
|===

Or like this:

[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
|@show{(coe '(+ 3 q))}	| @math{=} | @show{(coe '(+ 0 (+ 3 q)))}
| @math{3 + q} 			| @math{=} | @math{0 + (3 + q)}
|===

The Identity Property will hold no matter what values we substitute in for @math{q} or for @math{t}. Although computation can help us test equivalence, there's no way to test every possible value. The Identity Property lets us prove that these expressions are equivalent _even with variables_.

=== Investigate

As they did with the Commutative Property and the Associative Property, students now make the transition from numeric values to variables.

If students would like, they may choose values to represent the variables. Early finishers can substitute in numbers of their choosing to confirm that their analyses of the Circles of Evaluation are correct.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{true-or-false-variables.adoc} using your knowledge of the Identity Property to determine if the equation represented by the Circles of Evaluation is true or false.
- Examine the Circles of Evaluation to decide @printable-exercise{which-one-doesnt-belong-variables.adoc}. Be sure to explain your thinking.
- Optional: Try @opt-printable-exercise{true-or-false-variables-challenge.adoc}. Here, you will again decide if the equation represented by the Circles of Evaluation is true or false - but you will see more nested Circles... and you will need to apply your knowledge of the Associative Property and the Commutative Property as well!

=== Synthesize

- Did you use Computation to check your work? Or do you prefer thinking about properties and equivalence?
** _Student responses will vary._
- There is a version of the Identity Property for each of the four operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is *not* the case for the Commutative Property or the Associative Property. Why is this so? How is the Identity Property different from these other properties?
** _We do not actually change the structure of the original Circle of Evaluation when we apply the Identity Property - we simply nest it inside of another Circle, a Circle which represents adding/subtracting zero or multiplying/dividing by 1. When we applied the Commutative Property and Associative Property, we fundamentally altered the structure of the Circles of Evaluation._
