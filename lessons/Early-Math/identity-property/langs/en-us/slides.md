# The Identity Property

Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/discover-identity.adoc}. Look at the first problem (also below). Translate the verbal expressions into Circles of Evaluation. 

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

<!--
** _Possible responses: All three Circles include @math{12 + 4}. All three Circles evaluate to @math{16}._

# The Identity Property

Now, complete the workbook page by filling in the blanks for the remaining Circles. Avoid putting the same operator more than once.

What did you observe about the Identity Property for division? Subtraction?

<!--
Possible responses: I can multiply or divide by 1 	 and get an equivalent result. I can add or subtract 0
and get an equivalent result. I need to remember that Commutativity does not apply for division and subtraction!

# The Identity Property

Multiplying or dividing an expression by 1 does not change its value; similarly, adding or subtracting 0 results in the original value.

# The Identity Property

How does the Circle of Evaluation below illustrate the Identity Property?

{layout="Investigate"}
# The Identity Property

Now, consider this equation, which is really a pair of equivalent fractions: 

@math{\frac{3}{4} = \frac{15}{20}}

How is the Identity Property at play when we find an equivalent fraction?

<!--
When we find equivalent fractions, we _multiply by one_!In the example above, @math{\frac{3}{4}} was multiplied by @math{\frac{5}{5}} to get @math{\frac{15}{20}}.

{layout="Investigate"}
# The Identity Property

Complete @printable-exercise{pages/identity-prop-table.adoc}, filling in the blanks so that all of the Circles of Evaluation are equivalent. The first problem is below.

{layout="Investigate"}
# The Identity Property

Then, examine these Circles of Evaluation to decide @printable-exercise{pages/which-one-doesnt-belong.adoc}? Be sure to explain why each Circle of Evaluation you select does not belong with the others. The first problem is below.

@image{images/wodb.png,750}


<!--
As students explain why various Circles of Evaluation do not belong with the others, encourage them to practice using vocabulary that they have encountered already. For instance, @math{12} is _not_ equal to @math{0 - 12} because __the Commutative Property only holds for addition__. Although this example illustrates misuse of the Identity Propery (we can subtract zero from twelve, but not twelve from zero!), thinking about the Commutative Property can help students recognize what is going on.

# The Identity Property

- For which operations does the Identity Property hold?
- Did you encounter any instances where the Identity Property was used in combination with another property?

<!--
- For which operations does the Identity Property hold?
** _To apply the Identity Property, we add or subtract zero, or we multiply or divide by one._
- Did you encounter any instances where the Identity Property was used in combination with another property?
** _Yes! The Identity Property can be used in combination with the other properties we've discussed to create equivalent Circles._

# The Identity Property and Variables

We can represent the Identity Property with variables, in the same way that we could represent the Associative Property and the Commutative Property with variables. Here's an example:

@image{images/identityprop1.png}

{layout="Launch"}
# The Identity Property and Variables

Or like this:

@image{images/identityprop2.png}

---
{layout="Launch"}
# The Identity Property and Variables

The Identity Property will hold no matter what values we substitute in for @math{q} or for @math{t}. Although computation can help us test equivalence, thereâ€™s no way to test every possible value. 

The Identity Property lets us prove that these expressions are equivalent even with variables.

# The Identity Property and Variables

Complete @printable-exercise{pages/true-or-false-variables.adoc} using your knowledge of the Identity Property to determine if the equation represented by the Circles of Evaluation is true or false.

<!--
If students would like, they may choose values to represent the variables. Early finishers can substitute in numbers of their choosing to confirm that their analyses of the Circles of Evaluation are correct.

- Did you use computation to check your work? Or do you prefer thinking about properties and equivalence?
- There is a version of the Identity Property for each of the four operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is *not* the case for the Commutative Property or the Associative Property. Why is this so? How is the Identity Property different from these other properties?

** _Student responses will vary._

** _We do not actually change the structure of the original Circle of Evaluation when we apply the Identity Property - we simply nest it inside of another Circle, a Circle which represents adding/subtracting zero or multiplying/dividing by 1. When we applied the Commutative Property and Associative Property, we fundamentally altered the structure of the Circles of Evaluation._
