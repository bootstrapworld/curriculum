For each expression, draw _two_ unique Circles of Evaluation.

- In the column on the left, draw a Circle to illustrate evaluating from left to right.
- In the column on the right, draw a Circle to illustrate evaluating division first, followed by multiplication.
- Evaluate each Circle and make a note of whether or not they produce the same result.
We've done the first one for you.

@n Can you change the groupings or the order in which you evaluate an expression like this one: @math{100 \div 20 \div 5}? On the back of your paper, sketch out a few possible Circles. Which one is correct? Why do we need to use the left-to-right rule here? @fitb{}{}
