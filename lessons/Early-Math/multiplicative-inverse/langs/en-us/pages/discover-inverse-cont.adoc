@n What will the first Circle evaluate to? @fitb{5em}{80}  @hspace{5em} The second Circle? @fitb{5em}{80}

@n How is this pair of Circles similar to the first pair on this page? How is it different? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The same values are being used, but this time we are *dividing* by the fraction,}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{rather than dividing by the whole number. As a result, we get a larger outcome.}}

@center{**Did you know that dividing by @math{\frac{1}{4}} is the same as multiplying by @math{4}?**}

@n In the table below, draw another example like the one above to show how dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.
