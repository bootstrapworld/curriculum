| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Model an arithmetic expression using @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.
* Translate between expressions in words, Circles of Evaluation, and mathematical expressions.
* Recognize when expressions in words are ambiguous.


| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's use Circles of Evaluation to think about opposites and absolute value.

== Opposite @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview


=== Launch

Instruct students to draw a number line that spans from @math{-10} to @math{10}, or draw/project one at the front of the room.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Which number is the same distance away from zero as @math{8}?
** _@math{-8}_
- Which number is the same distance away from zero as @math{-3}?
** _@math{3}_
- The pairs of numbers we've just identified are called _opposites_ - two numbers that are the same distance from zero on the number line.
- What are some other pairs of opposites that you can identify?
** _Possible responses: @math{6.5} and @math{-6.5}; @math{4} and @math{-4}; @math{\frac {7}{3}} and @math{- \frac {7}{3}}._
- Do you think that zero has an opposite.
** _Zero is its own opposite._

=== Investigate

Explain to students that the function use to represent "find the opposite" is called `negate`. It can be used like any other operator that we put at the top of a Circle of Evaluation - with one important difference: when we use `negate`, we can include just one argument inside the Circle.

- Take a look at the Circle below. What does it evaluate to?
** _The Circle below evaluates to @math{-2}._

[.image]
@show{(coe '(negate 2))}
@clear

- What happens if we nest a negating Circle _inside of_ another negating Circle?
** _The opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself._

[.image]
@show{(coe '(negate (negate 2)))}
@clear

- Practice applying `negate` on Negate: True or False? The first few problems focus exclusively on `negate`, but later problems will assess if you remeber all of your different Circle Transformations.

=== Synthesize

- Two opposites are 8 units away from each other. What are the numbers?
** @math{4} and @math{-4}
- Cia says that opposites are always negative. Are they right? Why?
** _No, opposites are not always negative. When we negate a negative value, we get a positive value. Additionally, zero is its own opposite, and it is neither positive nor negative._
