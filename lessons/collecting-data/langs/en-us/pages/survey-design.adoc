= Design a Survey

@description{Students come up with a research question and design a survey to gather data to answer it. They exchange surveys and try to "hack" each other's study with garbage data to get some hands-on practice with clean and dirty data.}

== The Issue

There are a lot worries on students' minds these days: school work, world events, bigotry, poverty, lack of exercise, and social isolation are just a few examples. And the impact of various stressors will vary from student to student!

== Objectives

Upon completing this project - *in pairs or small groups* - your team will have learned how to use advanced survey tools to help gather "cleaner" data. You will also become familiar with many of the challenges faced by Data Scientists, and the potential problems lurking beneath the surface of headlines and opinions that are based on surveys.

== Phases of the Project

=== 1. Research Question

- Create an a new text document, adding your names, your teacher's name, and any other information to the cover page.
- On the second page, brainstorm a question you would like to ask of the students at your school. Write down why you chose this question, and why it's important to find the answer.
- Write down the kinds of data you will need to gather (e.g. - age, gender, impact of racism, stress about grades, etc.). Is this data quantitative or categorical? Will it be gathered as Numbers, Strings, or Booleans?
- Write up how you plan to analyze the data. Will you make pie charts? Scatter plots? Look for correlations?
- Write down any grouped samples that you'd want to explore separately (e.g. - just 8th graders just the males, etc).

=== 2. Design the Survey
Create a new Survey form, which must include the following:

- The title of the survey
- A desription of what the survey is for, and how responses will be used
- The questions for your survey
- Any and all data cleanliness mechanisms: which questions are required? Do they have good descriptions/instructions? Are you using response validation?

=== 3. Hack Each Other's Surveys!
Exchange surveys with another group, and try to enter as much "dirty" data as you can! For each dirty data example, write down what you submitted and what suggestion you would have to help the other group guard against it.
