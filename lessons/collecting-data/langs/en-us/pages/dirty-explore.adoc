A bunch of new animals are coming to the shelter, and that means more data! Open the @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wLPE6i4P7TMWxpcOnOHGMWBNYopwHf7GpdZMnbgosqA/edit?usp=sharing, New Animals Dataset} and take a _careful_ look.

There are many different ways that data can be dirty!

. *Missing Data* - A column containing some cells with data, but some cells left blank.

. *Inconsistent Types* - A column with inconsistent data types. For example, a `years` column where almost every cell is a Number, but one cell contains the string `"5 years old"`.

. *Inconsistent Units* - A column with consistent data types, but inconsistent units. For example, a `weight` column where some entries are in pounds but others are in kilograms.

. *Inconsistent Naming* - Inconsistent spelling and capitalization for entries lead to them being counted as different. For example, a `species` column where some entries are `"cat"` and others are `"Cat"` will not give us a full picture of the cats.

@n Sometimes data cleaning is straightforward. Sometimes the problem is evident but the solution is less certain. For which questions were you certain of your data cleaning suggestion? For which were you less certain? Why?
