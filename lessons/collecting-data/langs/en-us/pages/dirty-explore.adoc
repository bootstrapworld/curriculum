A bunch of new animals are coming to shelter, and that means more data! Open the @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wLPE6i4P7TMWxpcOnOHGMWBNYopwHf7GpdZMnbgosqA/edit?usp=sharing, New Animals Dataset} and look at the data _carefully_.

There are many different ways that data can be dirty!

. *Missing Data* - A column containing some cells with data, but some cells left blank.

. *Inconsistent Types* - A column with inconsistent data types. For example, a `years` column where almost every cell is a Number, but one cell contains the string `"5 years old"`.

. *Inconsistent Units* - A column with consistent data types, but inconsistent units. For example, a `weight` column where some entries are in pounds but others are in kilograms.
