== Creating a "Filter" Transformer

Open the Transformers plugin, and select `Filter`.

@n Enter a `filter-is-dog` as the name. What does this name tell you about the Transformer you are creating?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The Transformer will filter out only animals that are dogs.}}

@n Which dataset should we select, to apply this Transformer? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Animals Dataset}}

@n Examine the contract. Its input - or domain - is a Row. Explain why that makes sense.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{When we filter, we walk look at each row, one by one.}}


@n Now, take a look at the output - or range - of the contract. It is a Boolean. Why does that make snese?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are going to determine if the formula is true or false for each row.}}

@n A purpose statement explains the purpose of the expression. A good rule for purpose statements is to structure them like this: "The expression *_consumes_* one thing and *_produces_* another thing." Try writing a purpose statement for this expression.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The expression will consume an animal (Row) and produces true if that animal is a dog.}}

@n Enter `Species = "dog"` as the expression.

@n Select `Apply Transformer`. What happens?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A copy of the original dataset is created, with only dogs!}}

@n Try typing `species = "dog"` as the expression (instead of `Species = "dog"`). What happens?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_An error message appears that says, "Evaluating `species = "dog"` failed: 'species' is unrecognized."_}}

@n What happens when you enter `SPECIES = "dog"`? How about `Species = dog`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Error messages appear each._}}

== More Filtering

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-old` that creates a new dataset with animals older than 5 years. Note that `Age (years)` needs to be typed within backticks ` ` in order for CODAP to recognize it as an attribute. (The backtick key is in the upper left corner of the keyboard.) How many rows does the resulting table have?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_There are 9 rows._}}

@n Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-dog` that creates a new dataset with only dogs. How many dogs are there at the shelter?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_There are 15 dogs._}}
