== Sorting Tables, Part 1 @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students sort a column on a table by actually _changing_ the table.

=== Launch

Open the @link{https://codap.concord.org/app/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2FeZEwgF1qSm396MC6CNM9%2Ffile.json, Animals Dataset} in CODAP. How many animals' names start with the letter M? What would make it easier to figure out how many animals' names start with the letter M?


=== Investigate

Student work in groups or pairs. They will sort various columns on the table by clicking the attribute name, and selecting from the drop-down menu either `Sort Ascending` or `Sort Descending`.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Let's sort the animals alphabetically by name and see if we get the same answer as we did before!
- Sort the animals by age, from youngest to oldest.
- Sort the animals from heaviest to lightest.
- Sort the animals table by how long it took for each animal to be adopted, in ascending order.

=== Synthesize

. Can you think of a situation when it would be useful to sort animals from heaviest to lightest?

. Does sorting `animals-table` produce a _new_ table, or change the existing one? How do you know?

. Can you think of a situation where CODAP's default behavior - to alter the table each time we sort it - might inhibit more sophisticated data analysis?

== Sorting Tables, Part 2 @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Using the `Sort` Transformer, students sort rows of a table in ascending or descending order, according to one column. When they use transformers, students are building and modifying a _copy_ of the original table.

=== Launch
@span{.right}{@image{images/plugins-location.png,"", 300}

The Transformers plugin allows students to transform datasets to produce new, distinct datasets, rather than modifying the original input dataset itself.

First, show students how they can access the Transformers plugin (see screenshot on right), and invite them to explore the different Transformers available.

Explain to students that the `Sort` Transformer consumes: (1) a dataset; (2) a formula; (3) the _type_ that the formula evaluates to; and (4) a sort direction (ascending or descending). But what does it produce?

@span{.title}{What's a Contract?!}
Contracts help us keep track of the different Transformers we'll be using, and how they operate on each Row of a table. Every contract has three imporant parts:

- The Transformer’s _Name_
- The _Domain_ of the Transformer Expression - The type(s) of data we give it. For our purposes, this will always be a single `Row` of the table.
- The _Range_ of the Transformer Expression - The type of data the transformer produces from that Row

Check out the screenshot of the Transformers plugin below. What are the domain and range for `Filter`?

@centered-image{images/transformer-contract-example.png,"" ,300}

The Transformer `mean` doesn't display a contract. What type of data do you think `mean` must consume? Why?

|===

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
* Open the `Transformer` plugin, and choose the transformer `Sort`. Select `animals-dataset`. In the formula expression box, type `Name`. Select `ascending` as the direction and `Apply Tranformer`. What happens?
* Next, see what happens when you select `descending`.
* Sort the animals table from heaviest to lightest.
* Sort the animals table alphabetically by species.
* Sort the animals table by how long it took for each animal to be adopted, in ascending order.

=== Common Misconceptions
Students may be more familiar with filters that actually change the table. In CODAP, all transformers produce a _brand new table_. Filtered tables are automatically saved; CODAP titles each new table with a number in curly braces at the end (for example, `Filter(Animals-Dataset) {1}` ) to indicate how many times the transformer has been applied. When students apply a transformer, they have the option of selecting the original table from the dropdown menu, or a new table that they've generated. Students can also rename saved tables, if they’d like.

=== Synthesize
- Does the transformer `Sort` produce a _new_ table, or change the existing one?
- You've now learned two different strategies for sorting a column of a table. What do the two strategies have in common? How are they different?

== Filtering Tables @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _filter_ tables by removing Rows.

=== Launch
Explain to students that you have "Function Cards", which describe the purpose statement of a function that consumes a Row from a table of students, and produces a Boolean (e.g. - "this student is wearing glasses"). Select a volunteer to be the "Filter Transformer", and have them _randomly choose_ a function card from from the @opt-printable-exercise{pages/function-cards.adoc, Function Cards} set, and make sure they read it without showing it to anyone else.

Have 6-8 students line up in front of the classroom, and have the filter transformer go to each student and say "stay" or "sit" depending on whether their function would return true or false for that student. If they say "sit", the student sits down. If they say "stay", the student stays standing.

Ask the class: based on who sat and who stayed, _what function was on the card?_

[.lesson-point]
The `Filter` Transformer takes a dataset and produces a copy of it that contains only the cases for which the given formula evaluates to true.

Suppose we want to get a table of only animals that have been fixed? The `Filter` transformer consumes a dataset to filter and a formula expression that evaluates to either true or false.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
* Open the `Transformer` plugin, and choose the transformer `Filter`. Select `animals-dataset`. In the formula expression box, type `Fixed = “TRUE”`. Apply the transformer. What happens?
* Does CODAP mind if you forget to capitalize? What about if you leave out quotation marks?  Examine the error messages that appear if you are just a little careless as you enter text into the formula expression box.
* This time, in the formula expression box, type `Age > 5`. What did you get?
* Now try `Species = “dog”`

The `Filter` Transformer walks through the table, applying whatever formula it was given to each row, and produces a new table containing all the rows for which the formula returned `true`. Notice that `Filter` takes a dataset and produces a copy of it that contains only the cases for which the given formula evaluates to true. If it consumes anything besides a single `Row`, or if it produces anything else besides a `Boolean`, we'll get an error.

=== Synthesize
Debrief with students. Some guiding questions on filtering:

- Suppose we wanted to determine whether cats or dogs get adopted faster. How might using the `Filter` transformer help?
- If the shelter is purchasing food for older cats, what filter would we write to determine how many cats to buy for?
- Can you think of a situation where filtering fixed animals would be helpful?

== Building Columns @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _build columns_, using the `Build Attribute` transformer.

=== Launch
Suppose we want to _transform_ our table, converting `pounds` to `kilograms` or `weeks` to `days`. The `Build Attribute` transformer makes a new copy of a dataset, and adds a new attribute. We must provide a dataset, a name for the new attribute, an existing collection to add the attribute to, a formula for the attribute’s values, and an indication of the type of value the formula will evaluate to.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
* Open the `Transformer` plugin, and choose the transformer `Build Attribute.` Select `animals-dataset`.
* Enter `Young` as the `Name of New Attribute`. Select `cases` as the `Collection to Add To`. In the formula expression box, type `Age < 5`.  Apply the transformer. What happens?
* Now, enter `is-cat` as the `Name of New Attribute` and try typing `Species = “cat”` in the formula expression box. What do you get? What do you think is going on?

The `Build Attribute` Transformer walks through the table, applying whatever formula expression it was given to each row. Whatever the formula expression produces for that row becomes the value of our new column, which is named based on the string it was given. In the first example, we gave it `Age < 5`, so the new table had an extra Boolean column for every animal, indicating whether or not it was young.

=== Synthesize
Debrief with students. Ask them if they can think of a situation where they would want to use this. Some ideas:

- A dataset from Europe might list everything in metric (centimeters, kilograms, etc), so we could build a column to convert that to imperial units (inches, pounds, etc).
- A dataset about schools might include columns for how many students are in the school and how many of those students identify as multi-racial. But when comparing schools of different sizes, what we really want is a column showing what _percentage_ of students identify as multi-racial. We could use  to compute that for every row in the table.

Being able to define  is a _huge_ upgrade in our ability to analyze data! But as a wise person once said, "with great power comes great responsibility"! Dropping all the dogs from our dataset might be a cute exercise in this class, but suppose we want to drop certain populations from a national census? Even a small programming error could erase millions of people, impact funding for things like roads and schools, etc.
