Make sure you've opened the @starter-file{table-methods} on your computer, defined `dog-row`, `old-row` and `unfixed-row`, and clicked "Run".

== Ordering Rows
@n What does `animals-table.order-by("name", true)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Rows of the table, sorted alphabetically by name from A-Z_}}

@n What does `animals-table.order-by("age", false)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Rows of the table, sorted alphabetically by name from Z-A_}}

@n Sort the animals table from heaviest to lightest.

@n Sort the animals table alphabetically by _species_.

@n Sort the animals table by how long it took for each animal to be adopted, from longest to shortest adoption time.

@n What do `.order-by` and `.row-n` have in common? How are they different?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Both are methods that work on tables. `.order-by` takes a column name and a Boolean, and `.row-n` takes a Number_}}

@fitb{}{}

== Filtering Rows
@n What does `animals-table.filter(lookup-fixed)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_A table with only the fixed animals_}}

@n What does `animals-table.filter(is-dog)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_A table with only the dogs_}}

@n Write the code to generate a table showing only the old animals. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`animals-table.filter(is-old)`}}

@n What do the contracts for `lookup-fixed`, `is-dog`, and `is-old` have in common?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_They all produce Booleans_}}

@n What happens if you evaluate `animals-table.filter(lookup-name)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Error_}}

@n Find the Contract for `.filter`. What is its Domain? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A function}}

@n Where else have we seen functions that consume functions? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_image-scatter-plot_}}

== Building Columns
@n What does `animals-table.build-column("old", is-old)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_A table with a new column called "old", filled with values from `is-old`_}}

@n What does `animals-table.build-column("sticker", label)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_A table with a new column called "sticker", filled with values from `label`_}}

@n In your own words, how does the `.build-column` method work?
