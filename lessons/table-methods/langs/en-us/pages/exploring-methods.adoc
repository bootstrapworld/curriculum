= Exploring Methods

Make sure you've opened the @starter-file{table-methods} on your computer, and clicked "Run".

== Ordering Rows
@n What does `animals-table.order-by("name", true)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Rows of the table, sorted alphabetically by name from A-Z}}

@n What does `animals-table.order-by("age", false)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Rows of the table, sorted alphabetically by name from Z-A}}

@n Sort the animals table from heaviest to lightest.

@n Sort the animals table alphabetically by _species_.

@n Sort the animals table by how long it took for each animal to be adopted, from longest to shortest adoption time.

@n What do `.order-by` and `.row-n` have in common? How are they different?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Both are methods that work on tables. `.order-by` takes a column name and a Boolean, and `.row-n` takes a Number}}

@fitb{}{}

== Filtering Rows
@n What does `animals-table.filter(lookup-fixed)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table with only the fixed animals}}

@n What does `animals-table.filter(is-dog)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table with only the dogs}}

@n Write the code to generate a table showing only the old animals. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`animals-table.filter(is-old)`}}

@n What do the contracts for `lookup-fixed`, `is-dog`, and `is-old` have in common?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{They all produce Booleans}}

@n What happens if you evaluate `animals-table.filter(lookup-name)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Error}}

@n Find the Contract for `.filter`. What is its Domain? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A function}}

@n Where else have we seen functions that consume functions? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{image-scatter-plot}}

== Building Columns
@n What does `animals-table.build-column("old", is-old)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table with a new column called "old", filled with values from `is-old`}}

@n What does `animals-table.build-column("sticker", label)` evaluate to?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table with a new column called "sticker", filled with values from `label`}}

@n In your own words, how does the `.build-column` method work?
