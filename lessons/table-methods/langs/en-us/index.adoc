== Functions that Work on Rows @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students review row definitions, and get more practice reading the definitions of functions that work on rows.

=== Launch
Load the @starter-file{table-methods}, go to the File menu, and click "Save a Copy".

This activity is about reading carefully, getting more comfortable with functions that work on rows.

=== Investigate

Student work in groups or pairs.

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{pages/row-and-function-definitions.adoc}.

Take a look at the three examples for `is-dog`. Each one shows us a different way of thinking about examples, in this case using a row that should return `false`:

```
examples:
  is-dog(cat-row) is false
  is-dog(cat-row) is "cat" == "dog"
  is-dog(cat-row) is cat-row["species"] == "dog"
end
```

. The first example just tells us the answer we think we'll get back. `cat-row` is NOT a dog, so we expect `false`!
. The second example shows us some of the work involved: we know the species of the row is `"cat"`, and comparing that to the String `"dog"` will return `false`.
. The third example shows __all the work__: given the `cat-row`, we lookup the value in the `"species"` column and compare it to the String `"dog"`.

[.lesson-instruction]
Add three _true_ examples for `is-dog`, this time using the `dog-row` you defined above.

=== Synthesize
* Who can explain what `is-old` does?
* Who can explain what `lookup-name` does?
* Who can explain what `lookup-fixed` does?
* Who can explain what `label` does?
* Who can explain what `kilos` does?

Challenge them to use terminology like "looks up the value in the X column" when describing a lookup.


== Ordering, Filtering, and Building @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn to sort rows of a table in ascending or descending order, filter the rows using a Boolean-producing function, and build a new column.

=== Launch
Select 6-8 students, each of whom will represent a unique Row of a dataset called “Students.”  Arrange them in a line at the front of the room. Tell the class that you are going to select a volunteer who will play the role of… *Order*!

[.lesson-point]
* Each of you represents a Row in a table of students
* Standing together, you represent a _sample_ of the class, stored in a table.
* Like you, each student has columns like "First Name", "Last Name", "Birthday", "Favorite Food", etc.

A Table is a collection of Rows. And we can _do things_ to collections!

One thing we can do is *order the rows by some criteria*. What are some ways to sort this table?

Announce to your volunteer "Sort the Rows by height, from smallest to largest!", and have them do it. Then announce to your volunteer "Sort the Rows by height, from largest to smallest!", and have them do it.

Solicit other ideas, like sorting by birthday. Try sorting in ascending **and** descending order!

Give the volunteer a round of applause, and then tell the class that you are going to select another volunteer who will play the role of… *Filter*!

Hand the volunteer a Function card from the @opt-printable-exercise{pages/function-cards.adoc, Function Cards} set. Instruct them to read the card carefully, making sure they understand what it will do for each "Row" (student!) in the "Table" (line of students), but to keep that information a secret from the other students.

Explain to the class that the volunteer playing Filter will walk from one student to the next, referring to the function (on the card) in order to determine if each student should stand or sit.

Here’s how that might look if Filter chose an expression called `likes-pizza`.

* *Filter to Student 1:* Do you like pizza?
* *Student 1:* Yes
* *Filter:* Remain standing. (Student 1 remains standing.)
* *Filter to Student 2:* Do you like pizza?
* *Student 2:* No.
* *Filter:* Sit down. (Student 2 sits.)

Have your Filter volunteer go through all their peers, applying their card to each one.

[.lesson-instruction]
Based on who sat and who stayed, what was on the card?

=== Investigate
Pyret Tables have their own methods for sorting, filtering, and more.

Complete questions 1-6 on @printable-exercise{exploring-methods.adoc}

* How does the `.order-by` method work?
** `.order-by` consumes a String (the name of the column by which to sort) and a @vocab{Boolean} (`true` for ascending, `false` for descending), and sorts the rows according to that column.
* Does sorting the `animals-table` produce a _new_ table, or change the existing one?
** It creates a new one
* How could we test this?
** Sort the table, then evaluate `animals-table` and see if it stayed sorted

- Find the contract for `.filter` in your Contracts page.

* What is its Domain?
** `.filter` takes a _Boolean-producing function_
* How does the `.filter` method work?
** It produces a new table containing only rows for which the function returns `true`.
* Does sorting the `animals-table` produce a _new_ table, or change the existing one?
** It creates a new one

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete questions 14-16 on @printable-exercise{exploring-methods.adoc}

* What is its Domain?
** `.build-column` takes in a String and a _function_
* How the `.build-column` method work?
** It produces a new table with an extra column, using the String for the column title, and fills in the values by applying the function to every Row.
* Does sorting the `animals-table` produce a _new_ table, or change the existing one?
** It creates a new one

=== Common Misconceptions
*Students often think that these methods _change_ the table!* In Pyret, all table methods produce a _brand new table_. If we want to save that table, we need to define it. For example: `cats = animals-table.filter(is-cat)`.

=== Synthesize
Being able to define functions and use them with Table Methods is a _huge_ upgrade in our ability to analyze data!

- Suppose we wanted to determine whether cats or dogs get adopted faster. How might using the `.filter` method help?
- If the shelter is purchasing food for older cats, what filter would we write to determine how many cats to buy for?
- A dataset from Europe might list everything in metric (centimeters, kilograms, etc), so we could build a column to convert that to imperial units (inches, pounds, etc).
- A dataset about schools might include columns for how many students are in the school and how many of those students identify as multi-racial. But when comparing schools of different sizes, what we really want is a column showing what @vocab{percentage} of students identify as multi-racial. We could use `.build-column` to compute that for every row in the table.

- **What are some columns you might want to build for _your_ dataset?**
