_In 1676, during King Phillips War, Lancaster, MA came under attack by the Narragansett, Wampanoag, and Nashaway/Nipmuc. Mary Rowlandson was captured for ransom during the raid and lived with her captors for 3 months before funds were raised to return her to her home. Her journals were later published._

They eat also nuts and acorns, harty-choaks (artichokes), lilly roots, ground-beans, and several other weeds and roots, that I know not. They would pick up old bones, and cut them to pieces at the joints, and if they were full of worms and magots, they would scald them over the fire to make the vermin come out, and then boil them, and drink up the liquor, and then beat the great ends of them in a mortar, and so eat them. They would eat horses guts, and ears, and all sorts of wild birds which they could catch: also bear, venison (deer), beaver, tortoise (turtle), frogs, squirrels, dogs, skunks, rattle-snakes; yea, the very bark of treesâ€¦
