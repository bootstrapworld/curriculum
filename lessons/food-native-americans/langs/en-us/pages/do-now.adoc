*Introducing our New Unit*

Food is an important part of culture. Different cultures eat different foods. Cultures can grow or get food in different ways. What people eat also changes over time. Studying food can tell us about history. It can also help us understand how Americans developed the current food habits of today.

For the next two weeks, you will be working to figure out why it’s so hard for Americans to eat the right foods to stay healthy. Has this always been a problem in our country? We will study various locations and look at historical evidence and data. This will help you report if what we eat and how we get our food has changed over time.

We’ll start with the Native Americans and early settlers to learn more about what they ate and how they got food. Then, we will explore data about jobs and where people lived. These will give us a clue about how food habits changed over time. We’ll also discuss inventions that changed how people get food from farms. At the end of this unit, you will write your answer to the following big questions:

- How has the way Americans get food changed from the time of early Native Americans up until now?
- Does the way we eat now seem better or worse than before?

@n In your own words, what will you be researching in this unit?
