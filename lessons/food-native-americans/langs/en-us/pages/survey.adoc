= Homework (Survey)

Answer the questions to the survey under R1 (respondent 1) in class. For homework, before the next social studies class, survey 5 people who are older than you (parents, older siblings, other relatives, neighbors). Ask them each question to see what they know or think about Native Americans and modern Americans. Circle each Respondent’s answer. (The 2nd Respondent’s answers all get circled below R2, and so on; the 6th Respondent’s answers all get circled below R6.) Give the completed survey sheet to your teacher next class.
