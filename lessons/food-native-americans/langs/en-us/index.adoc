= Native Americans’ Food from the Land

@description{Early Native Americans, who lived in small villages, obtained their food directly from the land. They viewed the land as a source of food and other supports for living, rather than as property to be owned. Native Americans lived off the land nearby through hunting, gathering, and planting. Students explore aspects of how Native Americans interacted with the land: what they ate, where their food came from, and how they named places on the land. Today’s work begins to set the stage for food production, in preparation for studying changes in these ways as settlers arrived from Europe.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...
* analyze primary sources and interpret data to determine the similarities and differences between food habits (what we eat and how we get our food) of Native Americans before European settlement and modern-day Americans.
* express proportion as count divided by total
* match fractional proportions to pie chart slices by area
* administer a survey


| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|
* Let's look at some primary sources and data to learn how what we eat and how we get our food today is similar to and different from Native American food habits before the arrival of European settlers in North America.

=== Overview

=== Launch

Have students complete the @printable-exercise{do-now.adoc}
Prompt students to complete a turn and talk to share answers with their neighbor: “Before we begin, please share your answers with your neighbor.”

How do we learn about what people ate hundreds of years ago?

We know that archaeologists can dig up people’s bones, but to study food habits of early Americans, historians can also start with stories or letters that talk about what people ate.

Today we will be reading some primary written accounts from the National Archives in New York City to read some of what others wrote about Native American diets hundreds of years ago!

[.lesson-instruction]
But first, what is a @vocab{primary source}?

_A primary source is any piece of information that was created by someone who witnessed first hand or was part of the historical events that are being described. The most common primary sources are journals or letters._

The first writing we will investigate is from a book written in 1682 by Mary Rowlandson. She was captured by Native Americans *WHERE* and lived with them for three months.

Turn to @printable-exercise{mary-rowlandson.adoc} and follow along as I read her account aloud. Circle or underline any clues you see about what Native Americans ate!

If there are questions about the strange spelling, see @link{https://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/25489}

After reading, have students record answers on their sheet and then share out.

The second reading is from a book by Roger Williams. He was a minister who founded the state of Rhode Island in the 1600s. He was also the first person to try to end slavery in America. Roger Williams was a friend to Native Americans and wrote about how much corn their families grew to feed themselves each year.

Turn to @printable-exercise{roger-williams.adoc}. Read it with your partner and complete the questions.

=== Synthesize

- According to Mary Rowlandson and Roger Williams, how did Native Americans get their food?
- We have read two paragraphs written by English settlers, but nothing written by Native Americans themselves. Why might that be?

== Foods by Food Group

=== Overview

=== Launch

We want to use this evidence from Mary Rowlandson and Roger Williams to learn more about what Native Americans were eating and how they were getting their food. Data scientists sometimes organize the same data in different ways to answer different questions.

=== Investigate

[lesson-instruction]
--

Turn to @opt-printable-exercise{food-evidence.adoc}, which includes all of the Native American foods that were mentioned in the paragraphs.

I want you to categorize the foods mentioned by Food Group: What kinds of foods (grain, protein, fruits and vegetables) are most and least common in our list of 20 items?

The backside of each card is labeled with the kind of food that it is: “grain”, “protein”, “fruits/vegetables”, or “other.” Sort the cards into piles based on the kind of food, and then complete the first half of @printable-exercise{food-categories.adoc}.

=== Synthesize

Confirm that all students have the correct answers recorded.


== Foods by Source

=== Overview

=== Launch

Now that we know what sorts of foods Native Americans were eating, let’s see if we can figure out where they were getting their food.

Native Americans got the foods that were mentioned in these two paragraphs in various ways. Some were hunted. Some were lying around and gathered. Some were planted on purpose. What proportion of those Native American food items were (a) planted (b) hunted and (c) gathered?

=== Investigate

With a partner, sort the cards into four piles based on how Native Americans got each food: “Hunted”, “Gathered”, “Planted”, and “Unknown.” Fill your proportions into the following blanks and answer the questions!

=== Synthesize
Confirm that all students have the correct answers recorded.

== Place Names

=== Overview

=== Launch

It’s now time for your final investigation of the day! We are going to look into how Native Americans and settlers named their land to see if that can tell us anything about their culture or how they got food! Let’s read together to learn a bit about how they used place names.

- Read @printable-exercise{land-names.adoc} together with students.
- How is the way Native Americans named land different from how the settlers did?

=== Investigate
Give students directions and allow them to work. After a few minutes, have a few students share with partners and then out to the class.

=== Synthesize
40-44 minutes—Evidence Journal:
It’s time to summarize your findings for today! We will end class this way every day and your answers will be used to give you a grade on how hard you worked as a reporter today. Make sure to restate the question, answer in complete sentences, and show what you know!

Turn to your evidence journal and begin—Based on your experience in modern America, list three things you noticed that are different between our habits and Native Americans’, for type of food eaten and where it came from.

== Homework

Tonight you are going to conduct a @handout{survey.adoc} to help us see what people know and don’t know about the topic we are researching in this unit!

You will fill out column R1 of the survey and then interview 5 other people about what they think they know, to fill in R2 to R6.

*Note:* Solutions not to be divulged until Day 6!
1(a) 2(any of these: researchers haven’t figured it out yet!) 3(any of these) 4 (d) 5(a)
