Make sure you've opened the @starter-file{table-functions} on your computer, saved a copy, and clicked "Run".


@n What name is being defined on line 8?  @fitb{}{@ifsoln{animals-table}}

@n How many columns are listed?           @fitb{}{@ifsoln{8}}

@n What name is being defined on line 15? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{cat-row}}

@n Is `cat-row` a Number, String, Image or Row?   @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Row}}

@n Type `cat-row` into the Interactions Area. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the row for "Sasha"}}

@n On line 26, add the definition for a new Row of your choosing.

@n A Contract for a function is written on line 32. What is its name? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{is-dog}}

@n What is its Domain?  @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Row}}

@n What is its Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}

@n What other functions are defined here? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_`is-old`, `lookup-name`, `lookup-fixed`, etc_}}

@n Use the function `is-dog`, passing in a Row. For example, type `is-dog(dog-row)`. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`true`}}

@n Evaluate `is-dog(cat-row)`. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`false`}}

**For the remaining functions, read the code and try to guess what it does _before_ testing it out by passing in a Row.

@n What does `is-old` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Looks up the age of the row, and asks if it is greater than 10}}

@n What does `lookup-name` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{looks up the value in the `name` column}}

@n What does `lookup-fixed` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{looks up the value in the `fixed` column}}

@n What does `label` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{prints the animal's name in red}}

@n What does `kilos` do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{divides the pounds by 2.2}}
