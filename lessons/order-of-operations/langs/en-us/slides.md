# Order of Operations

If you were to write instructions for getting ready for school, it would matter very much which instruction came first: putting on your socks, putting on your shoes, etc. 

Sometimes we need multiple expressions in mathematics, and the order matters there, too!

# Order of Operations

Mathematicians didnâ€™t always agree on the order of operations, but at some point it became important to develop rules to help them work together.

# Order of Operations

__@math{6 \div 2(1 + 2)}__{style="font-size:46pt"}

Instead of using a rule for computing answers, let's start by diagramming the math itself!

{layout="LaunchR"}
# Order of Operations

*Circles of Evaluation* allow us to draw the structure of mathematics. The rules are simple:{style="font-size:15pt"}

__Rule #1:__ Every Circle must have one - and only one! - function written at the top.

__Rule #2:__ The inputs to the function are written left-to-right, in the middle of the Circle.

__Rule #3:__ Circles can contain other circles.

<!--
In this example, the function is division and the inputs are 6 and 3 (in that order!.
Math teachers: you may be used to calling division an *operator*, but operators are
all just functions that we write a little differently!

What if we want to use multiple functions?  

What is the Circle of Evaluation for @smath{(/ 6 (+ 1 2))}?

# Order of Operations

Circles can contain other Circles. We basically replace the `3` from our earlier Circle of Evaluation with _another_ Circle, which adds 1 and 2!{style="font-size:15pt"}

# From Circles of Evaluation to Code

When converting a Circle of Evaluation to code, it's useful to imagine a spider crawling through the circle from the left and exiting on the right. 

The first thing the spider does is cross over a curved line - an open parenthesis - then visit the function @ifproglang{pyret}{ or operation} at the top. 

After that, she crawls from left to right, visiting each of the inputs. Finally, she has to leave the circle by crossing another curved line (a close parenthesis).

# From Circles of Evaluation to Code

Arithmetic expressions involving more than one operation will end up with more than one circle,  @ifproglang{wescheme}{and more than one pair of parentheses.}@ifproglang{pyret}{and the code requires parentheses to clarify the order in which the operations should be completed - whether or not there are parentheses in the original expression.}

# From Circles of Evaluation to Code

What did you learn from Circles of Evaluation?

@ifproglang{pyret}{
As in math, in Pyret there are some cases where the outermost parentheses can be removed:

- @math{(1 + 2)} can be safely written as @math{1 + 2}, and the same goes for the Pyret code
- @math{(1 * 2) * 3)} can be safely written as @math{1 * 2 * 3}, and the same goes for the Pyret code

It is always better to at least start with the parentheses before taking them out. **It is never wrong to include them!**

# Testing out your Code

- Open @starter-file{editor} and click run.
- For now, we'll work in the Interactions Area on the right.
- Type @show{(code '(+ (* 8 2) (/ 6 3)))} 
- Notice how the editor __highlights pairs of parentheses__!
- Hit Enter (or Return) to evaluate this expression. What happens?
- Test each line of code you wrote by typing them into the Interactions Area. Use the error messages to edit your code to get it working.

- Can you figure out the Name for the function in the second Circle?{style="font-size:15pt"}

Possible responses: 
- _We've never seen the function `text` before_
- _We've never seen words used in a Circle of Evaluation before_
- _We've never seen a function take in three inputs_
- _We've never seen a function take in a mix of Numbers and words_

There's more than just operators like addition and subtraction! Math also has _functions_, and so does Pyret! In math, the name of the function comes first, and Pyret is no differeny.

When converting a Circle of Evaluation that has a function, the spider starts at the **top** and visits the function, then visits the inputs from left-to-right.

The `text` Circle would be translated as @show{(coe  '(text "Good work!" 50 "red"))}
