# Order of Operations

If you were to write instructions for getting ready for school, it would matter very much which instruction came first: putting on your socks, putting on your shoes, etc. 

Sometimes we need multiple expressions in mathematics, and the order matters there, too!

# Order of Operations

Mathematicians didn’t always agree on the order of operations, but at some point it became important to develop rules to help them work together.

# Order of Operations

__@math{6 \div 2(1 + 2)}__{style="font-size:46pt"}

Instead of using a rule for computing answers, let's start by diagramming the math itself!

{layout="LaunchR"}
# Order of Operations

*Circles of Evaluation* allow us to draw the structure of mathematics. The rules are simple:{style="font-size:15pt"}

__Rule #1:__ Every Circle must have one - and only one! - operator written at the top.

__Rule #2:__ The inputs to the function are written left-to-right, in the middle of the Circle.

__Rule #3:__ Circles can contain other circles.

What if we want to use multiple functions?  

What is the Circle of Evaluation for @smath{(/ 6 (+ 1 2))}?

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Order of Operations

Circles can contain other Circles. We basically replace the `3` from our earlier Circle of Evaluation with _another_ Circle, which adds 1 and 2!{style="font-size:15pt"}

Turn to  @printable-exercise{pages/translate-arithmetic-to-coe-and-code-1-intro-w-parenth.adoc} and draw Circles of Evaluation for each of the expressions. 

Ignore the code column for now! We will come back to it later.

# From Circles of Evaluation to Code

As in math, in Pyret there are some cases where the outermost parentheses can be removed:

- @math{(1 + 2)} can be safely written as @math{1 + 2}, and the same goes for the Pyret code
- @math{(1 * 2) * 3)} can be safely written as @math{1 * 2 * 3}, and the same goes for the Pyret code

It is always better to at least start with the parentheses before taking them out. **It is never wrong to include them!**

# Testing out your Code

- Open @ifproglang{wescheme}{@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme}}@ifproglang{pyret}{@link{https://code.pyret.org, pyret} } and click run.
- For now, we'll work in the interactions area on the right.
- Type @show{(code '(+ (* 8 2) (/ 6 3)))} 
- Notice how the editor highlights pairs of parentheses.
- Hit Enter (or Return) to evaluate this expression. What happens?
- Test each line of code you wrote by typing them into the Interactions Area. Use the error messages to edit your code to get it working.

	Possible responses: We’ve never seen the function text before. We’ve never seen words used in a Circle of Evaluation before. We’ve never seen a function take in three inputs. We’ve never seen a function take in a mix of Numbers and words.
