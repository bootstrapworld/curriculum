If you were to write instructions for getting ready for school, it would matter very much which instruction came first: putting on your socks, putting on your shoes, etc.

Sometimes we need multiple expressions in mathematics, and the order matters there, too! Mathematicians didnâ€™t always agree on the *Order of Operations*, but at some point it became important to develop rules to help them work together.

To help us organize our math into something we can trust, we can _diagram_ a math expression using the *Circles of Evaluation*. For example, the expression @smath{(/ (- 1 4) (* 10 7))} can be diagrammed as shown below.

@show{(coe `(/ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)))}

*Order of Operations* is important when programming, too!

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
To convert a *Circle of Evaluation* into Code, we walk through the circle from outside-in, moving left-to-right. We type an open parenthesis when we _start_ a circle, and a close parenthesis when we _end_ one. Once we're in a circle, we first write the *function* at the top, then write the inputs from left to right. The circle above, for example, would be programmed as @show{(code '(/ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)))}.

To convert a *Circle of Evaluation* into code, we walk through the circle from outside-in, moving left-to-right. We type an open parenthesis when we _start_ a circle, and a close parenthesis when we _end_ one. Once we're in a circle, we write whatever is on the left of the circle, then the *operation* at the top, and then whatever is on the right. The circle above, for example, would be programmed as @show{(code '(/ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)) #:parens true)}.
