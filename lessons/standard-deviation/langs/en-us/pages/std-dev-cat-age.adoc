= Computing Standard Deviation

The histogram below shows the ages of ten cats at the shelter:

@image{images/stdev-cat-age.png, "A histogram showing the distribution of ages for 10 cats, between the ages of 1 and 8, with 1-year intervals", 100%}

@n Describe the shape of this histogram. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_slight right skew_}}

@n How many cats are 1 year old? 2 years old? Fill in the table below by reading the histogram. The first column has been done for you.

@n What is the mean age of the cats in this histogram? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{3}}

@n In the histogram above, *draw a star on the x-axis to locate the mean*.

@n For each cat in the histogram above, *draw a horizontal arrow* under the axis from your star to the cat's interval, and *label the arrow with its distance from the mean*. (For example, if the mean is 2 and a cat is in the 5yr interval, your arrow would stretch from 2 to 5, and be labeled with the distance "3")

@n We've listed the four 1-year-old cats for you, each of which is 2 years away from the mean. Using your table above, finish the list of all the distances from your histogram.

@fitb{}{2, 2, 2, 2, @ifsoln{1, 1, 0, 2, 4, 4}}

@vspace{1ex}

**To compute the standard deviation, we square each of the distances, add them, average them, then take the square root of the result.
**

@n List all the *squared* distances: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 16, 16}}

@n Add all the squared distances. What is their sum? @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{54}} What is the average squared distance? @fib{}{@ifsoln{5.4}}

@n Take the square root to find the *standard deviation*! @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.3}}
