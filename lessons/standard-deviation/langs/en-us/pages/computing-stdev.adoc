= Computing Standard Deviation

The histogram below shows the ages of ten cats at the shelter:

@image{images/stdev-cat-age.png, "A histogram showing the distribution of ages for 10 cats, between the ages of 1 and 8, with 1-year intervals", 100%}

@n Describe the shape of this histogram. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{slight right skew}}

@n How many cats are 1 year old? 2 years old? Fill in the table below by reading the histogram. The first column has been done for you.

@n What is the mean age of the cats in this histogram? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{3}}

@n *Draw a star to locate the mean on the x-axis of the histogram above*.

@n For each cat in the histogram above, *draw a horizontal arrow* under the axis from your star to the cat's interval, and *label the arrow with its distance from the mean*. (For example, if the mean is 3 and a cat is in the 1yr interval, your arrow would stretch from 1 to 3, and be labeled with the distance "2")

@n We want to summarize all 10 distances from the mean into a single number.

Which one of these seems closest: 1, 2, 4, or 5? @fitb{}{}

[.lesson-point]
To compute the standard deviation we square each distance and take the average, then take the square root of the average.


@n We've recorded the 10 ages shown in the histogram above in the table below and listed the distance-from-mean for the four 1-year-old cats for you. As you can see, 1 year-olds are 2 years away from the mean, so their squared distance is 4. Complete the table.

@n Add all the squared distances. What is their sum? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{54}}

@n What is the average squared distance? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{5.4}}

@n Take the square root to find the *standard deviation*! @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.3}}
