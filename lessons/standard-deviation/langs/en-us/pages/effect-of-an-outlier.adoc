= The Effect of an Outlier

The histogram below shows the ages of eleven cats at the shelter:

@image{../images/histogram-with-outlier.png, "A histogram showing the distribution of ages for 10 cats, between the ages of 1 and 8. An 11th cat has been added at 16 years.", 100%}

@n Describe the shape of this histogram. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_slight right skew_}}

@n How many cats are 1 year old? 2 years old? Fill in the table below by reading the histogram. The first column has been done for you.

@n What is the mean age of the cats in this histogram? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_~4.2_}}

@n *Draw a star to identify the mean on the histogram above*.

@n For each cat in the histogram above, *draw a horizontal arrow* from the mean to the cat's interval, and *label the arrow with its distance from the mean*. (For example, if the mean is 2 and a cat is 5 years old, your arrow would stretch from 2 to 5, and be labeled with the distance "3")

[.lesson-point]
To compute the standard deviation we square each distance and take the average, then take the square root of the average.

@n Recorded the 11 ages shown in the histogram in the first row of the table below. For each age, compute the distance from the mean and the squared distance.
