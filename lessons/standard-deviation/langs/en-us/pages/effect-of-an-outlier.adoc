= The Effect of an Outlier

The histogram below shows the ages of eleven cats at the shelter:

@image{../images/histogram-with-outlier.png, "A histogram showing the distribution of ages for 10 cats, between the ages of 1 and 8. An 11th cat has been added at 16 years.", 100%}

@n Describe the shape of this histogram. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_slight right skew_}}

@n How many cats are 1 year old? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{_4_}} @hspace{1em} 2 years old? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{_2_}} @hspace{1em} 3 years old? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{_1_}} @hspace{1em}  4 years old? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{_0_}}

@n How many cats are 5 years old? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{_1_}} @hspace{1em} 7 years old? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{_2_}} @hspace{1em} 16 years old? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{_0_}}

@n What is the mean age of the cats in this histogram? @fitb{}{}

@n In the histogram above, *draw a vertical arrow that identifies the mean*.

@n For each cat in the histogram above, *draw a horizontal arrow* from the mean to the cat's interval, and *label the arrow with its distance from the mean*. (For example, if the mean is 2 and a cat is 5 years old, your arrow would stretch from 2 to 5, and be labeled with the distance "3")

@n List all the labels/distances from your histogram: @fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

**To compute the standard deviation, we square all of the distances and add them, then take the square root of the result.
**

@n List all the *squared* distances: @fitb{}{}

@n Add all the squared distances. What is the sum of all the squares? @fitb{}{}

@n Take the square root to find the *standard deviation*! @fitb{}{}
