= Computing Standard Deviation (2)

Shown below are ten different family incomes:

$43k, $62k, $39k, $141k, $58k, $82k, $41k, $73k, $68, $73k

@n Draw a **number line** representing the distribution of this data.

@center{@image{../images/numline.svg}}

@n What is the mean income of the families in this dataset? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{$68k}}

@n *Draw a star to locate the mean on the x-axis of the histogram above*.

@n For each family on the number line you drew, *draw a horizontal arrow* under the axis from your star to that family's interval, and *label the arrow with its distance from the mean*. (For example, if the mean is 50 and a family's income is $82k, your arrow would stretch from 50 to 82, and be labeled with the distance "32")

[.lesson-point]
To compute the standard deviation we square each distance and take the average, then take the square root of the average.


@n For each of the 10 incomes in the table below, list the distance-from-mean for each income, using the mean you computed above. Then fill in the squared distance in the next row.

@n Add all the squared distances. What is their sum? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{7,815}}

@n There are N=10 distances. What is N-1? @fitb{4rem}{@ifsoln{9}} @hspace{2rem} Divide the sum by _N-1_. What do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~868.33}}

@n Take the square root to find the *standard deviation*! @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~29.47}}
