= Standard Deviation

@description{Students learn how standard deviation serves as Data Scientists' most common measure of "spread": how far all the values in a data set tend to be from their mean. When we looked at box plots, we visualized spread based on range and interquartile range. Now we’ll return to histograms and picture the spread in terms of standard deviation.}

== Measuring "Deviance" @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students review the notion of spread itself, and build up to the formula by annotating histograms.

=== Launch
[.lesson-point]
The Animal Shelter Bureau reports that the mean age of shelter cats is 3 years.

[.lesson-instruction]
Does this mean all the cats are close to 3 years old? Why or why not?

Feel free to look at the Animals Dataset in your student workbook, or @opt-online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VeR2_bhpLvnRUZslmCAcSRKfZWs_5RNVujtZgEl6umA/edit?usp=sharing, the Animals Dataset spreadsheet}.

Let's take a look at some cats from our shelter.

- Turn to @printable-exercise{computing-stdev.adoc}, and complete numbers 1-3.
- What did you get for the mean? Does it match what the Animal Shelter Bureau says?
- Can you think of four ages, such that the mean age for all of them is 3?
- Can you think of a _different_ spread of four ages that would have the same mean?
- How many different sets of four ages can you think of, which all have a mean of 3?

_Some possibilities include: {3,3,3,3}, {1,2,4,5}, {1,1,4,6}... any four ages that add up to 12 will work!_

Without a measure of @vocab{spread}, just knowing the mean doesn't tell us enough about the shape of the data. When summarizing a column, we'd like to use a measure that gathers data from every value. We already have one method of measuring spread: calculating the Five Number Summary and using it to generate a box-plot. Unfortunately, that measure comes from only a small number of data points! If possible, we'd like to have a measure that summarizes the spread across _all_ the points.

[.lesson-point]
@vocab{Standard deviation} is the most useful way to summarize @vocab{spread} of a quantitative column.

Instead of focusing on the handful of datapoints used in our Five Number Summary, another way to measure spread is to focus on _the "typical" distance from the mean_. In other words, we want to know what kind of deviation is "standard" for all the points.

=== Investigate

@right{@image{images/histogram-w-mean.png, "A histogram showing the distribution of ages for 10 cats, between the ages of 1 and 8. A star labeling the mean is drawn on the x-axis at 3.", 450}} We could imagine a shelter where every cat is between 2 and 4, so *each cat only deviates from the mean by 1 year*! But we could also imagine a shelter with only kittens and very old cats, where *cats deviate by as much as 10 years from the mean!*


How far away is each data point from 3?

@clear

@right{@image{images/histogram-w-arrows.png, "A histogram showing the distribution of ages for 10 cats, between the ages of 1 and 8. A star labeling the mean is drawn on the x-axis at 3, and  arrows show the distance between the mean and each point in the first interval.", 450}} In this image, we've draw an arrow for each of the 1-year-old cats. That means there are four arrows running from the mean at 3 to the interval at 1, and each arrow has the label 2.

Complete numbers 4 to 6 of @printable-exercise{computing-stdev.adoc}. Now we need to stretch our visual imagination a bit!

- We want to summarize all 10 distances from the mean into a single number. Which one of these seems closest: 1, 2, 4, or 5?
- How did you select the summary number?
- Complete numbers 7-10 of @printable-exercise{computing-stdev.adoc}

=== Synthesize
- Can you explain why two datasets can have the same mean, but different standard deviations?
- What kind of dataset would have a standard deviation of zero?

== Comparing Standard Deviations @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students compare centers and (more importantly) spreads - of two quantitative data sets by comparing their histograms. Both mean and standard deviation can be affected by outliers and/or skewness.

=== Launch
Below is the contract for `stdev`, along with an example that will calculate the standard deviation for the `pounds` column in the animals-table:

```
# stdev :: (t :: Table, col :: String) -> Number
stdev(animals-table, "pounds")
```

What is the standard deviation for the weights of _all_ the animals at our dataset?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Make a histogram showing the ages of *all the cats* in the dataset.
- What is the shape of this histogram?
- How does it differ from the one we just looked at?

@right{@image{images/histogram-with-outlier.png, "A histogram showing the distribution of ages for 10 cats, between the ages of 1 and 8. An 11th cat has been added at 16 years.", 450}} Here is the same histogram we saw before, but now with an 11th cat that is 16 years old. That's quite an outlier!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/effect-of-an-outlier.adoc} to explore the extent to which the inclusion of an outlier will affect the center and spread of a quantitative data set.
- What did this outlier do to the mean?
- What did this outlier do to the standard deviation?
- OPTIONAL: To see how changes in data values affect the mean and standard deviation, complete @opt-printable-exercise{pages/match-mean-stdev-to-dataset.adoc}.

=== Investigate

The mean and standard deviation tell us where the data is centered and how far the data strays from that center. For example, when writing about the ages of cats in our shelter, we might say "the mean age is 3 and the standard devation is 2.4, so most cats are between the ages of 1 and 5 years old."

[.lesson-instruction]
- The mean time-to-adoption is 5.75 weeks. Does that mean most animals generally get adopted in 4-6 weeks?
- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/analysis-stdev-animals.adoc} to get some practice using the Data Cycle to answer this question, then write your findings in the space at the bottom.

=== Synthesize
- How much did adding an outlier change the mean? The standard deviation?
- Extreme values affect both the mean and standard deviation of a data set.
- Unusually low values _decrease_ the mean, while unusually high values _increase_ it. Unusually low or high values increase the standard deviation, because it summarizes distance from the mean in either direction.

== Your Own Analysis @duration{flexible}

=== Overview
Students apply what they've learned to their own dataset.

=== Launch
What is the standard deviation for quantitative columns in _your_ dataset?

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- What is the standard deviation for these columns? Complete @printable-exercise{analysis-stdev-my-dataset.adoc}, and add your findings to the "Measures of Center and Spread" section.
- Do these measures bring up any interesting questions? If so, add them to the end of the document.

=== Synthesize
- Share your findings!
- Are some colums more spread out - with a larger standard deviation - than others?
- What does that mean about your data?
