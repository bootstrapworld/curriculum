# Three Representations of a Function

Open the @starter-file{bc}. You'll see the Contract, some Examples and the Function Definition for `gt`.

What do you notice? What do you wonder?

# Three Representations of a Function

Every function has a contract: {style="font-size:22pt"}


@show{(contract "gt" '("Number" ) "Number")} {style="font-size:22pt"}

# Three Representations of a Function

We can write examples illustrating how a function should work to help us identify the pattern.

# Three Representations of a Function

Function definitions replace whatever changes in the examples with a variable describing what changes.

# Three Representations of a Function

If we use the correct syntax, we can include all three of these function representations in our @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret}@ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme} files. Let's take a look!

* Click *Run*.
@ifproglang{pyret}{
* What message do you get back?{style="font-size:16pt"}
* What do you think that message means?{style="font-size:16pt"}
}
* Change @ifproglang{pyret}{`gt(10) is triangle(10, "solid", "green")` to `gt(15) is triangle(15, "solid", "green")`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`(EXAMPLE (gt 10) (triangle 10 "solid" "green"))` to `(EXAMPLE (gt 10) (triangle 15 "solid" "green"))`}{style="font-size:16pt"}
* Click *Run*. What happens?{style="font-size:16pt"}

# Three Representations of a Function

Examples not only help us to identify the pattern to define a function, they also let us double check that the functions we define do what we intend for them to do!

OPTIONAL: If students feel confident with the Circles of Evaluation but less confident about typing examples, use @opt-printable-exercise{MappingExamplesWithCoE.adoc} to make the connection explicit.

# Defining bc and Other Functions

Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/contracts-examples-definitions.adoc}

* On the top half of the page you will see the contract, examples, and function definition for `gt`. 
* Circle what is changing and label it with the word `size`. 
* Using `gt` as a model, complete the contract, examples and function definition for `bc`.  
* Then type the Contract, Examples and Definition into the Definitions Area. 
* Click *Run*, and make sure all of the examples pass!

As students work, walk around the room and make sure that they are circling what changes in the examples and labeling it with a variable name that reflects what it represents.
