= The Effects of Reforestation: Costa Rica

The good news is that some countries are taking steps to not just put a stop to deforestation, but to replace trees that were cut down previously by reforesting: planting lots of new trees. Costa Rica is one such country. By 1985, Costa Rica’s forest area had gradually decreased, until there was just about 5000 square miles of forest (about one fourth of the country’s total area). 

With the help of its president, Carlos Alvarado, Costa Rica has been committed to gaining back the lost forest area. Let’s simulate their situation by starting with a total forest area of 5000 square miles, to which we ADD 200 square miles each year.

@n What do you notice about the Reforestation chart compared to the deforestation charts we were working with earlier?
