| @span{.title}{Maya Biosphere Reserve: Protecting Forests}
| The Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) in Guatemala is the largest protected area in all of Central America. It was established in 1990 for the purpose of conserving land while still offering ways for the native people there to continue making a living from the forest. One way they can do this without cutting down trees is to harvest and sell “non-timber forest products” like nuts to eat, or palm fronds for floral arrangements.
|
Altogether, the MBR contains about 8,000 square miles---about the size of the entire state of Massachusetts. In some parts of the MBR, where efforts are being made to protect the forest, the annual rate of deforestation is about one hundredth, or 0.01, which means it loses just about 80 square miles of forest each year. This is a relatively low rate of deforestation, compared to other parts of Central America.

_Complete the table below to see how much of the forest will be left after each year if deforestation continues at this rate:_
