@description{In today’s lesson, students will learn that chemical analysis of bones can provide clues about what people ate (diet). Students will be presented with data about the proportion of corn in the bones before 900 A.D. when the ancient Maya were thriving and after 900 A.D when their population began to decline. In the final reading, students will learn that geologic data reveals that deforestation left the land unable to produce enough food (corn).

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* compute averages on Google Sheets to draw conclusions about what happened to the Maya.
* use data and historical research to solve the mystery of the Maya!
* determine appropriateness of various displays and summaries in a given context.

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|
* Let's learn how to calculate averages by hand and using spreadsheets.

=== Overview

=== Launch

- We've looked at skull data from caves to find out who the ancient Maya sacrificed---males or females, adults or children?
- We learned that we make pie charts for categorical data and we can summarize quantitative data using averages.
- We learned that mostly men were sacrificed, and debunked the myth about victims usually being females because of the jewelry.
- Then we saw data about the hieroglyphics and we started to wonder... why did they care so much about the corn god?

Today’s big questions:

- What happened to the ancient Maya?
- Why did they care so much about the Corn God?
- What ELSE can we learn from these bones?

[.lesson-instruction]
We are going to return to the bones… and study something new about them to see if we can get closer to our answers.

=== Investigate

--
- Turn to @printable-exercise{bones.adoc} and follow along as I read the text at the top of the page.
- Answer the questions with your partner.
- If you'd like to find the @vocab{average} using Google Sheets, make a copy of @starter-file{bones}.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
* Turn to @printable-exercise{range-average.adoc}.
* There is a new vocab word defined on this page called @vocab{range}. Range is the difference between the lowest and highest values in the series.
* Let's work together to find the range of corn consumption before 900 AD.
** What's the lowest proportion of corn in the diet before 900 AD? _0.42_
** What's the highest proportion of corn in the diet before 900 AD? _0.62_
** The range is @math{0.62 - 0.42 = 0.2}
* Complete the rest of the page with your partner. You may want to refer back to your copy of @starter-file{bones}.

[.lesson-instruction]
* How did corn consumption before 900AD compare to corn consumption after 900AD?
* Work with your partner to read and complete @printable-exercise{geologists.adoc} to learn more about why the ancient Maya ate less and less corn.

=== Synthesize

* What clues did geologists discover?
* How can we learn about civilizations before there were written records?
** _We can learn about civilizations before written records were kept by looking at artifacts, such as bones, hieroglyphics, etc._
* There were some written records by the Spanish of the Maya. Why might be difficult to learn about the history of the Maya through these records?
** _The written records were written by outsiders, whose biases impacted the accounts._
* What caused the ancient Maya civilization to collapse?
