= Homework (Categorical v. Quantitative Variables)

Directions: Please complete the homework. Use complete sentences.
 
@n Based on the new table you created in todayâ€™s class, are there any conclusions you can make so far about whether the victims of Maya human sacrifices tended to be male or female? Or if they tended to be children or adults? Have you gotten any clues yet about why the Maya civilization collapsed?
