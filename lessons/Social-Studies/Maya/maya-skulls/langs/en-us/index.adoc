= Exploring Data: Skulls from Maya Human Sacrifice

@description{In this lesson students will use human sacrifice as an entry point for learning about Maya society, but will recognize that learning about one practice of the Maya is not enough information to make a broader conclusion about who the Maya were as a people and what led to their downfall.}

| Preparation
|
* You'll need a measuring tape to demonstrate how to measure the circumference of a skull.
* We suggest bringing a stuffed animal or doll as a prop whose head you can measure, rather than measuring a student's head.
* Print and cut sets of skull evidence cards for each pair of students.

Ignite prior knowledge.

Yesterday, we looked at background information, written accounts from Landa and de Las Casas, a recent article about artifacts found in caves, and even analyzed some of the images found in the cave!

[.lesson-instruction]
* Did you learn anything more about the Maya through discussions with family and friends?
* Do you have any new theories about:
** who the Maya sacrificed
** why their civilization collapsed
** how researchers can learn about what Maya society was like in the past

== What Can We Learn from Skulls? @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview

=== Launch

Besides books and written sources, historians and scientists can discover clues about ancient civilizations by digging up bones!

[.lesson-instruction]
--
One measurement archaelogists collect is the circumference of each skull they find.

* What tool would we need? and how would we use it to find the circumference?
--

Demonstrate how to measure the circumference of a skull on a stuffed animal or a student so that everyone has a clear idea of where this measurement might come from.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
* Why do you think it might be useful to know whether a skull is small or large?
** _It might tell us something about the age of the person._
* Turn to your neighbor and come up with some other features we could examine about skulls to see if we can determine their sex and age.  Record your thinking in the table at the top of @printable-exercise{skull-exam.adoc}.

- Turn to @printable-exercise{skull-explore.adoc} and follow the directions to collect and sort your data using google sheets.
- When you're done, complete @printable-exercise{think-like-ds.adoc}

Students will be directed to

. Input the title of each column of your data in Row 1 of your Google Sheet. See below for column titles to include in your data table.
. Work with your partner to input the # of the skull and the skull circumference. You are just filling out Column A and Column B.
. “Sort” your data from smallest by clicking Row 1 so that the entire row is highlighted. Then go to “Data” → “Create a filter”. You should see a downward arrow in the first row of your data table.
. “Sort” your Skull Circumference from smallest to largest by clicking on the down arrow of Column B and selecting “Sort A → Z”. This will organize numbers from smallest to largest.

=== Synthesize
What conclusion(s) can you draw about the Maya based on the skull data you analyzed today? Support your claim with evidence.
