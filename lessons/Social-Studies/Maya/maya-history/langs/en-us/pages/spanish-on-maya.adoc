| The Maya “make use of certain characters or letters, with which they wrote in their books their ancient matters and their sciences, and by these and by drawings... they understood their affairs and... taught [them to others]. We found a large number of these books... and, as they contained nothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all... which caused them great affliction.”_Source:_ [.underline]#Relación de las cosas de Yucatán#
| The Maya books were written with “figures and characters by which they could signify everything they desired; and these great books are of such intelligence and subtle technique that we could say our writing does not offer much of an advantage.” _Source:_ @link{http://www.supportingevidences.net/bartolom-de-las-casas/, suppportingevidences.net}

_Diego de Landa was a Franciscan friar sent to the Yucatán in 1549 as part of Spain’s mission to convert the Maya to Catholicism. In the years to come, he tortured and killed countless Maya in his quest to locate and destroy their idols and temples. He also destroyed thousands of their hieroglyphic books (called codices), so that only three remain in the world today. The few codices not destroyed by the Spanish give us a glimpse at the wisdom and beauty of the ancient Maya culture. The Maya god of maize (corn) appeared in many of their writings and art. In fact, corn was so important to the Maya that humans are depicted as having been created from an ear of corn!_

_Bartolomé de las Casas was a Dominican friar and priest. After initially participating in encomienda (a grant by the Spanish Crown to a colonist in the Americas conferring the right to demand tribute and forced labor from the Native inhabitants of an area), he spent decades of his life actively fighting slavery and the colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike some other priests who sought to destroy the indigenous peoples' native books and writings, he strictly opposed this action. Although he did not completely succeed in changing Spanish views on colonization, his efforts resulted in improvement of the legal status of indigenous people, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism._
