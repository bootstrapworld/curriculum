4) On Day 1 we read a quote from Diego de Landa. De Landa destroyed almost every Maya hieroglyphic text (codex) that existed because he hated their ungodly ways, especially their bloody rituals of human sacrifice. Can we only use De Landa’s writings to learn about the Maya civilization? Explain your answer.

5) Do the pie charts support the article’s statement that the ancient Maya tended to sacrifice prisoners of war? Explain your answer using evidence.
