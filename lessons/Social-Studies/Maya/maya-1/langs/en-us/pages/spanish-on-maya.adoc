| “These people also make use of certain characters or letters, with which they wrote in their books their ancient matters and their sciences, and by these and by drawings and by certain signs in these drawings they understood their affairs and made others understand and taught them. We found a large number of these books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they regretted to an amazing degree and which caused them great affliction.”
| The Mayan books were written with “figures and characters by which they could signify everything they desired; and that these great books are of such intelligence and subtle technique that we could say our writing does not offer much of an advantage.”
