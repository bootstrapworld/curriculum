The bones of six humans, jewelry beads, shells, and stone tools are among the Maya “treasures” recently found in a water-filled cave off a sinkhole (known as a cenote) at the famous archaeological site of Chichén Itzá in Mexico, archaeologists say.

|
The ancient objects are most likely related to a ritual human sacrifice during a time when water levels were lower, sometime between 850 and 1250 A.D., the researchers say.

|
It’s “very improbable” that the remains and artifacts were “just tossed” into the sinkhole, expedition leader Guillermo Anda told National Geographic News in an email. Rather, he said, they were likely placed there during a ceremony to appease the Maya rain god, Chaak.

|
Extending from what is now southern Mexico through Guatemala and into northern Belize, the Maya Empire is noted for having the only known written language in Mesoamerica, as well as for its elaborate works of art and architecture. Chichén Itzá  was one of the greatest Maya cities on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.

|
The discovery of human sacrifice deep in one of the region’s cenotes supports the idea that, for the Maya, the sinkholes “represented thresholds of communication with the spiritual and sacred world that lay under the surface of the Earth,” said Anda, a professor at Autonomous University of Yucatán.

@n What was the purpose of human sacrifice in the Maya culture?

@n Why did the Maya believe that the sinkholes, known as cenotes, were important?

@n Why would the rain god, Chaak, be important to the Mayan people?

@fitb{}{}


@n Given what you already know about the Maya and the information you’ve learned so far, why do you think that the Maya civilization mysteriously collapsed about 600 years before the Spanish arrived?
