| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* identify kinds of objects transported on ships in the South China Seas from 1000-1800
* identify regions of the world that participated in trade in the South China Seas
* make connections to the ways that various types of resources (human capital, physical capital,
and natural resources) are leveraged to provide goods and services in a trade economy

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* I can identify kinds of objects transported on ships in the South China Seas from 1000-1800
* I can identify regions of the world that traded in the South China Seas between 1000-1800

== What were Ships Carrying? @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview

=== Launch

* What part of the world are we currently studying?
* What time period are we currently studying?
* Find the Java Sea shipwreck on the map (hint: it happened near the country of Java). Put a square around the shipwreck once you’ve located it on the map.
* Think about how items move between countries today.
* Do we still use ships?
* What other kinds of vehicles do we use to move items around?
* For different forms of transportation, does the geography of the land matter? How?

=== Investigate

Ships were essential for trade before 1900. If you wanted to buy something from another country, it would arrive on a ship. If you wanted to sell something to another country, it would be sent by ship. The items on ships were what people wanted to buy and sell. We can learn a lot about cultures and values from the contents of ships, so shipwrecks teach us a lot about trade between regions like China and Southeast Asia!

[.lesson-instruction]
Each group should have received a set of @handout{ship-evidence-cards.pdf, Shipwreck Evidence Cards}. The front of each card names a shipwreck. The back of each card lists the regions that the ship was traveling between and what the ship was carrying. With your partner(s), use the cards to complete @printable-exercise{ship-evidence-explore.adoc}.

=== Synthesize

* Which items come up on multiple cards? _ceramics_
* What percentage of the ships carried @vocab{ceramics}?_9 ships with ceramics/10 total ships= 90%_
* Which regions did you see listed? _India, Southeast Asia, Ceylon, England, China, Netherlands_
* Which regions were most active in trade based on the cards? _Southeast Asia/China_

There are different ways to answer this question. You could just @vocab{count} them up and report the numbers. It would be even better to display your results with a picture. An easy way to do this is with what’s called a @vocab{pie chart}!

== Making a Pie Chart in Google Sheets @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students will learn to make and interpret a pie chart from shipwreck @vocab{data} provided as a google sheet.

=== Launch

=== Investigate

Have students make a copy of the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw9WA5aTzUcKUmtWldfZqhHBXKbOzBsURRXHExANPzY/edit?usp=sharing, Shipwreck Trade Region Data} and follow the directions for making a pie chart.

Using the pie chart, have students complete @printable-exercise{trade-region-analyze.adoc}.

=== Synthesize

* Which regions traded the most?
* Which region was involved in more of the routes: the Netherlands or India?
* What can we learn about a culture based on the items found in a shipwreck?
* What evidence or information did we examine today?
* How was @vocab{data science} useful?

== Connecting to Today @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

=== Launch

=== Investigate

Have students complete @printable-exercise{trade-today.adoc}

If you have time, give them the opportunity to research where there three important items are made!

=== Synthesize

* What items are important to us today?
* Where are the items you focused on made?
* How do you think the items are trasnported?
* What are some advantages and disadvantages of importing products from other countries?
