== What Can We Learn from Shipwrecks? @duration{55 minutes}

=== Overview

First, we’ll explore what we can learn from shipwrecks in general. Then, we’ll apply those ideas to study the Java Sea Shipwreck in particular.

=== Launch

A @vocab{shipwreck} is what’s left after a ship sank at sea.

* A ship could break during a storm.
* A ship could sink if it tipped over or filled with water.

Broken ships would sink into the water and land on the seafloor. Items that were on the ships sank with them. There could be money, spices, dishes, weapons, and other things left behind on the ship.

When someone finds a shipwreck, the puzzle begins!

* Which ship was this?
* Where was the ship going?
* When did it sink?

[.lesson-point]
The items found on shipwrecks teach us about history and cultures.

Today, we use the post office and airmail to send items long distances.

Before 1800, however, items traveled long distances by ship instead.


Imagine that you found a shipwreck full of small statues. We could ask:

* “who sent them?”
* “who received them?”
* “why did people want them?”

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students turn to @printable-exercise{know-want-to-know.adoc} where they'll make a list of what we know and want to know about shipwrecks.

=== Investigate

Have students turn to this @printable-exercise{map-shipwrecks.pdf, Map of Major Ancient Shipwreck Sites of Southeast Asia}. The red dots mark locations where shipwrecks were found. Many ships sailed between cities on this map from the 900s through 1800s.

We're going to mark some trade routes on the map. (A straight edge might be helpful.) Draw lines to connect each of the following pairs of locations:

* Guangzhou to the Brunei shipwreck (goes straight south)
* Guangzhou to the Hoi An shipwreck (on the east side of Vietnam)
* Guangzhou to the Pandanan shipwreck (near the northeast side of Brunei, near the Phillipines)
--

Make sure each group has been given a set of 10 @handout{ship-evidence-cards.adoc, Shipwreck Evidence Cards}.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Each of your Shipwreck Evidence Cards has the name and rough location of a shipwreck.

* Using the description of the location on the evidence cards, find (and circle) each shipwreck on the map.
* Then complete @printable-exercise{where-ships.adoc}
--

=== Synthesize

* What can we learn from the location of a shipwreck?
* What evidence or information did we examine today?
