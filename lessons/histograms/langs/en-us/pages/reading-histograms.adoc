Students watched 5 videos, and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10. While the *average score* for every video is the same (5.5), the *shapes* of the ratings distributions were very different! _Match_ the summary description (left) with the _shape_ of the histogram of student ratings (right). For each histogram, *the x-axis is the score, and the y-axis is the number of students who gave it that score*. These axes are intentionally unlabeled - focusing on the _shape_ is what matters here!

| Most of the students were fine with the video, but a couple of them gave it an unusually low rating.

| @centered-image{histogram-a.png, "Histogram with 6 columns whose respective heights from left to right are 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1"}

| Most of the students were okay with the video, but a couple students gave it an unusually high rating.
| *2* @ifsoln{+(C)+} ||*B*
| @centered-image{histogram-b.png, "histogram with 10 bars equal in height"}

| Students tended to give the video an average rating, and they weren't likely to stray far from the average.
|*3* @ifsoln{(A)} ||*C*
| @centered-image{histogram-c.png, "Histogram with 9 bars whose heights from left to right are 0,1,3,3,1,0,0,1,1"}

| Students either really liked or really disliked the video.
|*4* @ifsoln{(E)} ||*D*
| @centered-image{histogram-d.png, "Histogram with 9 bars whose heights from left to right are 0,1,1,0,0,1,3,3,1"}

| Reactions to the video were all over the place: high ratings and low ratings and inbetween ratings were all equally likely.
|*5* @ifsoln{(B)} ||*E*
| @centered-image{histogram-e.png, "Histogram with 11 bars whose heights from left to right are 0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,2"}
