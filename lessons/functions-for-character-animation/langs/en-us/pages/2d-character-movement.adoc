	"takes in danger's x-coordinate and produces the next one")
}

This function takes in the dangerâ€™s x-coordinate and produces the next one, but it doesn't do anything with the y-coordinate. That's why our `DANGER` can only move left or right! Suppose we wanted to change the function, so it updates the character by _moving diagonally_...

@n *Stop and think!* What, if anything, will have to change about the Domain?
@span{.blankline}{ }

@n To move diagonally, we need the function to be aware of both the x _and_ the y-coordinate. It will have to consume both x and y, so the Domain will change to `Number Number`. What other functions have you used that consume two Numbers?
@span{.blankline}{ }

@n *Stop and think!* What, if anything, will have to change about the Range?
@span{.blankline}{ }

The Range can't just be one Number, since an (x, y) coordinate has two Numbers. One idea might be to write the contract this way:

@show{
  (contract "update-danger" '("Number Number") "Number Number"
	"take in danger's x- and y-coordinate, and produces the next x- and next y-coordinate")
}

Unfortunately, that contract breaks an important rule about functions: **Given an input, _all functions must produce one output!_**

Fortunately, our programming language has another data type, called a `Posn`. A `Posn` - short for "position" - is a piece of data that contains two Numbers! We can make a `posn` to represent the position (100, 200) with the following code:

@span{.center}{
@show{ (code '(make-posn 100 200)) }
}

@n On the computer, try making a `Posn` or two. What expression will make a `Posn` representing the origin? @fitb{10em}{@showsoln{(code '(make-posn 0 0))}}

@n Write the contract for the `make-posn` function on the line below.

@ifnotsoln{
@span{.blankline}{}
}

@showsoln{ (contract "make-posn" '("Number Number") "Posn") }

@n On the lines below, write the *new contract and purpose* for `update-danger`, so that it produces a `Posn` instead of a Number.

@ifnotsoln{
@span{.blankline}{}
@span{.blankline}{}
}

@showsoln{
	(contract "update-danger" '("Number Number") "Posn"
		"takes in danger's x- and y-coordinate, and returns a Posn")
}

@n In your game file, change your contract, purpose, examples, and definition to make your `DANGER` and `TARGET` move in two dimensions!
