| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Apply the @vocab{Design Recipe} to create a @vocab{function} given the constraints of a word problem.
* Explain the basics of animation.

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use the Design Recipe to make a function.
* I can describe how animation works.

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Encourage students to take their time in understanding _why_ we want to fix `update-danger` and `update-target`.
* Students might be confused as to _how_ the animation is working.  The `make-game` function at the bottom of the file has many inputs - including `update-danger` and `update-target`. `make-game` takes in all those inputs, including the functions we'll write, and creates the interactive window that we see when we click the "Run" button!

== Animation @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
Students connect the behavior of functions with changing coordinate values, ultimately leading to animation.

=== Launch

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.  Students should have their own *game file* open in a separate window or tab.

- How does a flip-book animation work?
_Each page of the book is slightly different, and the pages go so fast that the motion looks smooth._
- Why do we see movement from still images? +
_Our eyes fill in the gaps between rapidly changing images._

- How might this apply to our game? +
_If we change image @vocab{coordinates} a little bit at a time, they will appear to move._

[.lesson-instruction]
Draw a number line on the board, running from 0 to 1000 (you can also lay tape on the floor, or use a tile floor as a coordinate plane!). Select 2 student volunteers - one to be `TARGET`, one to be `DANGER`.  Start with just `TARGET`.

- Have the class select a starting x- and y-coordinate for the `TARGET`, and have the volunteer move to that position on the number line or coordinate plane.
- The TARGET character moves by 50 (pixels) on each frame of the game.
- When they hear "update target" followed by their current location, the `TARGET` takes a step in the negative direction, moving down the x-axis by 50 (pixels).
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
- We make TARGET move by calling out `(update-target 300)`, `(update-target 250)`, etc.
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
- We make TARGET move by calling out `update-target(300, 200)`, `update-target(250, 100)`, etc.
}
*How quickly could I get TARGET to move across the classroom?*

After practicing with TARGET, add DANGER in.

- `DANGER` takes a step in the _positive direction_ when they hear "update danger" followed by their current x-coordinate.
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
- We make `DANGER` move by calling out `(update-danger 40)`, `(update-danger 39)`, etc.
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
- We make `DANGER` move by calling out `update-danger(40, 92)`, `update-danger(39, 18)`, etc.
}
- On a standard number line, if the `DANGER` is moving to the right, is its x-coordinate increasing or decreasing?

*Practice this a few times with your volunteer, asking the class what their new x-coordinate is each time.* Then have the other students call the update-danger function.

- *What did you notice about the movement of TARGET and DANGER?  What was changing about them?*
+
_Answers will vary: they were moving horizontally, their x-coordinates were changing, they were not moving smoothly, etc._

- *What jobs could we hand over to the computer to make it possible for us to play the game?*
_The computer could handle automatically moving TARGET and DANGER, then we could control the movement of PLAYER._

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- In your saved copy of the @starter-file{game}, examine the `update-danger` function
- Identify the contract, and interpret what the function is currently doing
- Complete the first word problem on @printable-exercise{pages/character-animation-dr.adoc}

When students click the "Run" button, the working `update-danger` function should automatically move the `DANGER` image across the screen!

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students complete the second word problem on @printable-exercise{pages/character-animation-dr.adoc}, with their partner and transfer the code to their Game Starter File.  Click "Run" to see `DANGER` and `TARGET` move across the screen independently!

@span{.title}{Extension Activities}

Once students have successfully gotten `update-target` and `update-danger` working, they can change the functions to make the characters move in whichever direction and whatever speed they want!  They should be sure to modify their purpose statements and examples if they change their functions.
|===


=== Synthesize
Connecting the code to the underlying math is important - especially if you want to customize your game!

- What part of the function controls the character's _speed?_
- What part of the function controls the character's _direction?_
- If you wanted the characters to move in 2 dimensions (diagonally, for example), would anything have to change about the Domain? What about the Range?
