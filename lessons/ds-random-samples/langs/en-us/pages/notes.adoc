= Randomness and Sample Size

Computer Scientists may take *samples* that are subsets of a data set. If their sample is well chosen, they can use it to test if their code does what it's supposed to do. However, choosing a good sample can be tricky!

*Random Samples* are a subset of a population in which each member of the subset has an equal chance of being chosen. A random sample is intended to be a representative subset of the population. The larger the random sample, the more closely it will represent the population and the better our inferences about the population will tend to be.

*Grouped Samples* are a subset of a population in which each member of the subset was chosen for a specific reason.
