@n Open the @starter-file{mood-generator}, and read through the code you find there. This code contains new programming that you haven't seen yet! Take a moment to list everything you Notice, and then everything you Wonder...

|===
| *Notice* 		| *Wonder*
| @ifsoln{(sample responses) I notice a contract and a purpose statement. I see examples. I notice what looks like a function definition, but I see if/else in there}
| @ifsoln{(sample responses) I wonder what if/else are all about...}

@n Add another line of code to the definition for a "mad" mood that produces the _same_ emoji as as an "angry" mood.

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`else if (feeling == "mad"): "ðŸ˜¡"`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`[(string=? feeling "mad") "ðŸ˜¡"]`}
}
@vspace{2ex}

@n Add *another example* for "laughing", using the appropriate emoji.
_(To bring up the emojis on your computer, type `Cmd-Ctrl-Space` on a Mac, or `Windows-Period` on Windows 10.)_

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`mood("laughing") is "ðŸ˜‚"`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`(EXAMPLE (mood "laughing") "ðŸ˜‚")`}
}
@vspace{2ex}

@n Come up with some new moods, and add them to the code. Make sure you include examples!

@ifsoln{(depends on student choice - look for missing quotes, new lines in the definition without lines in the examples, etc.)}

@n In your own words, describe how _piecewise functions_ work in this programming environment.

@ifproglang{pyret}{Every if-expression has a test, which contains a Boolean expression. If the test is true, Pyret evaluates whatever comes after it.}
