@n Open the @starter-file{red-shape}, and read through the code you find there. This code contains new programming that you haven't seen yet! Take a moment to list everything you Notice, and then everything you Wonder...

|===
| *Notice* 		| *Wonder*
| @ifsoln{_(sample responses) I notice a contract and a purpose statement. I see examples.  I notice what looks like a function definition, but I see if/else in there_}
| @ifsoln{(sample responses) I wonder what if/else are all about...}

@n What happens if you click "Run" and type @show{(code '(red-shape "ellipse"))}?

@fitb{}{
	@ifsoln{_It says "Unknown shape name" in red._}
}

@vspace{2ex}

@n Add *another example* for "triangle".

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`red-shape("triangle") is triangle(20 "solid" "red")`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`(EXAMPLE (red-shape "triangle") (triangle 20 "solid" "red"))`}
}

@vspace{2ex}

@n Add another line of code to the definition, to define what the function should do with the input "triangle".

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`else if (shape == "triangle"): triangle(20 "solid" "red")`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`[(string=? shape "triangle") (triangle 20 "solid" "red")]`}
}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Come up with some new shapes, and add them to the code. Make sure you include examples or you will get an error message!

@ifsoln{_(depends on student choice - look for missing quotes, new lines in the definition without lines in the examples, etc.)_}

@n In your own words, describe how _piecewise functions_ work in this programming environment.

@ifsoln{

@fitb{}{
@ifproglang{pyret}{_Every if-expression has a test containing a boolean expression. If the test is true, Pyret evaluates the `then` expression._}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{_There is a list of conditions, each with a boolean expression. If a test is true, WeScheme evaluates the rest of the condition._}}
