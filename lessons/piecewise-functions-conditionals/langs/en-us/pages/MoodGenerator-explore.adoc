@n Open the @starter-file{mood-generator}, and read through the code you find there. This code contains new programming that you haven't seen yet! Take a moment to list everything you Notice, and then everything you Wonder...

[cols="^1,^1", options="header"]
|===
| *Notice* 		| *Wonder*
| @ifsoln{_(sample responses) I notice a contract and a purpose statement. I see examples. I notice what looks like a function definition, but I see if/else in there_}
| @ifsoln{_(sample responses) I wonder what if/else are all about..._}

@n Add another line of code to the definition for a "mad" mood that produces the _same_ emoji as as an "angry" mood.

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`else if (feeling == "mad"): "😡"`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`[(string=? feeling "mad") "😡"]`}
}
@vspace{2ex}

@n Add *another example* for "laughing", using the appropriate emoji.
_(To bring up the emojis on your computer, type `Cmd-Ctrl-Space` on a Mac, or `Windows-Period` on Windows 10.)_

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`mood("laughing") is "😂"`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`(EXAMPLE (mood "laughing") "😂")`}
}
@vspace{2ex}

@n Come up with some new moods, and add them to the code. Make sure you include examples!

@ifsoln{_(depends on student choice - look for missing quotes, new lines in the definition without lines in the examples, etc.)_}

@n In your own words, describe how _piecewise functions_ work in this programming environment.

	@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{_Every if-expression has a test, which contains a boolean expression. If the test is true, Pyret evaluates whatever comes after it._}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{_There is a list of conditionals that begin with boolean expressions. WeScheme checks to see if each of them is true and, if they are, evaluates whatever comes after the boolean expression._}
}

	@ifsoln{_Otherwise, it evaluates whatever comes after the `else`_}
