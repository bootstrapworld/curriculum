== Intro to Piecewise Functions @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to piecewise functions through a kinesthetic activity, and then brainstorm real world applications of piecewise functions.

Decide whether this activity would work better for your class if students stand up and spread out around the classroom or stay in their seats.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
How would you explain a _function_ to someone else? What are some rules that all functions follow?

[.lesson-point]
A function has exactly one output for each input.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Today we are going to act out a special kind of function.
--

Give directions to distinct groups of students so that every student ends up with an activity to perform.

[.lesson-instruction]
* If your birthday is in the summer, make an O with your arms
* If your birthday is in the fall, make an X with your arms or body.
* If your birthday is in the winter, put your hand on your head.
* If your birthday is in the spring, flap your arms like a chicken.

Debrief how students decided what to do. You might do this while students are still in motion or it might work better with your class to stop the activity before discussing it.

_Example Questions: Ask a student with their hands on their head why they aren't flapping their arms like a chicken.
Ask a student making an O with their arms how they knew what to do._

[.lesson-instruction]
* What is the input of the function we just acted out?
* What is the output of the function we just acted out?
* How do we know that you just acted out a function?

_Since each student ("input") has only one action ("output"), it is still a function_.

Up until now, all of the functions students have seen can be described by a single rule. In this activity their behavior followed a _set of rules_ for which each input still had exactly one output. Make a big deal about this, so they recognize how big of a shift this is!

Explain that students have just acted out what is called a _piecewise function_ in math, and a _conditional_ in programming. The world is full of piecewise functions and conditionals!

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Let's try acting out another set of rules.

* Everyone wearing sneakers put your hands on your head.
* Everyone wearing a tshirt make a T with your arms.
* Everyone wearing pants put your hands on your hips.
* Everyone wearing a tshirt make an O with your arms.
--

_Some students should have nothing to do. Others should look confused as to what to do. They may be wearing sneakers and pants and not be able to put their hands on their head and on their hips at the same time. They may be wearing a tshirt and not be able to make a T and an O with their arms simultaneously._

[.lesson-instruction]
This set of rules doesn't seem to have worked quite as well as the last.

Debrief how students decided what to do.

_Example Questions:_

* _Ask a student wearing a tshirt with their arms making an O...I see that you're wearing a tshirt - why aren't you making a T with your arms?_

* _Ask a student wearing pants and sneakers why they don't have their hands on their head and on their hips?_

* _Ask a student who isn't doing anything, Why aren't you doing anything?_

[.lesson-instruction]
A function has exactly one output for each input.
Why doesn't this set of directions represent a function?

_Because people wearing a tshirt were told to do two conflicting things! And people wearing sneakers and pants were told to do two conflicting things!_

=== Investigate

Have students work with their partner to think of examples of piecewise functions.

_Here are a few examples to get you started:_

* Places like movie theaters and museums often have different ticket prices for students, children, and senior citizens. That means the total price can't be determined simply by asking how many tickets there are -- the price-per-person is conditioned on what kind of ticket is being purchased!
* The US Postal Service charges a different rate for differently-sized letters and packages. That means the total price can't be determined just by asking how many things are being mailed -- the price is conditioned on what kind of things are shipped!
* Many phone plans include a certain price-per-gigabyte for data, but only up to a maximum cutoff amout. After that, the price-per-gigabyte gets a lot higher. That means we can't calculate the cost simply by knowing how many gigabytes there are -- the cost is conditioned on what the cutoff is!

=== Synthesize
Share your findings as a class.

_You may also want to discuss whether square root and absolute values are piecewise functions._

@span{.title}{Partial Functions}

Piecewise functions apply different rules over different "pieces" of their domains. But what happens if there's an "empty piece", for which there is no rule?

For Algebra 2 or pre-calculus teachers, this is a useful time to address _partial functions_. These are functions which are undefined over parts of their domain (like division, which is undefined when the denominator is zero). These definitions are independent from one another: a function can be piecewise _and_ partial, just piecewise, or just partial. But partiality comes up much more frequently when defining piecewise functions, because students need to think through all the possible inputs.

In the USPS example, the cost to mail tiny cards is _undefined_ because the postal service doesn't ship packages that are too small.
|===

== Conditionals in Programming @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Having acted out a piecewise function, students take the first step towards writing one, by exploring one or two programs that make use of piecewise functions, developing their own understanding, and modifying the programs.

=== Launch
So far, all of the functions we've written had a _single rule_. The rule for `gt` was to take a number and make a solid, green triangle of that size. The rule for `bc` was to take a number and make a solid, blue circle of that size.

////
The rule for `nametag` was to take a row and make an image of the animal's name in purple letters.
////

What if we want to write functions that apply different rules, based on certain conditions?

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]

- Open the @starter-file{red-shape}.
- Complete @printable-exercise{pages/red-shape-explore.adoc} in your student workbooks.

If you have more time to devote to piecewise functions or students who are ready to dive deeper, have them work with the @opt-starter-file{mood-generator} using @printable-exercise{pages/MoodGenerator-explore.adoc} in their student workbooks. _Students will enjoy getting to use emojis!_

@span{.title}{More than one Way to Define Piecewise Functions!}

There are several conditional expessions in Pyret. For those who are curious, check out this @opt-starter-file{mood-generator-ask}, which makes use of `ask` instead of `if`. Pyret's `ask` construct is similar to the `switch` or `case` statements in other languages. Writing a second Red Shape program using `ask` could be a good extension for some students.
|===
}

=== Synthesize

[.lesson-instruction]
* What happened when you gave `red-shape` a shape that wasn't defined in the program?

_The program told us that the shape was unknown. Think about other functions that don't work when we give them an invalid input, like dividing by zero!_


[.lesson-instruction]
* What is the syntax for writing piecewise functions?

@ifproglang{pyret}{_Pyret allows us to write if-expressions, which contain:_

. _the keyword `if`, followed by a condition._
. _a colon (`:`), followed by a rule for what the function should do if the condition is_ `true`
. _an `else:`, followed by a rule for what to do if the condition is_ `false`

_We can chain them together to create multiple rules, with the last `else:` being our fallback in case every other condition is `false`._
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{_WeScheme allows us to write piecewise functions as follows:_

. _the keyword `cond`, followed by a list of conditions_
. _each condition is a boolean expression, followed by a rule for what the function should do if the condition is_ `true`.
. _ending with an `else` statement, being our fallback in case every other condition is_ `false`.
}

== Extending the Design Recipe @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students think through how much of the Red Shape program we could have written using the Design Recipe.

=== Launch

Let's see how the Design Recipe could help us to write a piecewise function.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
* Turn to @printable-exercise{redshape-dr.adoc}
* How do the Contract and Purpose Statement compare to other Contracts we've seen?

_The Contract and Purpose Statements don't change: we still write down the name, Domain and Range of our function, and we still write down all the information we need in our Purpose Statement (of course, now we have more important information to write - like our condition(s)!)._

[.lesson-instruction]
* How do the examples compare to other examples we've seen?

_The examples are also pretty similar: we write the name of the function, followed by some example inputs, and then we write what the function produces with those inputs._

[.lesson-instruction]
* Circle and label everything that is _change_-able.
* What changes? What did you label?

[.lesson-point]
If there are more unique labels in the examples than there are things in the Domain, we're probably looking at a piecewise function.

In this case, there are more things to circle-and-label in the examples than there are things in our Domain. Think back to our examples of piecewise functions (ticket sales, postage, cell-phone data plans, etc): knowing the input isn't enough - we also need to know the conditions!

[.strategy-box, cols="1", grid="none", stripes="none"]

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note}

Up until now, there's been a pattern that students may not have noticed: the number of things in the Domain of a function was _always_ equal to the number of labels in the example step, which was _always_ equal to the number of variables in the definition. Make sure you explicitly draw students' attention to this here, and point out that this pattern *no longer holds* when it comes to piecewise functions. When it doesn't hold, that's how we _know_ we need a piecewise function!
|===

=== Synthesize

[.lesson-instruction]
* How many examples are needed to fully test a piecewise function with four "pieces"?

_More than two! In fact, we need an example for every option - every "piece"! (And in some cases there is a "default" `else` or `otherwise` option, which we should write an example to test, too!)_

[.lesson-instruction]
* What changes in a piecewise function?

_The input, and also the **rule the function applies to the input**_

== Additional Resources:

If you have more time for working with Piecewise Functions, you may want to have students create a _visual representation_ of how the computer moves through a conditional function.

We also have another program for your students to explore and scaffolded pages to support them through the process!
