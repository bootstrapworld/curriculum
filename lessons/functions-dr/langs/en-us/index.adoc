| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Code should be easy to read! There may be other people looking at your code who could use a hint about what it does, and even the person who wrote the code could benefit from a note here and there. *Comments* are parts of a program that the computer ignores - they are for human eyes only!
* The *purpose statement* is a structured way of restating the problem. In a computer program, it's written as a _comment_ in the code - something the computer doesn't read.
* Remind students that the @vocab{Domain} and @vocab{Range} of a function must be a _set_ of possible inputs and outputs. In math, some of these sets have shorthands like "Integers", "Rationals", etc. In programming, we have shorthands for @vocab{data types} like Number, String, Image, Boolean, etc.
* If students struggle with creating the examples, use the Circle of Evaluation mapping activity or use role-playing to help students build up their understanding around the concept.

== The Design Recipe @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
In this lesson students build on what they already know about multiple representations of functions (contracts, examples and definitions) to write purpose statements and gain fluency with the Design Recipe.

=== Launch

A word problem is a description of a situation, but seeing the math behind the words can be challenging!

In this lesson, you're going to learn a strategy for breaking down word problems, called the *Design Recipe*. You've actually seen most of the steps of the Design Recipe, but you _haven't_ seen how to put them together. There's also one part you haven't seen yet: _writing a purpose statement_.

On its own, a contract is not enough information to generate examples and write a @vocab{function definition}. For example, the contract for `circle` says it needs a Number and two Strings, but that's not the whole story! We can't use negative numbers for the radius, we can only use `"solid"` or `"outline"` for the first String, and the last String has to be a color!

Contracts are great, but we need more detail! Programmers and Mathematicians alike find it helpful to restate a problem in their own words. After all, if you can't explain a problem to someone else, you probably don't understand it yourself!

@span{.title}{Strategies for Reading Comprehension}

_MLR 6: 3 Reads_ - In pairs, the word problem is read 3 times. Students will document their work in the "3 Reads/Stronger & Clearer" handout.

- 1st Read: Teacher reads the word problem. _What is the problem about?_

- 2nd Read: Partner A reads. _What are the quantities?_

- 3rd Read: Partner B reads. _What is a good purpose statement?_
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
* On @printable-exercise{matching-wp-purpose.adoc}, we see four word problems and four @vocab{purpose statements}.
* Take 2 minutes to read them and see if you can find any that describe the same thing and should be matched to each other.
* What pairs did you come up with?
* What do you Notice about those purpose statements? Do they have anything in common?

[.lesson-point]
Purpose statements should have enough details to allow us to write examples without looking at the word problem!

[.lesson-instruction]
* Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/create-examples-contracts-purpose-1.adoc}, read the purpose statements, and write examples that satisfy each of the contracts and purpose statements.
* For more practice, complete @opt-printable-exercise{pages/create-examples-contracts-purpose-2.adoc}.

A good @vocab{purpose statement} must have three things:

. A description of what the function _consumes_

. A description of what the function _produces_

. All the _relevant information_ about how to produce that output

=== Investigate

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{fixing-purpose.adoc} and identify (1) what important information got left out of each of the purpose statements, and (2) what unnecessary information got included!

[.lesson-instruction]
* What important information was missing from each purpose statement that you would need to solve the problem?
* What extra information was included, that wasn't needed to solve the problem?

=== Synthesize
What are the important elements of purpose statements?
Why are purpose statements useful?

@span{.title}{The Design Recipe in your Classroom}

The three steps of the Design Recipe are designed to mirror best practices that you may _already be using in your classroom_. It's merely a collection of those practices, assembled in a structured way with great care taken to connecting each practice with the others.

**Writing the Contract and Purpose Statement is where students _understand_ the word problem.** If you have your students restate the problem in their own words, draw pictures, or underline the inputs and outputs in the word problem, __you're already using this practice!__

**Writing examples and circling-and-labeling what changes is where students _apply_ their understanding** to concrete inputs. If you have your students work through some concrete examples before jumping straight to variables and formulas, and ask them "what's the rule?" or "what's the pattern?", __you're already using this practice!__.

**Writing the definition is where students _formalize and abstract_ this understanding** to work with _any input_. This is where they identify the structure of the rule or pattern, independently of any specific inputs.

The order of the recipe is a recommendation based on 20+ years of research about what works for most students, but that doesn't mean this order works best for _every_ student! Some may find it easier to work through a concrete example or two before thinking about Domain and Range, and there's nothing wrong with that. We encourage you to use the Recipe in your classroom as often as possible, teaching students to be flexible with the tools and representations it includes.

== Rocket Height! @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are given a non-working program, which uses a linear function to determine the height of a rocket after a given length of time. The "broken" code is provided to lower cognitive load, allowing students to focus on comprehension (reading the code) and making use of structure (identifying where it's broken).

=== Launch

Have students open the @starter-file{rocket-height} and look at the code before they click "Run".

[.lesson-instruction]
What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

Have students click "Run" to see the simulation start running on their computer.

[.lesson-instruction]
* What happens when you press the space bar?
** _The seconds change, but the rocket doesn't move!_
* What were you expecting to happen?
** _The rocket would move!_
* What happens when you press `b`?
** _The seconds go back down, but the rocket height stays at 0_
* Is `rocket-height` working?
** _No._
* Close the window with the rocket, so you can see the code.

It would be nice to get a warning when a function doesn't work right!

Let's investigate why we weren't alerted to the problem when the computer checked the function definition against the examples.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Type @show{(code '(rocket-height 0))} into the Interactions Area.
* As the program is currently written, what happens when we give the `rocket-height` function an input of 0?
** _It returns 0._
* Is that what we want it to do?
** _Yes!_
* As the program is currently written, what happens when we give the `rocket-height` function an input of 10?
** _It returns 0._
* Is that what we want it to do?
** _No!_
* Why did the examples pass?
** _The programmer only gave one example! We should always provide at least two examples. More complex functions will require us to think about what range of examples will be necessary to test that our function does what we want it to!_

[.lesson-point]
We should always test a function definition against at least 2 examples!

=== Investigate

Let's use the Design Recipe to fix `rocket-height` and get comfortable with writing @vocab{purpose statements}.

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{pages/rocket-height.adoc}.

As students work, circle the room and make sure that their @vocab{purpose statements} are strong enough that they could write @vocab{examples} without looking at the original word problem. Encourage students to circle what's changing in their examples and label with descriptive @vocab{variables}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Once you've completed the Design Recipe page for `rocket-height`, type the code into Definitions Area, replacing any missing and incorrect code with your own.
- When it's working correctly, explore the other functions in the file.

For students needing more specific instructions about exploring the file, try the following:

- Remove the comment from before the `(start rocket-height)` and test the program.

- Put the comment back in front of `(start rocket-height)`, remove the comment from `(graph rocket-height)`, and test the program.

- Try out `(space rocket-height)`

- Try out `(everything rocket-height)`

=== Synthesize

- What problems did you fix in the starter file?
- What did the other functions do?
- Which step in the Design Recipe are you feeling the most confident about? The least? _At this stage, it is normal for students to feel most confident about the Contract and Examples, and the least confident about Purpose Statements and Definitions._

@span{.title}{Rocket-Height Challenges}

For teachers who cover quadratic and exponential functions or have students who need more of a challenge, here are some fun prompts:

- *Changing slope:* Can you make the rocket fly faster? Slower?
- *Changing sign:* Can you make the rocket sink down instead of fly up?
- *Motivating Quadratic Functions:* Can you make the rocket _accelerate over time_, so that it moves faster the longer it flies?
- *Practicing the Quadratic Formula:* Can you make the rocket blast off _and then land again_?
- *More practice:* Can you make the rocket blast off, _reach a maximum height of exactly 1000 meters_, and then land?
- *More practice:* Can you make the rocket blast off, reach a maximum height of exactly 1000 meters, and then land after exactly 100 seconds?
- *Motivating Exponential Functions:* Can you make the rocket fly to the edge of the the universe?

== Getting the Most out of the Design Recipe

The Design Recipe is not something to use "occasionally": teachers who use it more get far more out of it. We've developed two fun activities for deepening student mastery of the Design Recipe.

* @opt-printable-exercise{dr-telephone.adoc} - __Most computer programs are written by huge teams! It is critical that each team member records their thinking with enough detail for other team members to be able to pick up where they left off. In this activity students collaborate to complete a series of Design Recipe Problems, with each student being responsible for only one part of each problem in the set. The set can be composed of any word problems, but we have provided some here that lend themselves particularly well to the activity, including one set that can be used to collaboratively update the functions in a starter file that will generate a cool mystery image!__

@span{.title}{Teacher Tool: Where'd You Get That?}

Another activity that reinforces the connections between representations is called "Where'd You Get That?", which can also be used by teachers to help students discover Design Recipe problems without pointing out their mistakes.

The activity requires two people: the Challenger, and the Defender. Most of the time, the teacher is in the role of Challenger.

The Challenger starts at the *bottom* of the page, physically pointing to one part of the function definition and asking "Where'd you get that?" The Defender has to _physically point_ to some location in the Examples, and explain exactly how they got that part of the definition.

Once the Defender has shown that they can trace their thinking from Definition to Examples, the game moves to the next stage. The Challenger starts asking about the _Examples_, and now the Defender needs to refer back to the _Contract and Purpose_. This is repeated for every other step in the recipe, as students work their way back to the original word problem. For example:

- *Challenger* (pointing at variable in the Definition): Where'd you get that?
- *Defender* (pointing at label in the Examples): Well, I circled the parts of the Examples that change, and gave them that label.
- *Challenger* (pointing at the label): OK, but where did you get the label?
- *Defender* (pointing at Purpose Statement): I used that term in the Purpose Statement.
- *Challenger* (pointing at Purpose Statement): Where'd you get that term?
- *Defender* (pointing to Word Problem): I got it from reading the Word Problem.
