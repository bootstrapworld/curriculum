| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Given a human-language request for a data display involving the entire Animals Dataset, break it down into parts and generate the display.
* Given a Table, use the `row-n` method to extract any Row from that table
* Given a Row, use the column lookups to extract the value of any column in the Row

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's practice making data displays to answer our questions about the data and retrieving information from tables.

| Preparation
|
* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org (CPO)} and open the "Animals Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can open a new @starter-file{animals}.

== Row Lookups @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to define values in Pyret, and practice by defining Numbers, Strings, and Images. They also learn how to define an individual row from a table in Pyret.

=== Launch
Open your saved Animals Starter File (or make a new @starter-file{animals} copy), and click “Run”.

Sometimes we have a value that we want to use again and again, and it makes sense to define a name for it. Every definition includes a _name_ and a _value_. In the code below, we have definitions for a String, a Number and an Image.

  name = "Flannery"
  age = 16
  logo = star(50, "solid", "red")

* What are the names given in each of these?
**__name, age, and logo__
* What are the values?
** __the String "Flannery", the Number 16, and an Image of a solid red star__

=== Investigate
* How many rows do we need to answer a Lookup question?
** __Just one! Lookups can be answered just by finding the right row!__

(Make sure sure students understand we only need one row!)

What code can we write, to let us define a single row?

Tables have special functions associated with them, called @vocab{Methods}, which allow us to do all sorts of things with those tables. For example, we can get the first data row in a table by using the `.row-n` method:

`animals-table.row-n(0)`

[.lesson-point]
Don't forget: data rows start at index _zero_!

[.lesson-instruction]
In the Interactions Area, use the `row-n` method to get the second and third data rows.

Find `.row-n` in your Contracts page. What is the Domain of `.row-n`? What is the Range?

A table @vocab{method} is a special kind of function which always operates on a specific table. `A.row-n(0)` and `B.row-n(0)` will return different rows, if A and B are different tables.

[.lesson-instruction]
How would you get the _second_ row out of the animals table? The third?

The code below will define the first row from the animals table:

`sasha = animals-table.row-n(0)`

It's often better to name our Row definitions according to the _property we care about_. In this case, the fact that this row is a cat is _much_ more interesting than the fact that her name is Sasha:

`cat-row = animals-table.row-n(0)`

[.lesson-instruction]
- In the Animals Dataset, there are subsets that we might want to analyze: dogs, cats, lizards, old animals, young ones, etc.
- Complete @printable-exercise{pages/defining-rows.adoc}.
- When you're done, open your saved Animals Starter File (or make a new @starter-file{animals} copy) and add these definitions after the definitions for `dog-row` and `cat-row`.

[.lesson-point]
The rows you added will be used later!


=== Synthesize
- We named rows by a lot of different properties (e.g. - their species, sex, etc). What are some other properties of rows in this dataset that we could use?
- What are some properties of **your dataset** that you might want to define rows for?

== Column Lookups @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to access a particular column from a row.

=== Launch
We can also access _columns_ of a Row, by using a *Row Accessor*. Row accessors start with a Row value, followed by square brackets, and the name of the column where the value can be found. Here are three examples that use row accessors to get at different columns from the first row in the animals-table:

  animals-table.row-n(0)["name"]
  animals-table.row-n(0)["age"]
  animals-table.row-n(0)["fixed"]

And of course, we can use our defined name, substituting it in place of all the redundant code:

  cat-row["name"]
  cat-row["age"]
  cat-row["fixed"]

=== Synthesize
- Why is it important to be able to define individual rows?
