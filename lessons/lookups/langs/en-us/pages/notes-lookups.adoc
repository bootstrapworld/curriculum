= Looking up Rows and Columns

We can define names for values in Pyret, the same way we do in math:

```
name = "Flannery"
age = 16
logo = star(50, "solid", "red")
```

When *looking up a data Row* from a Table, programmers use the `row-n` method. This method takes a single number as its input, which tells the computer which Row we want. _Note: Rows are numbered starting at zero!_

For example:
```
sasha   = animals-table.row-n(0)  # define Sasha to be the first row
mittens = animals-table.row-n(2)  # define Mittens to be the third row
```

When we define these rows, it's more useful to name them based on their _properties_, rather than their identifiers:
```
cat-row = animals-table.row-n(0)  # Sasha is a cat
dog-row = animals-table.row-n(10) # Toggle is a dog
```

When *looking up a column* from a Row, programmers use square brackets and the name of the column they want.

For example:
```
# these two lines do the same thing! We can use the defined name to simplify our code
animals-table.row-n(0)["age"]  # look up Sasha's age (in row 0)
cat-row["species"]             # look up Sasha's age (using the defined name)
dog-row["age"]				   # look up Toggle's age (using the defined name)
```
