= Practice Plotting

Use Pyret to make the following displays, then write the code on the blank line below:

@vspace{2ex}

@n A `pie-chart` showing the `species` of animals from the shelter.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`pie-chart(animals-table, "species")`}}

@n A `bar-chart` showing how many animals are fixed or not.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`pie-chart(animals-table, "fixed")`}}

@n A `histogram` of the number of `pounds` that animals weigh.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`histogram(animals-table, "pounds", 10)`}}

@n A `box-plot` of the number of `weeks` that it takes animals to be adopted.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`box-plot(animals-table, "weeks")`}}

@n A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `name` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `pounds` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`scatter-plot(animals-table, "name", "age", "pounds")`}}

@n A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `species` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`scatter-plot(animals-table, "species", "age", "weeks")`}}

@n (Challenge) An `lr-plot`, using the animals `species` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`lr-plot(animals-table, "species", "pounds", "weeks")`}}
