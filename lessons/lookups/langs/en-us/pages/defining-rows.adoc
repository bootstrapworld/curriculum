We've already given you two row definitions: `cat-dog` and `dog-row`:

```
cat-row = row-n(animals-table,  0)  # Sasha is a cat
dog-row = row-n(animals-table, 10) # Toggle is a dog
```

**Remember: rows start at index zero!** Use this to answer the questions below.

[cols="15,^1", frame="none", grid="none"]
