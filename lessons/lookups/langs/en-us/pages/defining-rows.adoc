We've already given you two row definitions: `cat-dog` and `dog-row`:

```
cat-row = row-n(animals-table,  0)  # Sasha is a cat
dog-row = row-n(animals-table, 10) # Toggle is a dog
```

**Remember: rows start at index zero!** Use this to answer the questions below.

@n The index of a row containing a lizard is 					@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing a rabbit is 					@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing a fixed animal is 				@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing a male animal 					@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing a female animal is 			@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing a hermaphroditic animal is 	@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing an unfixed animal is 			@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing a young animal (<2 years) is 	@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
@n The index of a row containing an old animal (>10 years) is 	@right{@fitb{5em}{}}
