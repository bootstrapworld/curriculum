= Do NYC Schools Reflect the City's Diversity?

The following data comes from a report from @link{https://council.nyc.gov/data/school-diversity-in-nyc/#tech-appendix, New York City Council}, which begins, "After the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, integrating public schools became a nationwide objective." A look at the data led policy makers to pass some new laws. What do you notice and wonder as you look at the pie charts below?

*What information can we learn by comparing these pie charts that couldn't be learned from the schools pie chart alone?*
