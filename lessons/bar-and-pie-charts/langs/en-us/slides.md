# Pie and Bar Charts

@left{@image{images/legsp.png,"A pie chart showing how many animals have each number of legs", 300}}

Here is the @vocab{Contract} for a function that makes @vocab{pie charts}:

@show{(contract "pie-chart" '("Table" "String") "Image" )}

And here is an example of _using_ the function:

`pie-chart(animals-table, "legs")`

<!--

{layout="Launch"}
# Pie and Bar Charts

`pie-chart(animals-table, "legs")`

- What is the Name of this function?
- How many inputs are in its @vocab{Domain}?
- In the Interactions Area, type `pie-chart(animals-table, "legs")` and hit "Enter". What happens?

# Pie and Bar Charts

Hovering over a pie slice reveals the label, as well as the count and the percentage of the whole. In this example we see that there is 1 animal with 0 legs, representing 3.1% of the population.

We can also resize the window by dragging its borders. This allows us to experiment with the data before closing the window and generating the final, non-interactive image.

# Pie and Bar Charts

`pie-chart` consumes a Table of data, along with the _name of a *categorical* column you want to display_. The computer counts the number of times that each value appears.

Then it draws a slice for each value, with the size being the percentage of cells with that value.

This pie chart shows the distribution of the number of `legs` across the shelter.

Can you make a pie chart for the `sex` column?

<!--
When students make a display of the `sex` of the animals, they will see that some animals are male, some are female and some are hermaphrodites. We use the descriptor _sex_ rather than _gender_ because sex refers to biology, whereas gender refers to identity. Hermaphrodite is the biological term for animals that carry eggs & produce sperm (nearly 1/3 of the non-insect animal species on the planet!). Plants that produce pollen & ovules are also hermaphrodites. While the term was previously used by the medical community to describe intersex people or people who identify as transgender or gender non-binary, it is not biologically accurate. Humans are not able to produce both viable eggs and sperm, so "hermaphrodite" is no longer considered an acceptable term to apply to people.

# Pie and Bar Charts

Here is the @vocab{Contract} for another function, which makes @vocab{bar charts}:

@show{(contract "bar-chart" '("Table" "String") "Image" )}

- Which column of the animals table tells us which species the animal is?
- Use `bar-chart` to make a display showing how many animals there are of each species.

# Pie and Bar Charts

- Experiment with pie and bar charts, passing in different column names. If you get an error message, _read it carefully!_
- What do you think are the rules for what kinds of columns can be used by _bar-chart_ and _pie-chart_?
- When would you want to use one chart instead of another?
- Complete @printable-exercise{matching-bar-to-pie.adoc}.



<!--
To dig deeper into pie charts and bar charts, have students complete @opt-printable-exercise{bar-and-pie-notice.adoc}. They can also focus on one display at a time using @opt-printable-exercise{pie-chart-notice.adoc} or @opt-printable-exercise{bar-chart-notice.adoc}.

# Pie and Bar Charts

* What strategies did you use to match the bar charts to the pie charts?
* Which displays do you find it easier to interpret? Why?
* What information is provided in bar charts that is hidden in pie charts?
* Why might this sometimes be problematic?

<!--
Common Misconceptions

* Pie charts and bar charts can show _counts_ or _percentages_ of categorical data. If there are more people with brown hair than blond hair, for example, a pie chart of hair color will have a larger slice or longer bar for "brown" than for "blond". In Pyret, pie charts show percentages, and bar charts show counts.
* A pie chart can only display one categorical variable, but a bar chart might be used to display two or more. Pie charts have a wedge for each represented category. Unlike in bar charts, empty categories will not be included in a pie chart. When comparing bar charts, it is important to read the scales on the y-axes. If the scales do not match, a taller bar may not represent a larger value.
* Bar charts look a lot like another kind of chart - called a "histogram" - which are actually quite different because they display _quantitative_ data, not categorical. This lesson focuses entirely on pie- and bar charts.

# Pie and Bar Charts

Bar Charts and Pie Charts are mostly used to _display categorical columns_.

While bars in some bar charts should follow some logical order (alphabetical, small-medium-large, etc), the pie slices and bars can technically be placed in _any_ order, without changing the meaning of the chart.

# Exploring other Displays

There are _lots_ of other functions, for all different kinds of data displays. 

Even if you donâ€™t know what these plots are for yet, see if you can use your knowledge of Contracts to figure out how to use them!

# Exploring other Displays

Complete @printable-exercise{pages/exploring-displays-1.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/exploring-displays-2.adoc}.

<!--
There are _many_ possible misconceptions about displays that students may encounter here. *But that's ok!* Understanding all those other plots is _not_ a learning goal for this lesson. Rather, the goal is to have them develop some loose familiarity, and to get more practice reading Contracts.

Have students share their answers and discuss.
