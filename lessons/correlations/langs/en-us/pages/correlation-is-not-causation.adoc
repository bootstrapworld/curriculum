= Correlation Does Not Imply Causation!

Here are some possible correlations and the nonsense headlines a confused journalist might report as a result.  In reality, the correlations have absolutely no causal relationship; they come about because both of them are related to another variable thatâ€™s lurking in the background.

*Can you think of another variable for each situation that might be the actual cause of the correlation and explain why the headlines the paper ran based on the correlations are nonsense?*

*Correlation:* For a certain psychology test, the amount of time a student studied was negatively correlated with their score! 
 
*Headline:* "Students who study less do better!"
