= Summarizing Columns in the Animals Dataset

Find the measures of center and spread to summarize the @fitb{20ex}{pounds} column of the Animals Table. 

Be sure to add examples to your Contracts page as you work.

@vspace{1ex}

== Measures of Center

The three measures of center for this column are: 

@vspace{1ex}

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"] 
|===

| Mean (Average)| Median | Mode(s)

| `approx. 39.7` 	| `11.3` | `[list: 0.1, 6.5]`
|===

@vspace{1ex}

Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{higher}{[higher/lower/about equal]} compared to the median, this suggests the shape is @fitbruby{60ex}{skewed right}{[skewed right (or high outliers) / skewed left (or low outliers) / symmetric]}.

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum | Q1 		| Median 	| Q3 	| Maximum

| 0.1	  | 3.9		| 11.3		| 60.4 	| 172

== Displaying Center and Spread with a Box Plot

Draw a box plot from this summary on the number line below. 

Be sure to label the number line with consistent intervals.

From this summary and box-plot, I conclude:

@span{.blankline}{_While the animals' weights range from 0.1 pounds to 172 pounds,_}

@span{.blankline}{_50% of the animals weigh 11.3 pounds or less. The animal that_}

@span{.blankline}{_weighs 172 pounds may be an outlier._}

@span{.blankline}{}
