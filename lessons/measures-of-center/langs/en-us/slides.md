# Mean

**According to the Animal Shelter Bureau, the average pet weighs almost 41 pounds.**

Some medicines are dosed by weight: heavier animals need a larger dose that could be dangerous for smaller animals. 

If someone from the shelter needs to give a dose of medicine to the animals, **is the “average” the best estimate we can use**?

# Mean

“The average pet weighs 41 pounds” is a statement about the entire dataset, which summarizes a whole column of values with a single number. 

Summarizing a big dataset means that some information gets lost, so it’s important to pick an appropriate summary. Picking the wrong summary can have serious implications!

# Mean

- Students are sometimes summarized by two numbers -- their GPA and SAT scores -- which can impact where they go to college or how much financial aid they get.{style="font-size:14pt"}
- Schools are sometimes summarized by a few numbers -- student pass rates and attendance, for example -- which can determine whether or not a school gets shut down.{style="font-size:14pt"}
- Adults are often summarized by a single number -- like their credit score -- which determines their ability to get a job or a home loan.{style="font-size:14pt"}
- When buying uniforms for a sports team, a coach might look for the most common size that the players wear.{style="font-size:14pt"}

_Can you think of other examples where someone uses a number or two to summarize something complex?_

<!--
Every kind of summary has situations in which it does a good job of reporting what’s typical, and others where it doesn’t really do justice to the data. In fact, the shape of the data can play a huge role in whether or not one kind of summary is appropriate!

# Mean

One of the ways that Data Scientists summarize quantitative data is by talking about its _center_ - literally asking "what is a typical value in this sample?", in the hopes of inferring something about a larger population.

**But there are many different ways to define "center", and each method has strengths and weaknesses.**

# Mean

* Open your saved @starter-file{animals}, or make a new copy.

If we plotted all the pounds values as points on a number line, what could we say about the **average** of those values? Is there a **midpoint**? Is there a point that shows up **most often**? Each of these are different ways of “measuring center”.

# Mean

The mean of a dataset is the sum of values divided by the number of values. To take the average of a column, we add all the numbers in that column and divide by the number of rows.

Pyret has a way for us to compute the mean of any quantitative column in a Table:

@show{ (contract "mean" '("Table" "String") "Number" )}

What is the function's name? Domain? Range?

<!--
Notice that calculating the mean requires being able to add and divide, so the mean only makes sense for quantitative data. For example, the mean of a list of Presidents doesn’t make sense. Same thing for a list of zip codes: even though we can divide a sum of zip codes, the output doesn’t correspond to some “center” zip code.
-->

# Mean

- Type `mean(animals-table, "pounds")`. 
- What does this give us?
- Does this support the Bureau’s claims?
- Open your workbooks to @printable-exercise{summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}. In the “measures of center” section, *fill in the computed mean.*

# Median

You computed the mean of that column to be almost exactly 41 pounds, but if we look at the dataset we'll quickly see that most of the animals weigh less than 41 pounds! 

In fact, more than half of the animals weigh less than _15 pounds_. What is throwing off the average so much?

<!--

-->

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Median

_Kujo and Mr. Peanutbutter!_

In this case, the mean is being thrown off by a few extreme data points. These extreme points are called @vocab{outliers}, because they fall far outside of the rest of the dataset. 

Calculating the mean is great when all the points are fairly balanced on either side of the middle, but it distorts things for datasets with extreme outliers. 

The mean may also be thrown off by the presence of @vocab{skewness}: a lopsided shape due to values trailing off to the left or right.
<!--

-->

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Median

Make a `histogram` of the `pounds` column, and try different bin sizes. Can you see the huge number of animals clumped to the left, with Kujo and Mr. Peanutbutter as outliers skewed to the right? 

A different way to measure center is to line up all of the data points -- in order -- and find a point in the center where half of the values are smaller and the other half are larger. This is the @vocab{median}, or “middle” value of a list.

<!--

# Median

Consider this list of ACT scores:

`25, 26, 28, 28, 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 31, 32`

Here 29 is the median, because it separates the "bottom half” (5 values below it) from the top half” (5 values above it).

The algorithm for finding the median of a quantitative column is:

1. Sort the numbers{style="font-size:16pt"}
2. Cross out the highest and lowest numbers{style="font-size:16pt"}
3. Repeat until there is only one number left. If there are two numbers left at the end, take the _mean_ of those numbers{style="font-size:16pt"}

# Median

* Pyret has a function to compute the median of a list as well. Find the contract in your contracts page.
* Compute the median for the `pounds` column in the Animals Dataset, and add this to @printable-exercise{summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}.
* Is it different than the mean?
* What can we conclude when the mean is so much greater than the median?
* For practice, compute the mean and median for the weeks and age columns.

# Median

By looking at the histogram, we can see that it's probably better to use the mean or median.

Strong left skewness and/or low outliers can pull the mean down below the median, while right skewness and/or high outliers can pull it up above the median. 

Mean is generally the best measure of center, because it includes information from every single point. But it's inaccurate for highly-skewed datasets, so statisticians fall back to the median.

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Modes

The third measure of center is called the @vocab{modes} of a dataset. The @vocab{modes} of a dataset are the values that appear _most often_. 

Median and Mean always produce one number, but if two or more values are equally common, there can be more than one mode. If all values are equally common, then there is no mode at all! 

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Modes

 Consider the following three datasets:
```
  1, 2, 3, 4
  1, 2, 2, 3, 4
  1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4
```

- The first dataset has no mode at all!{style="font-size:14pt"}
- The mode of the second dataset is 2, since 2 appears more than any other number.{style="font-size:14pt"}
- The modes (plural!) of the last dataset are 1 and 4, because 1 and 4 both appear more often than any other element, and because they appear equally often.{style="font-size:14pt"}
---
{layout="Launch"}
# Modes

In Pyret, the mode(s) are calculated by the modes function, which consumes a Table and the name of the column you want to measure, and produces a _List_ of Numbers.

@show{ (contract "modes" '("Table" "String") "List" )}

---
{layout="Investigate"}
# Modes

Compute the `modes` of the `pounds` column, and add it to @printable-exercise{pages/summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}. What did you get?

---
{layout="Synthesize"}
# Modes

The most common number of pounds an animal weighs is 6.5! That’s well below our mean and even our median, which is further evidence of outliers or skewness.

At this point, we have a lot of evidence that suggests the Bureau’s use of “mean” to summarize animal weights isn’t ideal.

---
{layout="Synthesize"}
# Modes

We have three reasons to suspect that @vocab{mean} isn’t the best value to use:

- The median is only 13.4 pounds.
- The mode of our dataset is only 6.5 pounds, which suggests a cluster of animals that weigh less than one-sixth the mean.
- When viewed as a histogram, we can see the right skewness and high outliers in the dataset. Mean is sensitive to datasets with skewness and/or outliers.

# Modes

**“In 2003, the average American family earned $43,000 a year -- well above the poverty line! Therefore very few Americans were living in poverty."**

Do you trust this statement? Why or why not? Consider how many policies or laws are informed by statistics like this! Knowing about measures of center helps us see through misleading statements.

---
{layout="Synthesize"}
# Modes

When should each measure of center be used?

- If the data doesn’t show much skewness or have outliers, @vocab{mean} is the best summary because it incorporates information from every value.
- If the data has noticeable outliers or skewness, @vocab{median} gives a better summary of center than the mean.
- If there are very few possible values, such as AP Scores (1–5), the @vocab{mode} could be a useful way to summarize the dataset.
<!--
*NOTE:* We strongly recommend having students practice the Data Cycle with measures of center, using @opt-printable-exercise{pages/data-cycle-practice.adoc}. Sometimes what's created isn't a table _or_ a display, and this activity demonstrates that. It also drives home an important difference between Arithmetic and Statistical Questions.
