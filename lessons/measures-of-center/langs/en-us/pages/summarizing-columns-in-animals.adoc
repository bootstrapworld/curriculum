Find the measures of center and spread to summarize the @fitb{20ex}{pounds} column of the Animals Table. 

Be sure to add examples to your Contracts page as you work.

== Measures of Center

The three measures of center for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median 	| Mode(s)
| 				 |			|
|===

Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{}{higher/lower/about equal} compared to the median, this suggests the shape is @fitbruby{60ex}{}{skewed right (or high outliers) / skewed left (or low outliers) / symmetric}.

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum | Q1 	| Median | Q3 | Maximum
|		  |		|		 |	  |
|===


== Displaying Center and Spread with a Box Plot

Draw a box plot from this summary on the number line below. 

Be sure to label the number line with consistent intervals.
