Consider the following dataset, representing the heaviest bench press (in
lbs) for ten powerlifters:

----
135, 95, 230, 135, 203, 55, 1075, 135, 110, 185
----

@n In the space below, rewrite this dataset in sorted order.

@ifsoln{55, 95, 110, 135, 135, 135, 185, 203, 230, 1075}

@n In the table below, compute the measures of center for this dataset.

@n The following statements are correct ... but misleading. Write down the
reason why.

[.misleading, cols="1a,3a",options='header']
|===
| Statement | Why it’s misleading

| “More personal records are set at 135 lbs than any other weight!”
| @ifsoln{This statement seems to imply that 135 pounds is a really common personal record. While the mode IS 135, the wide distribution of possibly weights makes mode a poor measure of center.}

| “The average powerlifter can bench press 235 lbs.”
| @ifsoln{This statement leads us to expect that at least half of all powerlifters can bench 235 pounds or more. In fact, half the powerlifters in this sample lift a _maximum_ of 135 pounds! The average is thrown off by an exteme outlier, who benched 1075 pounds!}

| “With a median of 135, that means that half the people in this group can’t even lift 135 lbs.”
| @ifsoln{The median is the "middle number" in the dataset, but that doesn't mean half the values are less and the other half are greater! In fact, this dataset contains _three_ values that are 135, meaning that only 4-out-of-10 cannot lift 135 pounds.}
