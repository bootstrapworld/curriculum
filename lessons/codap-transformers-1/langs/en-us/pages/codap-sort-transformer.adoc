= Sort Transformer

Make sure youâ€™re logged into CODAP with the Animals Dataset open. Open the Transformers plugin, and select `Sort`.

== Creating a Sort Transformer

- Select `Sort` from the drop-down menu of Transformers.
- We want to give each Transformer a useful name, one which clearly describes what that Transformer does. Generally, a brief hyphenated description works - for instance: `order-by-pounds`.

@n What would be a good name for a Transformer that organizes the table alphabetically by animals' names?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_order-by-name._}}

- Type in your designated name.

@n Which dataset do you want CODAP to apply this Transformer to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Animals Dataset_}}

- Select the appropriate dataset from the drop-down menu.
- Select `Name` as the attribute to sort.

@n Which direction will you select? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_"Ascending" sorts from A to Z, so I will select that._}}

== Applying and Saving the Sort Transformer

@n Apply the Transformer. What happens?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_A copy of the original dataset is created._}}

@n What do you notice about the name of the new dataset?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_It has `Sort`, the Transformer name, at the front, with the name of the original dataset in parentheses._}}

@n What happens when you save a Transformer?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_When I save a Transformer, a small box appears that has my Transformer's name at the top. I will now be able to use the Transformer again, without inputting all of the different specifications._}}

@n How is saving a Transformer different from saving a dataset?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Saving a dataset saves the table, but not the operations performed on it. Saving a transformer lets us re-use an operation._}}
