= Using Transformers: Sort, Filter, Transform Attribute, Build Attribute

*Transformers* allow us to transform datasets to produce new, distinct output datasets, instead of modifying the original input dataset itself. We use them to manipulate tables and enable low-stakes "what if?" exploration.

- In this course, we'll be using a variety of Transformers.

** `Sort` - We must provide `Sort` with a dataset, a sort method (we'll focus on sorting by attribute in this course), and a sort direction. `Sort` produces a copy of the input dataset, with cases sorted by the selected attribute.
** `Filter` - We must provide `Filter` with an expression that evaluates to either true or false. `Filter` then produces a copy of the input dataset that only has the cases for which the formula was true.
** `Transform Attribute` - We provide `Transform Attribute` with an attribute to transform, a new name for the transformed attribute, and an expression to apply to each row. The `Transform Attribute` replaces the value of the designated attribute with the result of the expression. `Transform Attribute` produces a copy of the input dataset with the designated row transformed.
** `Build Attribute` - We provide an expression that is used to calculate an attribute's new values. `Build Attribute` produces a copy of the input dataset with the new attribute added.

- With the exception of `Sort`, each of the above Transformers is attached to a unique expression. It's important to get the expression just right, or the Transformer will produce an error. Strings belong inside quotation marks, but Booleans do not! Attribute names that include units (for instance, `Age (years)`) belong inside tick marks (`).
