Fill in the tables, predict what the graph will look like (a rough sketch is fine!), and then use CODAP to make the following displays.

@n A histogram of the number of `pounds` that animals weigh.

@n A scatter-plot, using the animals `name` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `pounds` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.
