* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs
* Computer for each student (or pair), with access to the internet* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Animals Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson.

== Design Recipe Practice @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students practice more of what they learned in the previous lesson, applying the Design Recipe to simple table functions that operate on rows of the Animals Dataset. The functions they create - in addition to the ones they've already made - set up the method-chaining activity.

=== Launch
The Design Recipe is a powerful tool for solving problems by writing functions. It's important for this to be like second nature, so let's get some more practice using it!

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Define the Compute functions on @printable-exercise{pages/design-recipe-1.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/design-recipe-2.adoc}.

@span{.title}{Optional: Combining Booleans}

Suppose we want to build a table of Animals that are fixed _and_ old, or a table of animals that are cats _or_ dogs?

By using the `and` and `or` operators, we can _combine_ boolean tests, as in: `(1 > 2) and ("a" == "b")`. This is handy for more complex programs! For example, we might want to ask if a character in a video game has run out of health points _and_ if they have any more lives. We might want to know if someone’s ZIP Code puts them in Texas or New Mexico. When you go out to eat at a restaurant, you might ask what items on the menu have meat and cheese.

For many of the situations where you might use `and`, there's actually a much more powerful mechanism you can use, called "Method Chaining"!

=== Synthesize
Did students find themselves getting faster at using the Design Recipe? Can students share any patterns they noticed, or shortcuts they used?

== Chaining Methods @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to perform multiple table operations (sorting, filtering, building) in the same line of code.

=== Launch
Now that we are doing more sophisticated analyses, we might find ourselves writing the following code:
----
# get a table with the nametags of all the fixed animals, ordered by species
with-labels = animals-table.build-column("labels", nametag)
fixed-with-labels = with-nametags.filter(is-fixed)
result = fixed-with-labels.order-by("species", true)
----

That's a lot of code, and it also requires us to come up with names for each intermediate step! Pyret allows table methods to be _chained together_, so that we can build, filter _and_ order a Table in one shot. For example:

----
# get a table with the nametags of all the fixed animals, ordered by species
result = animals-table.build-column("labels", nametag).filter(is-fixed).order-by("species", true)
----

This code takes the `animals-table`, and builds a new column. According to our Contracts Page, `.build-column` produces a new Table, and that’s the Table whose `.filter` method we use. That method produces _yet another Table_, and we call that Table’s `order-by` method. The Table that comes back from that is our final result.

@span{.title}{Teaching Tip}

Use different color markers to draw _nested boxes_ around each part of the expression, showing where each Table came from.
|===

It can be difficult to read code that has lots of method calls chained together, so we can add a line-break before each “`.`” to make it more readable. Here’s the exact same code, written with each method on its own line:

----
# get a table with the nametags of all the fixed animals, order by species
animals-table
  .build-column("label", nametag)
  .filter(is-fixed)
  .order-by("species", true)
----

[.lesson-point]
Order matters: Build, Filter, Order.

Suppose we want to build a column and then use it to filter our table. If we use the methods in the wrong order (trying to filter by a column that doesn’t exist yet), we might wind up crashing the program. Even worse, the program might work, but produce results that are incorrect!

=== Investigate
[.lesson-point]
When chaining methods, it’s important to build first, then filter, and then order.

How well do you know your table methods? Complete @printable-exercise{pages/chaining-methods.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/chaining-methods-order-matters.adoc} in your Student Workbook to find out.

=== Synthesize
As our analysis gets more complex, method chaining is a great way to keep the code simple. But complex analysis also has more room for mistakes, so it’s critical to think carefully when we use it!
