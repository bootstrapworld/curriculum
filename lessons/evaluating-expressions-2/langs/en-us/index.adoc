== Expressions with Exponents and Negatives @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students apply Circles of Evaluation to analyze expressions with exponents and negatives, later extending their knowledge to evaluate expressions with variables, exponents, and negatives.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Analyze these expressions: @math{-3^2}, @math{(-3)^2}, and @math{-(3^2)}
- Are any of these three expressions equivalent? How do you know? Draw Circles to help you.
** _We know that in an expression with no grouping symbols, we evaluate the exponent first - before the negation. Therefore, the first and third expression are equivalent; they both evaluate to @math{-9}. The second expression evaluates to @math{9}. See Circles below._

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at the three-column table on Variable Expressions with Exponents and Negatives.
- Either draw a Circle to match the expression, or write an expression to match the Circle.
- Once you have completely filled in the first and second column, move to the third column, where you will evaluate each expressions by substituting in the given value.
- Finally, try evaluating variable expressions with exponents and negatives on this worksheet.

=== Synthesize

- If an expression has no grouping symbols, which do we apply first: `num-expt` or
`negate`?
** _First, we apply `num-expt`, then `negate`._

== Identifying Patterns with Circles @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students use Circles of Evaluation to identify patterns that emerge when we apply exponents with negatives.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look over the table on this worksheet. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible responses: They all involve a base of 2, a negation, and an exponent. There are no grouping symbols. I wonder what they will evaluate to?_
- Draw a Circle of Evaluation for each of the expressions. What do you notice and wonder, now?
** _Possible responses: I see that they will all have a negative result. As the exponent increases, the outcome will become more and more negative._
