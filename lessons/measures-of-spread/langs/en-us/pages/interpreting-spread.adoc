= Interpreting Spread

// use double-space before the *bold* text to address a text-kerning bug in wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 (with patched qt)
Consider the following dataset, representing the annual income of ten people.

All numbers represent __thousands of dollars__ (so `14` means "$14,000"):

  60, 10, 21, 180, 14, 20, 45, 35, 45, 170

1) In the space below, rewrite this dataset in  *sorted order*.

@ifsoln{_10, 14, 20, 21, 35, 45, 45, 60, 170, 180_}

@vspace{1ex}

2) In the table below, compute the  *measures of center* for this dataset.

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options='header']
|===
| Mean (Average) 	| Median 			| Mode(s)
| @ifsoln{_60_}		| @ifsoln{_40_}   	| @ifsoln{_45_}

|===

3) In the table below, compute the  *five number summary* of this dataset.

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options='header']
|===

| Minimum 			| Q1				| Q2 (Median) 		| Q3 				| Maximum

| @ifsoln{_10_}	  	| @ifsoln{_20_}  	| @ifsoln{_40_} 	| @ifsoln{_60_}  	| @ifsoln{_180_}

|===

4) On the number line below, draw a  *box plot* for this dataset.

@ifsoln{@centered-image{boxplot.png, "", 800}}

5) The following statements are _correct_ ... but misleading. Write down the reason why.

[cols="2a,5a"]

|===
| Statement | Why it’s misleading

| “They’re rich! The average person makes $60k dollars!”
| @ifsoln{_The mean is easily manipulated by a few outliers. For a dataset with this skew, median would have been a better measure._}

| “It’s a middle-income list: the most common salary is $45k/yr!”
| @ifsoln{___This is true, but mode should rarely be used for quantitative data with as much variability as this. The fact that $45k appears _twice_ doesn't tell us enough information about the shape for this claim to be useful.___}

| “This group is very low-income, the most common salary range is from $10k-$25k!”
| @ifsoln{_Two data points - especially the extremes! - should not be used to summarize a dataset._}
