= Shape of My Dataset

@vspace{1ex}

Find the measures of center and spread to summarize a column of your dataset. 

@vspace{1ex}

The column I chose to summarize is @fitb{45ex}{}.

@vspace{1ex}

== Measures of Center
--
The three measures of center for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)

| @span{.vskip}{} ||
|===
--

Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[higher/lower/about equal]} compared to the median, this suggests the shape is @fitbruby{60ex}{}{[skewed right (or high outliers) / skewed left (or low outliers) / symmetric]}.


== Measures of Spread
--
My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Q2 (Median) | Q3 | Maximum

| @span{.vskip}{} ||||

== Displaying Center and Spread with a Box Plot

Draw a box plot from this summary on the number line below. 

Be sure to label the number line with consistent intervals.
