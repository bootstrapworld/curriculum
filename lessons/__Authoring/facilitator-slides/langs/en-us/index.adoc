@description{Students develop a more nuanced interpretation of the Commutative and Associative Properties as a result of their exploration of the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction.}

== Order of Operations

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

I give my students a quiz with this problem:

@big{@math{1 + 1 \times 1 - 1}}

They all get it right.

Does this mean my students know the order of operations?

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

I give my students a new quiz!

@big{@math{-7 \times 5 \div \sqrt{9} + 18}}

All of my students get it wrong.

Does this mean that they *don't* know the order of operations?

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

If you assess the order of operations by giving kids arithmetic operations to solve, you are teaching them that *computation* is what the order of operations is all about.

Order of operations is not a computational skill, it's a literacy skill!


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

Chart Paper Activity

@big{@math{8 - (9 + 2 \times (4 - 1))}}

@big{@math{45 - 9 \times (3 + (2 - 4)) -7}}

@big{@math{\frac{20}{6 + 4} - \frac{5 \times 9}{-12 - 3}}}

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*An Extension for High School Teachers:*

@math{1 + 3}   ... versus ... @math{f(1, 3)}


The first option is what math looks like when kids are little.


The second option is what math looks like when kids get to algebra.

The first option has an operator, the second option has a function.

Conceptually, these are identical! But it's hard to get kids to see the connection between them. Circles of Evaluation make it obvious what the connection is.



== Simple Data Types

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

You discovered these rules, on your own! We didn't tell you. Your kids will too. The purpose of this worksheet is to scaffold the inquiry just enough for them to feel this out on their own. Rules that they discover on their own, they will remember a lot better than rules that we put on a visual at the front of the classroom.

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

We often don't think about what kind of values are reflected in the tools that we use. We *don't* want error messages to teach kids that mistakes are opportunities to be powerless.

That's why we spent a lot of time testing these error messages! We wanted to make sure that they are both readable but that they also use and teach vocabulary that is important for kids to learn.


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

This activity has a very specific intention. It is designed to let students practice (1) reading and interpreting error messages and (2) using driver/ navigator.

The section on numbers, strings, and Booleans can be done in a single class period. It is literally two worksheets that students do in small groups. But it is incredibly valuable.

You're teaching kids to read error messages and you're teaching them to be precise. Using driver/navigator helps to eliminate errors later.


== Contracts

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Contracts are a major pedagogical technique.*

Contracts are the second major pedagogical technique in Bootstrap. Circles of Evaluation are the first one, and contracts are the second.

Contracts are really important because just about every single mistake kids make can be solved by looking at their contracts. The answer is always, “Check your contract.”

And that is important, because it reminds students the value of writing stuff down.


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Contracts help students understand domain and range.*

Contracts give students a concrete understanding of a math concept that is pretty abstract.

When everything is a number, it's hard to understand domain and range. Kids wonder why they need to learn them, why they matter.

Domain and range is topic that we often squeeze in the week before finals. But once we have rich data types - like strings, Booleans, and images - domain and range become more concrete.


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Three Representations of a Function.*

We're building toward an understanding of three different representations for functions and we've already encountered the first one - contracts.

The goal is to get fluent in each representation. Eventually, we're going to talk about how each representation is essentially a tool you can use for solving word problems. If you know how to fit them together, you get a nice road map for attacking virtually any word problem you'll encounter.

== Function Composition

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

Function Composition is often considered a scaaaary skill.

If you realize that operators are functions (!), then kids have been doing function composition for a very long time.


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}


*Function Cards Activity Debrief*

What kinds of mathematical thinking did you find yourself engaging in?

There are MANY variations on this activity:

- A twist: Can you solve any of these with ONE function card?
- Give each group a BLANK card. Let groups discuss what function would be most helpful before they begin.
- Tell each group that they need to sacrifice one card. WHich one will it be?


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

Chart paper activity!

With your group, on a new piece of chart paper, draw a Circle of Evaluation showing how you played your cards / composed your functions to get from -22 to 13.





== Function Notation

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Diagramming Function Composition Worksheet Debrief*

What is the utility of this activity?

- Students visualize composing functions.
- They get to see two dimensions and not focus exclusively on going left to right.
- There are many ways to scaffold.
- Building conceptual (not procedural) understanding.


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Diagramming Function Composition Worksheet Debrief*

The circles give students something to fall back on if they need it.

Circles also allow us to ask some interesting questions - like, do @math{f(g(h(x)))} and @math{g(h(f(x)))} give you the same thing?

We can hold up the circles on the board and say, "draw the first one for me," - then, "draw the second one for me?" to discover if the structures are doing the same work or not.





== Transforming and Composing Images

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Rich Tasks*

In the math ed literature, there's a lot of research that has been done on what are called rich tasks. One of the hallmarks of a rich task in a math class is that it should be easy to check if you got the answer right... but it should *not* be easy to actually get the answer.

Flags are a great rich task because it's easy to see right away if an adjustment to the code was correct. If a student did something wrong, the flag doesn't look right!

Kids can instantly see if their ratios and proportions were correct... but actually knowing what will make them correct is not so simple.

== Solving Word Problems with the Design Recipe

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}


Connect to the Classroom: Using the Design Recipe to Help a Student

- Hey teacher! I'm trying to write these examples. I don't know what the function name is!
- Hey, Teacher! What do I have to give it? It's a number a string, right? Now, wait... two strings? I give it two strings?
- Teacher, I'm stuck again. I don't know what to put for "function produces!"
- I need to write my second example. Wait, I forgot the name of my function!
- I forgot how many inputs it takes. Help.
- Am I ready to define my function? Am I ready to move on? Or is there something I need to do before I move on?
- Wait, what should I name my variables?

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

Connect to the Classroom: Using the Design Recipe to Help a Student

It is natural to go a couple of steps forward and then realize that there was something missing and to go back and get it. It's important that students know that they can do that!

We are turning children into word problem compilers. They are seeing this big messy word problem. Each step in the recipe forces them to make it a little more formal.

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

Connect to the Classroom: The Design Recipe's Value

The takeaway here is that if a student has a good contract and purpose, they actually can't fail.

No matter how many questions they ask, we can say: check your contract, check your domain, check your range, look at your purpose statement, what did you circle?

This is cool because all they have to do is restate the problem and know what the domain and range are and everything else is just grunt work. All the thinking happens here; everything else is just formalizing that thinking!


@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

Connect to the Classroom: The Design Recipe's Value

Let's connect this back to the best practices in math that many of you probably already do.

- If you tell kids to show their work, you're already asking them to write examples.
- If you tell kids to start concrete and get abstract, or to connect multiple representations, then the Design Recipe should feel familiar.
- If you're spending time in your classroom having kids explain their thinking, that is time that can be spent working on the Design Recipe.
- Whatever time you're spending helping kids figure out where to start... you get all that time back. Because now they will always know where to begin – with the contract!

== Sam the Butterfly

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

Where have we seen this concept before? Sally's Lemonade!

In Sally's lemonade and Sam the butterfly, we asked you to solve the simple pieces first, and then we asked you to stitch them together.

But there's nothing that says we have to do the steps in this order. We could just have easily said, "I know Sam is onscreen as long as she's safe on the left and the right. What does it mean to be safe on the left? I'll deal with it later. What does it mean if Sam is safe on the right? I'll deal with it later."

@slidebreak{Math Title and Body}

I could also have said this: "Revenue minus cost... How do I compute revenue? I'll deal with it later. I don't want to compute the cost... I'll deal with it later.

These are two different strategies.

- One is top down: deal with the big picture and then solve the pieces.
- The other is bottom up: write the pieces and then figure out how to stitch them together.
