== Applying Functions - Reading Contracts

=== Overview
Students learn how to apply functions in @proglang, and are introduced to the notion of @vocab{Contracts}: a simple notation for keeping track of all possible input and output sets for a function.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}
In human languages, verbs _do things to nouns_. For example, I can "_throw_ a ball", or "_eat_ a sandwich". "Throw" and "Eat" are verbs, and "ball" and "sandwich" are nouns.

In programming languages, values are like nouns. You've learned about different data types in our programming language, like Number values (`42`, `-8.3`, etc), String values (`"hello!"`), and Boolean values (`true` and `false`). @ifproglang{pyret}{We already know _some_ verbs, like `+`, and `-` ... each of which _does something_ to Number values.}

@scrub{IN A SELF-GUIDED VERSION OF THIS LESSON, I'D WANT TO HAVE STUDENTS INTERACT WITH THE TWO PARAGRAPHS ABOVE.}

@slidebreak{Launch}

In programming, most verbs are called @vocab{functions}. A function is like a machine at a factory:

1. It takes in some values (called @vocab{arguments})

2. It _does something_ to those values

3. It produces a new value

@slidebreak{Launch-DN}
@editorconfig{{definitionsAtLastRun: 'use context starter2024' }}

Let's play with a function to get the hang of it. 

@ifselfguided{<input type="button" value="Click here" onclick='addToEditor(\`
string-length("rainbow")
\`, 0)' /> to add @show{(code '(string-length "rainbow"))} to the editor.}

@lesson-instruction{
@ifnotselfguided{
- Log into @starter-file{editor} and click "Run".
- Then type @show{(code '(string-length "rainbow"))} into the Interactions Area and hit Enter.
}
- What do you think the `string-length` function does? Come up with a theory and test it out by using the function with other inputs.
}

Be sure to read any error messages you get back carefully! They might have clues to help you understand what's going on.

@slidebreak{Launch}

@scrub{ES - I WOULD EXPECT QANDA TO BECOME MDQuiz FIELDS}

@QandA{
@Q{What does the expression @show{(code '(string-length "rainbow"))} evaluate to?}
@A{7}

@Q{What does the function `string-length` do?}
@A{It counts the number of characters in a string and returns the value.}

@Q{How many arguments does `string-length` expect? How do you know?}
@A{One. Giving it more than one produces an error.}

@Q{What type of argument does the function expect? How do you know?}
@A{String. Giving it a different type of data produces an error.}

@Q{What type of data did `string-length` produce?}
@A{Number}
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
@strategy{Connecting to Function Notation}{

If your students are already familiar with function notation, Pyret mirrors it precisely, so this is a terrific opportunity to make the connection!

_If your students are not yet familiar with function notation, no need to introduce it now... it will make more sense to introduce once they are fluent in how Pyret works, and we have an entire @lesson-link{function-notation} lesson devoted to making the connection._

@slidebreak{Investigate}
The expressions using the `regular-polygon` function produced a value that wasn't a Number, a String, or a Boolean. In the @proglang programming language, these values are called _Images_.

@QandA{
@Q{What are the three parts of a contract?}
@A{*Name* -- the name of the function, which we type in whenever we want to use it}
@A{*Domain* -- the type(s) of data we give to the function}
@A{*Range* -- the type of data the function produces}

@Q{Why is it helpful to know the *Name* of a function?}
@A{The Name tells us what to write/type, to start using the function}

@Q{Why is it helpful to know the *Domain* of a function?}
@A{The Domain tells us _how many_ arguments the function needs, what data type each one has to be, and in what order.}

@Q{Why is it helpful to know the *Range* of a function?}
@A{The Range tells us what we should expect to _get back_ from a function.}

@Q{Where else have you heard the word "contract" used in the real world? How can you connect that meaning to contracts in programming?}
@A{_Answers will vary!_}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@ifnotselfguided{
Contracts are _binding_ agreements! For example, we might sign a contract with a plumber to install a sink for $200. As long as they install the sink, we are obligated to pay them $200. If a parent promises to order pizza if their child does their chores, they'd better order that pizza if the child does those chores!

If one party breaks the contract, bad things can happen.} @scrub{DORAI- I WANT TO END THE @IFNOTSELFGUIDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LINE AND MAKE IT VISIBLE TO AUTHORS IN THE FILE WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE LINE ON THE HTML VERSION} In some programming languages, breaking a function's contract can cause the whole computer to crash, or it can result in a security hole that lets the program be hacked! In @proglang, the contracts are checked every time we use a function, so the result of a contract error is a helpful error message.

@lesson-point{
A Contract is an agreement between us and a function: if it gets what it expects, it'll give us what we expect.
}

@slidebreak{Synthesize}

- How would you explain Domain and Range to someone who missed today's class?
- What questions do you have about Contracts?

@pd-slide{
*Connect to the Classroom: Contracts are a major pedagogical technique.*

Contracts are the second major pedagogical technique in Bootstrap. Circles of Evaluation are the first one, and contracts are the second.

Contracts are really important because just about every single mistake kids make can be solved by looking at their contracts. The answer is always, “Check your contract.”

And that is important, because it reminds students the value of writing stuff down.
}

== Composing with Circles of Evaluation

=== Overview

Students learn to work with more than one function at once, by way of Circles of Evaluation, a visual representation of the underlying structure.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}
@editorconfig{{
    definitionsAtLastRun: 'use context starter2024'
  }}

What if we wanted to see your name written on a diagonal?

- We know that we can use the `text` function to make an Image of your name.

@hspace{2em} @show{(contract 'text '((message String) (size Number) (color String)) "Image")}

-  @proglang also has a function called `rotate` that will rotate any Image a specified number of degrees.

@hspace{2em} @show{(contract 'rotate '(Number Image) "Image")}

_But how could the `rotate` and `text` functions work together?_

@scrub{@ifselfguided{WE WANT AN EMPTY FIELD FOR THEM TO WRITE IN HERE.}}


=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}
@scrub{DORAI how do I use @imageconfig{} here to tell it to show the COE described below on the right?}

One way to organize our thoughts is to diagram what we want to do, using the Circles of Evaluation. Circles of Evaluation @ifnotselfguided{help us think about what we want to do, without worrying about syntax like quotation marks, parentheses, etc. They} let us use all our brains for _thinking_, before we use them for _coding_.

The rules are simple:

(1) Every Circle of Evaluation must have one - and only one! - function, written at the top.

(2) The arguments of the function are written left-to-right, in the middle of the Circle.

 * Values like Numbers, Strings, and Booleans are still written by themselves. It’s only when we want to _use a function_ that we need to draw a nested Circle.

(3) Circles can contain other Circles!

}

To convert a Circle of Evaluation into code, we start at the outside and work our way in. After each function, we write a pair of parentheses, and then convert each argument inside the Circle.

== Functions for Tables @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Building on their understanding of @lesson-link{contracts-strings-images, Contracts}, students will be introduced to functions for working with _tables_, including: @show{(code 'sort)},  @show{(code 'count)}, @show{(code 'first-n-rows)} and @show{(code 'row-n)}.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch-DN}
@scrub{DORAI - we want the `@editor-config{}` to open the animals starter file here.}

@ifselfguided{
<input type="button" value="Click here" onclick='addToEditor(\`animals-table\`)' /> to load the `animals-table`!
}

@QandA{
@ifnotselfguided{
- Open the @starter-file{animals} and click "Run".
- In the Interactions Window on the right type `animals-table` and hit "Enter" to see the the table.
}
@Q{What do you Notice?}
@A{Sample response: We only see the first 10 rows of the table and would have to click to see the remaining 22 rows.}
@A{The animals aren't listed in any particular order.}

@Q{What do you Wonder?}
@A{Sample response: Is it possible to alphabetize the list, or sort it in other ways?}
}

@teacher{If this is the first time your students are seeing a table in @starter-file{editor}, you may also want to acknowledge lines 7-10 of the Definitions Area, where `animals-table` is defined along with the names of the 8 columns.}


=== Investigate

}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
@Q{What did these `sort` expressions do?}
@A{They took in the `animals-table`, the `name` column, and true or false... producing a new table, sorted alphabetically +
@hspace{1em}(A-Z for `true` and Z-A for `false`)
}

@Q{What does it mean that the Range of `sort` is Table?}
@A{The function produces a new table.}

@Q{Type `animals-table` and hit "Enter". Did sorting our animals change the value of the table?}
@A{No. It made a new one.}
}

@slideonlybreak{Investigate}

@ifnotselfguided{
Let's review what we know about Contracts. Every Contract has three parts:

1. *Name* -- the name of the function, which we type in whenever we want to use it
2. *Domain* -- the type(s) of data we give to the function
3. *Range* -- the type of data the function produces

@lesson-point{
Contracts are the _instruction manual_ for functions.
}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}
@scrub{DORAI - we want the `@editor-config{}` to open the animals starter file here.}

Let's explore the Contract for another function that works with Tables: `count`

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the second section of @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables.adoc}: *Summarizing a Column with `count`*.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}
@scrub{I'm not sure WHAT CONFIG we want - ES - should we ever just have a book page?}

@QandA{
@Q{How did the `count` function summarize a column?}
@A{It made a new table, with rows for all the unique values in that column and a count of how many times each value appeared.}

@Q{Is the summary produced by the `count` function useful when summarizing the `pounds` column? Why or why not?}
@A{Since almost every animal has a unique weight, the summary is almost as long as the original table!}
}

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@scrub{DORAI - Does it really make sense for us to write @imageconfig{images/freqency-table.png} here? Or should the image also be implicit from the lesson plan?}

@right{@image{images/frequency-table.png, 110}}The `count` function produces a @vocab{frequency table}, which summarizes the data by showing how often - how _frequently_ - specific values appear in a dataset.

@vocab{Frequency tables} are a commonly used tool in statistics because they give us a quick sense of the distribution and can help us to identify patterns.

@slidebreak{Investigate}
@scrub{DORAI - we want the `@editor-config{}` to open the animals starter file here.}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the first two sections of @printable-exercise{functions-for-tables-cont.adoc} to explore some new table functions: `row-n` and `first-n-rows`.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}
@scrub{DORAI - we want the `@editor-config{}` to open the animals starter file here.}

The second input to `row-n` is a Number, called the _index_ of the Row. The index tells Pyret how many data Rows to count from the first one in the table.

If we want the _second_ Row in the table, Pyret needs to count one Row down from the beginning of the table. That's why the index for the second Row is `1`.

@QandA{
@Q{What index number do we need to give `row-n` for Pyret to return the first row of the Table?}
@A{0. Because Pyret is already at the beginning of the table and doesn't need to count down any rows!}

@Q{What is the index of the _fifth_ Row in the table?}
@A{The index of the fifth row is `4`}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}
@scrub{DORAI - we want the `@editor-config{}` to open the animals starter file here.}

@lesson-instruction{

}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

Sometimes we have a value that we want to use again and again, and it makes sense to define a name for it. Every definition includes a _name_ and a _value_. In the code below, we have definitions for a String, a Number, an Image and a Row.

```
name = "Denny"
age = 16
logo = star(50, "solid", "red")
pet = row-n(animals-table, 3)
```

@QandA{
@Q{What are the names given in each of these definitions?}
@A{name, age, logo and pet}
@Q{What are the values given to each of these names?}
@A{The String "Denny", the Number 16, an Image of a solid red star, and the 4th Row of the Animals Table.}
@Q{Take a moment to look at the first challenge problem and think. How you would describe the table that `first-n-rows` is taking in?}
@A{It's taking in a table of the animals that has been sorted from lightest to heaviest.}
}


=== Common Misconceptions

Students are likely to think that `sort` _changes the table_, when instead it _produces a new, sorted table._ Encourage students to say out loud what they think they will get if they type `animals-table` after evaluating @show{(code '(sort animals-table "name" true))}. By testing their hypothesis, students who are surprised at the outcome are much more likely to remember the difference later on.

Students often struggle to remember that Row indices start at _zero!_ You'll want to practice this a few times.

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

@QandA{
@Q{How is the function of `count` different from `sort`?}
@A{`sort` made a new table that was reordered.}
@A{`count` made a new table that summarized the data from a column of the original table!}

@Q{How does the function `first-n-rows` work?}
@A{It makes a new smaller table with the number of rows you type into the expression.}

@Q{What is important to remember when using the `row-n` function?}
@A{We need to give the function a number that is one less than the row we want.}

@Q{Do you have any questions about the functions or expressions you've worked with today?}

@Q{Where have you seen tables summarizing counts in the real world?}

@Q{How else do journalists and newscasters visualize summaries of data besides in tables?}
@A{Ideally someone will say bar charts!}

== Functions for Making Data Visualizations @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students will be introduced to functions for making one-variable visualizations in Pyret, including: @show{(code 'pie-chart)}, @show{(code 'bar-chart)}, @show{(code 'box-plot)} and @show{(code 'histogram)}.

The goal here is for students to become familiar with using @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts} to write expressions that will produce visualizations. But knowing how to __make__ a histogram doesn't mean a student really __understands__ histograms, and that's OK!

@teacher{Once students know how to use Contracts to write expressions to make these visualizations, we have dedicated, in-depth lessons focused on understanding @lesson-link{bar-and-pie-charts}, @lesson-link{histograms-visualize}, @lesson-link{histograms-interpret}, @lesson-link{box-plots}, @lesson-link{scatter-plots}, @lesson-link{linear-regression}, @lesson-link{advanced-visualizations}, etc.}
