== Introduction to Data Science

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom*

This is an activity that does not require any math or programming!

We do this activity with kids. When we do this with students, we ask them questions that matter to them.

Believe it or not, this activity actually does run very similarly with actual children. As long as you choose your questions well, kids will be passionate and there will be controversy.

*Connect to the Classroom*

This is an activity that a lot of our teachers rinse and repeat - maybe once a semester, once a quarter, or once per month. And what they find is that as students move through the material, the richness of discussion increases. In their groups, students start to cut right to the chase:

- "Oh, we should look for confounding variables."
- "Ooh, we should look for kids not just in the sample, but outside of the sample."



== Simple Data Types

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}


@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

You discovered these rules, on your own! We didn't tell you. Your kids will too. The purpose of this worksheet is to scaffold the inquiry just enough for them to feel this out on their own. Rules that they discover on their own, they will remember a lot better than rules that we put on a visual at the front of the classroom.

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

We often don't think about what kind of values are reflected in the tools that we use. We *don't* want error messages to teach kids that mistakes are opportunities to be powerless.

That's why we spent a lot of time testing these error messages! We wanted to make sure that they are both readable but that they also use and teach vocabulary that is important for kids to learn.


@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

This activity has a very specific intention. It is designed to let students practice (1) reading and interpreting error messages and (2) using driver/ navigator.

The section on numbers, strings, and Booleans can be done in a single class period. It is literally two worksheets that students do in small groups. But it is incredibly valuable.

You're teaching kids to read error messages and you're teaching them to be precise. Using driver/navigator helps to eliminate errors later.


== Contracts: Making Tables and Displays

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Contracts are a major pedagogical technique.*

Contracts are the second major pedagogical technique in Bootstrap. Circles of Evaluation are the first one, and contracts are the second.

Contracts are really important because just about every single mistake kids make can be solved by looking at their contracts. The answer is always, “Check your contract.”

And that is important, because it reminds students the value of writing stuff down.


@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Contracts help students understand domain and range.*

Contracts give students a concrete understanding of a math concept that is pretty abstract.

When everything is a number, it's hard to understand domain and range. Kids wonder why they need to learn them, why they matter.

Domain and range is topic that we often squeeze in the week before finals. But once we have rich data types - like strings, Booleans, and images - domain and range become more concrete.


@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Three Representations of a Function.*

We're building toward an understanding of three different representations for functions and we've already encountered the first one - contracts.

The goal is to get fluent in each representation. Eventually, we're going to talk about how each representation is essentially a tool you can use for solving word problems. If you know how to fit them together, you get a nice road map for attacking virtually any word problem you'll encounter.

== Solving Word Problems with the Design Recipe

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}


*Connect to the Classroom: Using the Design Recipe to Help a Student*

- Hey teacher! I'm trying to write these examples. I don't know what the function name is!
- Hey, Teacher! What do I have to give it? It's a number a string, right? Now, wait... two strings? I give it two strings?
- Teacher, I'm stuck again. I don't know what to put for "function produces!"
- I need to write my second example. Wait, I forgot the name of my function!
- I forgot how many inputs it takes. Help.
- Am I ready to define my function? Am I ready to move on? Or is there something I need to do before I move on?
- Wait, what should I name my variables?

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: Using the Design Recipe to Help a Student*

It is natural to go a couple of steps forward and then realize that there was something missing and to go back and get it. It's important that students know that they can do that!

We are turning children into word problem compilers. They are seeing this big messy word problem. Each step in the recipe forces them to make it a little more formal.

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: The Design Recipe's Value*

The takeaway here is that if a student has a good contract and purpose, they actually can't fail.

No matter how many questions they ask, we can say: check your contract, check your domain, check your range, look at your purpose statement, what did you circle?

This is cool because all they have to do is restate the problem and know what the domain and range are and everything else is just grunt work. All the thinking happens here; everything else is just formalizing that thinking!


@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Connect to the Classroom: The Design Recipe's Value*

Let's connect this back to the best practices in math that many of you probably already do.

- If you tell kids to show their work, you're already asking them to write examples.
- If you tell kids to start concrete and get abstract, or to connect multiple representations, then the Design Recipe should feel familiar.
- If you're spending time in your classroom having kids explain their thinking, that is time that can be spent working on the Design Recipe.
- Whatever time you're spending helping kids figure out where to start... you get all that time back. Because now they will always know where to begin – with the contract!


== Row and Column Lookups

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

Tables have tons of data - of all different types! - arranged into Rows and Columns. They feel like a monolith.

With lookups, we've given kids surgical precision to hone in on _an individual row_, and to hone in on an _individual value_ from that row. That might be kind of important if we want to do something like... *filter a table* showing only the individual rows where species equals dog.

Now we can use definitions to make our lives easier! If we find that we're writing the same thing over and over and over, we could just define `cat-row` instead of needing to retype all the lookup code every time.

== Histograms

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

Shape is Critical!

The axes are not labeled intentionally! We want you to get good  at identifying shape without leaning on numbers, because numbers can be very misleading in statistics.

K-12 mathematics doesn't talk about shape enough... and when we do talk about shape, we often give kids the idea that all datasets should have a normal distribution - a hump in the middle of a bell curve.



== Visualizing the Shape of the Data

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Chart Paper Activity: What Shape Makes Sense?*

Around the room, there are several blank pieces of chart paper. Each piece of chart paper has one of three possible titles: Symmetric, Skew Left, and Skew Right.

I will group you into teams of 2-3 teachers, and assign each team a blank poster.

Your team must: (1) draw a histogram of the specified shape, (2) brainstorm a sample that will likely result in that distribution.

Once all teams have completed the task, teams will rotate to the next poster and brainstorm another sample.

== Measures of Center

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}


A lot of math books talk about mean, median, and mode before they talk about box plots or histograms. At Bootstrap, we believe that is a mistake.

_Kids need to see the shape of the data first_, otherwise mean, median and mode are just formulas to memorize.

Looking at the shape of the data puts ground under your feet. Otherwise, you're too focused on numbers, and measures of center don't actually mean anything.

== Box Plots

@slidebreak{Core Title Slide}

@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}

*Matching Debrief: Think about shape, don't rely on numbers!*

There are teachers and students who complain about this page. They say that this page is unfair because we didn't label the axes. The stats teachers are always shocked at their colleagues. They say, "It doesn't matter! We're talking about shape. Skew right is skew right, no matter where it falls on the x axis.""

So many kids have sort of a statistical lazy eye. How do you fix that? You wear a patch over the strong eye. By removing the numbers, it forces people to think about the shape. If the numbers are there, you get high achieving algebra students who never learn shape because they keep using the numbers.


@slidebreak{DS Title and Body}


*Chart Paper Activity (Continued): What Shape Makes Sense?*

We've already added histograms to our chart papers around the room.

This time, we are going to complete another round of the same activity, but your group will (1) add a *box plot* of the specified shape, (2) brainstorm a sample that will result in the given distribution.

Once all teams have completed the task, teams will rotate to the next poster and brainstorm another sample.
