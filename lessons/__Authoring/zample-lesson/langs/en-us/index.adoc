== The Additive Inverse Property @duration{10 minutes}

=== Investigate

Taking the first two pairs of values in the the last table on @printable-exercise{slope-int-tables-intro.adoc, the page}, gives us:

@indented{@math{{56 - 5}\over{20 - 3}}}
@indented{We can simplify that to @math{{51}\over{17}}, for a slope of @math{3}.}

We would get the same answer for this example if we subtracted the coordinates in the opposite order...

@indented{@math{{5 - 56} \over {3 - 20}} = @math{{-51} \over {-17}} = 3}

But if we mixed subtracted the x values in a different order than we subtracted the y-values, we'd get the wrong answer!

@indented{@math{{56 - 5} \over {3 - 20}} = @math{{51} \over {-17}} = -3}

@QandA{
@Q{What _hint_ does the error message give us about how to use this function?}
@A{image{images/sort-error.png, 650}}
@A{The the sort function expects 3 arguments and its Domain is Table, String, Boolean. If we don't give it those three things we'll get an error instead of the sorted table we want.}

- What would the next pair be for each of these tables?
- What would the y-values be when x is 0?
}

@slidebreak

- At each point in our linear model, @math{y} is the _predicted median lifespan_, and @math{x} is the _log of per-capita gdp_.

- We want @math{x} to represent the **original, un-transformed** value, simply using _per-capita gdp_ as-is...

- We've learned that:

** the *slope* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *log coefficient* in the un-transformed logarithmic model

** the *vertical shift* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *vertical shift* in the un-transformed logarithmic model

=== Synthesize

- Using @proglang allows us to evaluate arithmetic expressions easily and efficiently. In your own words, describe _how_ you tested the equivalence of different expression - and how you interpreted the results that @proglang produced.
- In @proglang, what does it mean for a test to pass? What does it mean for a test to fail?
- What did this programming exploration teach you about the additive inverse?
