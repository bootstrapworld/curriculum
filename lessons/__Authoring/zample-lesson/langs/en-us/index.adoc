= The Additive Inverse Property

@description{Students develop a more nuanced interpretation of the Commutative and Associative Properties as a result of their exploration of the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction.}

=== Investigate

For the remainder of the activity, we will examine examples blocks. The first one includes only examples that pass. The second one has some errors! And the third one includes just one examples... *you* will be responsible for providing additional examples!


@teacher{
@opt{If you would like to offer students additional practice with the additive inverse in @proglang, two optional activities include opt-printable-exercise{are-they-identical.adoc} and opt-printable-exercise{writing-equivalent-code-additive.adoc}.}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- We know that all functions will need an open parentheses and at least one input!
- We don't know the Domain, so we don't know how many inputs or what types they are. But we can always guess, and if we get it wrong we'll use the error message as a clue.
- Type @show{(code '(sort animals-table))} in the Interactions Area and read the error message.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What _hint_ does the error message give us about how to use this function?}
@A{image{images/sort-error.png, 650}}
@A{The the sort function expects 3 arguments and its Domain is Table, String, Boolean. If we don't give it those three things we'll get an error instead of the sorted table we want.}
}

@slidebreak

@indented{
If we wanted to get extra fancy and see the species count for the youngest ten animals, we could add another layer to our Circle of Evaluation.

@do{
(define exp2 '(count (first-n-rows (sort animals-table "age" true) 10) "species"))
}

@show{(coe exp2)}
}

__Note: Values like Numbers, Strings, and Booleans are still written by themselves. Itâ€™s only when we want to use a function that we need to draw a Circle.__

=== Synthesize

- Using @proglang allows us to evaluate arithmetic expressions easily and efficiently. In your own words, describe _how_ you tested the equivalence of different expression - and how you interpreted the results that @proglang produced.
- In @proglang, what does it mean for a test to pass? What does it mean for a test to fail?
- What did this programming exploration teach you about the additive inverse?
