@slidebreak

It depends! We can either work

- outside in: @show{(coe '(- 10 ((?ANS +) (?ANS 5) (?ANS 3))))}
- or inside out: @show{(coe '((?ANS -) (?ANS 10) (+ 5 3)))}

@teacher{The Circle of Evaluation for xys  is shown on the next slide.}

@slidebreak

Either way, we'll end up with @show{(coe '(- 10 (+ 5 3)))}

@teacher{
If it works for you, use this set of cards to have students physically match expressions and Circles of Evaluations.
