For the remainder of the activity, we will examine examples blocks. The first one includes only examples that pass. The second one has some errors! And the third one includes just one examples... *you* will be responsible for providing additional examples! show{(coe '(+ 9 2))}

@slidebreak

- At each point in our linear model, @math{y} is the _predicted median lifespan_, and @math{x} is the _log of per-capita gdp_.

- We want @math{x} to represent the **original, un-transformed** value, simply using _per-capita gdp_ as-is...

- We've learned that:

** the *slope* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *log coefficient* in the un-transformed logarithmic model

** the *vertical shift* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *vertical shift* in the un-transformed logarithmic model

=== Synthesize

- Using @proglang allows us to evaluate arithmetic expressions easily and efficiently. In your own words, describe _how_ you tested the equivalence of different expression - and how you interpreted the results that @proglang produced.
- In @proglang, what does it mean for a test to pass? What does it mean for a test to fail?
- What did this programming exploration teach you about the additive inverse?
