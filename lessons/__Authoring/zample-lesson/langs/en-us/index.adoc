@math{{56 - 5}\over{20 - 3}}}

@ifnotslide{
@QandA{
@Q{Let's draw the Circle of Evaluation for the expression @math{10 - (5 + 3)}}
@Q{What should we do first?}
@A{It depends! We can either work

- outside in: @show{(coe '(- 10 ((?ANS +) (?ANS 5) (?ANS 3))))}
- or inside out: @show{(coe '((?ANS -) (?ANS 10) (+ 5 3)))}
}
}
}

@ifslide{
Let's draw the Circle of Evaluation for the expression @math{10 - (5 + 3)}.
What should we do first?

@teacher{Options are shown on the next slide.}

@ifslide{
It depends! We can either work

- outside in: @show{(coe '(- 10 ((?ANS +) (?ANS 5) (?ANS 3))))}
- or inside out: @show{(coe '((?ANS -) (?ANS 10) (+ 5 3)))}

@teacher{The Circle of Evaluation for @math{10 - (5 + 3)} is shown on the next slide.}

@slidebreak

Either way, we'll end up with @show{(coe '(- 10 (+ 5 3)))}

@opt{If it works for you, use @handout{pages/cards-for-matching-coe-exp.adoc, this set of cards} to have students physically match expressions and Circles of Evaluations.}
