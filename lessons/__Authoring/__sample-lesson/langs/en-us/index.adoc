- Decide how much choice you're ready to offer your students before you begin. Research shows that choice increases student engagement! But focusing the whole class on a single dataset is also an option.
  * Would focusing your students on a single dataset make this doable for you? Because you teach younger students who might need more scaffolding? Or because you are new to teaching data science and managing fewer moving parts would increase your confidence? @ifproglang{pyret}{We recommend focusing on @opt-starter-file{food}.}

| Key Points for the Facilitator

@objective{expressions-exponents}
@objective{develop-statistical-question}
Each section should declare its objectives. These will automatically be compiled in the order they appear in lesson plan the materials table. The objectives get defined in various files found in the `shared/langs/en-us/learningObjectives`. 

Norms we have agreed upon for these objectives include the following:
- learning objective is the right size for us to imagine the assessment that would let us know that a student has met the objective
- learning objective should stand on its own if taken out of the context of the lesson plan
- Always capitalize the first letter
- Always end with a period
- Explain, Understand, Define, describe how __ works together", should explicitly include the enduring understanding we expect students to articulate.
- Never use "Animals Dataset" or "their chosen dataset" in Learning Objective
- Bootstrap-specific terminology should be used only when necessary
- Add "in ATifproglang{}" to objectives about visualizations
- Dependent clauses should go at the end
- bold "and" when it's critical for all components to be used a
- "or" should be used when any of the modalities would meet the objective
- "Diagram with Circles of Evaluation" not Model with

@Q{Do you think age is the only factor that determines how long it takes for an animal to get adopted?}
@A{The goal here is to have an open discussion and draw students in. Allow students to share their opinions freely. For example: 
*** No! People like animals that are cute and friendly. 
*** Some dog breeds are probably more popular than others. 
*** Animals that are healthy might get adopted faster.
