= Threats to Validity

Data scientists want to know if listening to music or podcasts
reduce symptoms of stress in individuals. They conducted *a study
of 1,000 people who were brought into a laboratory office for
testing*. While wearing a heart-rate monitor, participants were
asked to listen to either music or a podcast of their choosing
while completing a series of complicated puzzles. The data
scientists discovered that on average, *participants who listened
to music had a 5% lower heart rate while completing the tasks
than those who listened topodcasts*.

Before publishing their
findings, the data scientists have asked you to review their
claim. In the space below, indicate possible threats to
validity faced by this study.
