_The animal shelter wanted to find out what kind of food to buy for their animals. They took a random sample of two animals and the food they eat, and they found that spider and rabbit food was by far the most popular cuisine!_

What are some possible threats to the validity of this conclusion?

@span{.blankline}{There may have been a sampling bias - perhaps the person who collected the data happens to love spiders and rabbits!}

@span{.blankline}{The sample size is too small to be representative.}

_A volunteer opens the shelter in the morning and walks all the dogs. At mid-day, another volunteer feeds all the dogs and walks them again. In the evening, a third volunteer walks the dogs a final time and closes the shelter. The volunteers report that the dogs are much friendlier and more active at mid-day, so the shelter staff assume the second volunteer must be better with animals than the others._

What are some possible threats to the validity of this conclusion?

@span{.blankline}{There may be several confounding variables here. Perhaps the volunteer is carrying bacon in their pocket!}

@span{.blankline}{Or perhaps dogs are in better moods in the middle of the day, when the sun is out}
