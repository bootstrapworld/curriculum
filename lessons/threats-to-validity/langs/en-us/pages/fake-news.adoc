There are six separate, _unrelated_ claims below, and ALL OF THEM ARE WRONG! Your job is to figure out why by looking at the data.

| What's Wrong

| @n
| The average player on a basketball team is 6′1″.
| _“Most of the players are taller than 6′.”_
| @ifsoln{ Average (mean) is highly sensitive to outliers. Most players could be under 6 feet tall, with one 6-foot-10 player throwing off the mean. }

| @n
| Linear regression found a positive correlation (r=0.42) between people’s height and salary.
| _“Taller people are more qualified for their jobs.”_
| @ifsoln{ Correlation is not causation, and - more importantly - there may be _biases_ at work relating height to salary which have nothing to do with how qualified a person is! }

| @n
| @centered-image{fake-news-3.png, Fake news 3}
| _“According to the predictor function indicated here, the value on the x-axis will predict the value on the y-axis 63.6% of the time.”_
| @ifsoln{R-Values tell us how much of the _variability_ in the response is explained by the predictor, *not how accurate it is!*}


| @n
| @centered-image{fake-news-4.png, "Bar Chart of Pet Ages", 400}
| _“According to this bar chart, Felix makes up a little more than 15% of the total ages of all the animals in the dataset.”_
| @ifsoln{Felix is _15 years old_.}

| @n
| @centered-image{fake-news-5.png, Fake news 5}
| _“According to this histogram, most animals weigh between 40 and 60 pounds.”_
| @ifsoln{Incorrect. The 40-60 pound bin has more animals than any other bin, but it makes up only a small fraction of the whole.}

| @n
| Linear regression found a negative correlation (r= -0.91) between the number of hairs on a person’s head and their likelihood of owning a wig.
| _“Owning wigs causes people to go bald.”_
| @ifsoln{Correlation is not causation!}
