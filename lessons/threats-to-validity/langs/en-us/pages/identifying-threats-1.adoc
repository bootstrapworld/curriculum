Data scientists surveyed *100 coffee and tea drinkers over a 1-month period* to determine a connection between caffeine consumption and sleep disorders. Respondents were asked questions regarding the *amount of coffee or tea consumed daily, dietary habits, sleep habits, and exercise levels*. Based on this survey, the data scientists claim that  *people who drink tea exclusively have moreincidents of insomnia than people who drank coffee exclusively*.
