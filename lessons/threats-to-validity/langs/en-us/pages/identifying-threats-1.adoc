Respondents were asked questions regarding the *amount of coffee or tea consumed daily, dietary habits, sleep habits, and exercise levels*. Based on this survey, the data scientists claim that *people who drink tea exclusively have moreincidents of insomnia than people who drank coffee exclusively*.
