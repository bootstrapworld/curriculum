We can *define our own functions*, using a technique called the  *Design Recipe*.

-  We use the Design Recipe to help us define functions  *and think through problems clearly*.

- The first step is to write a *Contract* and *Purpose Statement* for the function, which specify the Name, Domain and Range of the function and give a summary of what it does.

- The second step is to *write at least two examples*, which show how the function should work for specific inputs. These examples help us see patterns, and we express those patterns by *circling and labeling* what changes.

- The final step is to *define the function*, which generalizes our examples.
