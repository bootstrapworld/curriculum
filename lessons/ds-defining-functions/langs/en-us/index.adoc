== Defining Functions over Numbers @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
In the first lesson, students learned to define _values_ (e.g. - `name = "Maya"`). Students should have defined `animalA` and `animalB` to be two different rows in the animals table. If they haven't, make sure they do this now.

=== Launch
Suppose we want to make a solid, green triangle of size 10. What would we type? What if we wanted to make one of size 20? 25? 1000?
----
triangle(10, "solid", "green")
triangle(20, "solid", "green")
triangle(25, "solid", "green")
triangle(1000, "solid", "green")
----

This is a lot of redundant typing, when the only thing changing is the size of the triangle! It would be convenient to define a _shortcut_, which only needs the size. Suppose we call it `gt` for short:
----
gt(10)
gt(20)
gt(25)
gt(1000)
----

We don't need to tell `gt` whether the shape is `"solid"` or `"outline"`, and we don't need to tell it what color to use. We will define our shortcut so it already knows these things, and all it needs is the size. This is a lot like defining values, which we already know how to do. But values don't change, so our triangles would always be the same size. Instead of defining values, we need to define _functions_.

To build our own functions, we’ll use a series of steps called the @vocab{Design Recipe}. The Design Recipe is a way to think through the behavior of a function, to make sure we don’t make any mistakes with the animals that depend on us! The Design Recipe has three steps, and we’ll go through them together for our first function.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @workbook-link{pages/design-recipe-1.adoc} in your Student Workbook, and read the word problem at the top of the page.

[.lesson-point]
Step 1: Contract and Purpose

The first thing we do is write a Contract for this function. You already know a lot about contracts: they tell us the Name, Domain and Range of the function. Our function is named `gt`, and it consumes a Number. It makes triangles, so the output will be an Image. A Purpose Statement is just a description of what the function does:

----
# gt :: (size :: Number) -> Image
# Consumes a size, and produces a solid green triangle of that size.
----

Since the contract and purpose statement are notes for humans, we add the # symbol at the front of the line to turn them into comments.

Be sure to check students’ contracts and purpose statements before having them move on!

[.lesson-point]
Step 2: Write Examples

Examples are a way for us to tell the computer how our function should behave for a specific input. We can write as many examples as we want, but they must all be wrapped in an examples: block and an end statement. Examples start with the name of the function we’re writing, followed by an example input. Suppose we write `gt(10)`. What work do we have to do, in order to produce the right shape as a result? What if we write `gt(20)`?

----
# gt :: (size :: Number) -> Image
# Consumes a size, and produces a solid green triangle of that size.
examples:
  gt(10) is triangle(10, "solid", "green")
  gt(10) is triangle(10, "solid", "green")
end
----

[.lesson-point]
Step 3: Define the Function

We start with the `fun` keyword (short for “function”), followed by the name of our function and a set of parentheses. This is exactly how all of our examples started, too. But instead of writing `10` or `20`, we’ll use the label from our Domain. Then we add a colon (`:`) in place of `is`, and write out the work we did to get the answers for our examples. Finally, we finish with the `end` keyword.

----
# gt :: (size :: Number) -> Image
# Consumes a size, and produces a solid green triangle of that size.
examples:
  gt(10) is triangle(10, "solid", "green")
  gt(10) is triangle(10, "solid", "green")
end
fun gt(size):
  triangle(size, "solid", "green")
end
----

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Type your function definition into the Definitions Area. Be sure to include the Contract, Purpose Statement, Examples _and_ your Definition! Once you have typed everything in, click "Run" and evaluate `gt(10)` in the Interactions Area. What did you get back?

Once we have defined a function, we can use it as our shortcut! This makes it easy to write simpler code, by moving the complexity into a function that can be tested and re-used whenever we like.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Use the Design Recipe to solve the word problem at the bottom of @workbook-link{pages/design-recipe-1.adoc}.
* Type in the Contract, Purpose Statement, Examples and Definition into the Definitions Area.
* Click “Run”, and make sure all your examples pass!
* Type bc(20) into the Interactions Area. What happens?

=== Synthesize
Ask students what happens if they change one of the examples to be incorrect:
  gt(10) is triangle(99, "solid", "green")


== Defining Functions over Other Datatypes @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students deepen their understanding of function definition and the Design Recipe, by solving different kinds of problems.

=== Launch
Functions can consume values besides Numbers. For example, we might want to define a function called `sticker` that consumes a _Color_, and draws a star of that color:
----
sticker("blue") is star(50, "solid", "blue")
sticker("yellow") is star(50, "solid", "yellow")
----

Or a function called `nametag` that consumes a _Row_ from the animals table, and draws that animal's name in purple letters.
----
nametag(animalA) is text(animalA["name"], 10, "purple")
nametag(animalB) is text(animalB["name"], 10, "purple")
----

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @workbook-link{pages/design-recipe-2.adoc}, and use the Design Recipe to write both of these functions.

== Custom Scatter Plot Images @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover _functions that consume other functions_, and compose a scatter plot function with one of the functions they've already defined.

=== Launch
Students have used Pyret functions that use Numbers, Strings, Images, and even Tables and Rows. Now they've written functions of their own that work with these datatypes. However, Pyret functions can even use _other functions_! Have students at the Contract for `image-scatter-plot`:
----
 image-scatter-plot :: (t :: Table, xs :: String, ys :: String, f :: (Row -> Image)) -> Image
----
This function looks a lot like the regular `scatter-plot` function. It takes in a table, and the names of columns to use for x- and y-values. Take a closer look at the third input...
----
...f :: (Row -> Image)...
----
_That looks like the contract for a function!_ Indeed, the third input to `image-scatter-plot` is named `f`, which itself is a function that consumes Rows and produces Images. In fact, students have just defined a function that does exactly that!

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Type `image-scatter-plot(animals-table, "pounds", "weeks", nametag)` into the Interactions Area. 
- What did you get?
- What other scatter plots could we create?

=== Synthesize

Functions are powerful tools, for both mathematics and programming. They allow us to create reusable chunks of logic that can be tested to ensure correctness, and can be used over and over to solve different kinds of problems. A little later on, you'll learn how to combine, or _compose_ functions together, in order to handle more complex problems.
