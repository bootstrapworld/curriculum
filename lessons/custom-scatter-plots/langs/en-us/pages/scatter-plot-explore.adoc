@n What information is included in the code that is not represented in the display?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ _species_}}

@n Open the @starter-file{custom-scatter-plot} and click Run. How does the _interactive chart_ use the `species` data?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_When you mouse over the dots, they are labeled with the species._}}

@n This file also uses the function `image-scatter-plot` whose contract is:

[.forceShading]
--
```
image-scatter-plot :: (
  t :: Table,
  xs :: String,
  ys :: String,
  f  :: (Row -> Image)
) -> Image
```
--

What is its Domain?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Table, String, String, and a Row->Image Function_}}

@n How is this Domain different from other functions we've seen?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_It includes a function!_}}
