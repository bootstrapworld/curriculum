== Image Scatter Plots @duration{40 minutes}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to their first example of a _custom scatter plot_, which makes use of the @show{(code 'image-scatter-plot)} function to replace each animals' dot with the name of the species. They then write code for another custom scatter plot.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/age-v-weeks.gif, "Age v. Weeks Scatter Plot", 450}} Not all data points are created equal! Dogs and rabbits are very different, but when viewing all the animals on the same scatter plot, these differences are hidden.

This makes the displays more interesting, and helps us to dig deeper into analyzing the data.

=== Investigate

Let's start with some review, combining our knowledge of row and column lookups with our knowledge of how to define functions.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{defining-row-functions.adoc}, and complete numbers 1-3 at the top of the page.

Review students' answers to these first three questions. It's important to check for understanding before proceeding!

[.lesson-instruction]
Return to @printable-exercise{defining-row-functions.adoc}, and complete the rest of the page to define a function `species-tag`.

Review student answers before having them open the @starter-file{custom-scatter-plot} and read through the code.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Open @starter-file{custom-scatter-plot}
* How (if at all) does your definition of `species-tag` differ from what's here?
* What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
* What functions you see defined here? What do they do?
* What Rows do you see defined here?

The contract for `image-scatter-plot` looks pretty different from other contracts we've seen.

What is the Domain of `image-scatter-plot`?

_Table, String, String and... what is that last part?... *a Function that consumes a Row and produces an Image*!_

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{pages/custom-scatter-plot-explore.adoc}.

=== Synthesize

[.lesson-instruction]
How did having the dots labeled with the species change your understanding of the data?

Make sure to direct the conversation back to *Data Science!*
__This scatter plot makes it clear that we may want to analyze each species separately, rather than grouping them all together!__ In the Grouped Samples lesson, students will learn how to do just that.

@span{.center}{@image{images/species-tag.png, "A scatter plot with species names for each animal in place of a small, uniform dot. The images are generated by the species-tag function", 450}

[.lesson-instruction]
What did the other functions in the file do?

The `legs-tag` function _made blue rings whose size was determined by the number of legs the animal had. `age-tag` made stars whose size was double the age of the animal._

The images are generated by the age-tag function", 410}

[.lesson-instruction]
* What data type is `species-tag`?
** _A function that consumes a Row and produces an Image_
* What does the `species-tag` function do?
* How does `image-scatter-plot` work?
* What are some other ways you could use columns of the Animals Dataset to display more interesting image-scatter-plots?
* What does an `image-scatter-plot` expression need to have defined, in order to display a scatter plot with the animals' names in place of dots?
* How might `image-scatter-plot` be useful in your _own_ analysis?

== OPTIONAL: Using Conditionals @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover how to use conditionals - piecewise functions in math - to change dot colors and sizes, how "dot appearance" can be used to show more data in a scatter plot, and why that would be valuable.

*NOTE:* Math teachers alike may want their students to confront piecewise functions more deeply, and CS teachers may want to spend more time on conditionals. While not a part of the Data Science pathway, the @link{../piecewise-functions-conditionals/, Piecewise Functions and Conditionals} lesson includes a lot of supporting material and practice pages for these topics.

=== Launch
So far, we've seen that...

* the `scatter-plot` function makes uniform blue dots
* the `image-scatter-plot` function can label each point with some text, a different sized dot, or a star.

What other ideas do you have for how else we could make scatter plots be more interesting than the ones with plain blue dots?

_Students might suggest using other colors, using letters, using numbers, using coordinates, using different shapes, using different sizes, etc._

_To get more out of the `image-scatter-plot` function, we'll need to use a different kind of function called a "piecewise function"._

@comment{
[.lesson-instruction]
* Take a moment and make a prediction. How do you think the age of an animal impacts how long it takes to be adopted?
* Which of these scatter plots best matches your prediction?
}

[.lesson-instruction]
--
* Open the @opt-starter-file{piecewise-custom-scatter-plot} and complete @opt-printable-exercise{pages/species-dot-explore.adoc}.

@center{@image{images/age-v-weeks-species-dot.png, "Age v. Weeks Scatter Plot", 450}}

* What does this new visualization tell us about the relationship between age and weeks?
* What other analysis would be helpful here?
--

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
* Open @opt-printable-exercise{species-dot-dr.adoc}
* What is the contract for `species-dot`?
* What is the purpose of `species-dot`?
* How many examples do we need to write?
* OPTIONAL: Complete the @opt-printable-exercise{sex-dot-dr.adoc}, to write a new helper function that will make differently-colored dots based on the animals' sex.

Make sure that students write the Contract a __first__ , and check in with their partner __and__ the teacher before proceeding.

Once they've got the Contract, have them come up with `examples:` for _each sex_. Once again, have them check with a partner _and_ the teacher before finishing the page.

[.lesson-instruction]
Once another student _and_ the teacher have checked your work, type the `sex-dot` function into your starter file, and use it to make an `image-scatter-plot` using `age` as the x-axis and `weeks` as the y-axis.

Debrief, and ask students to explain what the code does. Pay special attention to students' ability to articulate the "if/then" statements!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @opt-printable-exercise{pages/species-image-explore.adoc} and open the @opt-starter-file{custom-animals} Starter File.
- How does using clipart help us to better understand the data?
- What _risks_ might there be to using clipart in displays?
- We have seen a lot of different image scatter plots today! What ideas do you have for how `image-scatter-plot` could be used to deepen the analysis of your dataset?

@span{.title}{ Optional: When your conditional is _already_ a Boolean }
If you have time or students who are ready for a challenge, you can also have them make a scatter plot for dots distinguishing whether the animal is fixed or not using the directions at the end of the starter file or @opt-printable-exercise{fixed-dot-dr.adoc}. Students will discover that this is a little different from the other two functions they've seen because `fixed` is already a Boolean column! The code will work if written in either of the following ways:
[.comparison, cols="<4a,<3a", options="header"]
!===
! Checking the Boolean
! Using the Boolean Directly

!
```
fun fixed-dot(r):
  if      (r["fixed"] == true) : circle(5, "solid", "green")
  else if (r["fixed"] == false): circle(5, "solid", "black")
  end
end
```
!
```
fun fixed-dot(r):
  if r["fixed"]: circle(5, "solid", "green")
  else: circle(5, "solid", "black")
  end
end
```
!===

For students who are really ready for a challenge, direct them to the @opt-starter-file{custom-scatter-plot-w-range} and @opt-printable-exercise{value-range-dot-explore.adoc}
