= Where did Shipwrecks happen in Southeast Asia?

@n Based on the map, what kinds of areas were common for shipwrecks? The open sea?  Near the coast? Towards China in the north, or further south?

Find the Java Sea shipwreck on the map (hint: it happened near the country of Java). Put a square around the shipwreck once you’ve located it on the map. 

@n Does it seem like the Java Sea ship was part of the same trade route that you saw for the 10 more recent wrecks?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n For different forms of transportation, does the geography of the land matter? How?

Here is a 1659 report by an eyewitness about the sinking of the Avondster, one of the shipwrecks we will study in this module:

	“to our great displeasure, on 2 July in the night, in Gale Bay, the old yacht Avondster, after her ropes had withstood the bad weather, in a light breeze slipped from her anchors and because of bad supervision perished.”

@n Why do you think we usually don’t have eyewitness reports about shipwrecks?
