| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Identify the value that an expression such as f(3) produces from a function definition, table, or graph.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can find the value of an expression such as f(3), given a table, graph or equation defining f(x).

== Function Notation - Substitution @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students connect their understanding of image functions to function notation in math.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
We've seen how we can produce images using functions like `gt` by substituting specific inputs for the variables in the definition.

@show{(code '(define (gt size)(triangle size "solid" "green")))}

[cols="2,3,1", options="header"]
|===
| Function Expression 				| What it Produces 											| Final Product
| @show{(code '(gt 10))} 		| @show{(code '(triangle 10 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt10.png, green triangle 10}
| @show{(code '(gt 20))} 		| @show{(code '(triangle 20 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt20.png, green triangle 20}
| @show{(code '(gt 30))} 		| @show{(code '(triangle 30 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt30.png, green triangle 30}
| @show{(code '(gt 40))} 		| @show{(code '(triangle 40 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt40.png, green triangle 40}
| @show{(code '(gt 50))} 		| @show{(code '(triangle 50 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt50.png, green triangle 50}

[.lesson-instruction]
In math class, we often use Function Notation to describe `Number` &rarr; `Number` functions.  We can compute the value of the expression for any specific input by substituting numbers for the variable(s) used in the definition, just as we did with `gt`.

@show{(code '(define (f x)(+ x 8)))}

[cols="2,3,1", options="header"]
|===
| Function Expression 		| What it Produces 				| Final Product
| @math{f(10)} 				| @show{(code '(+ 10 8))} 		| 18
| @math{f(20)} 				| @show{(code '(+ 20 8))} 		| 28
| @math{f(30)} 				| @show{(code '(+ 30 8))} 		| 38
| @math{f(40)} 				| @show{(code '(+ 40 8))} 		| 48
| @math{f(50)} 				| @show{(code '(+ 50 8))} 		| 58

=== Investigate

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{pages/match-examples-definitions-math.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/function-notation-substitution.adoc}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Start by looking at each table and highlighting what is changing from the first row to the following rows.
- Then, match each table to the function that defines it.

You may also want to have students complete @opt-online-exercise{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/60aa5c452505ed0802bfff38, Matching Examples & Function Definitions (Math)}

=== Synthesize

[.lesson-instruction]
--
What question could we ask that would return the same result as the expression @math{f(3)}?

** _What is the value of @math{x + 8} when @math{x} is 3?_
--
== Function Notation - Graphs @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students will learn to use Function Notation to describe specific values displayed in Graphs.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
--
If @math{f(x) = x - 5} what is the value of @math{f(7)}?

** _@math{2}. Because if we substitute 7 for x we get @math{7 - 5 = 2}_

Let's take a look at the graph of @math{f(x) = x - 5}...
--

@centered-image{images/gr1.png, "graph of the line f(x) = x - 5", 350}

[.lesson-instruction]
* How could we have determined that @math{f(7) = 2} from looking at the graph, if we hadn't started with the function definition?
** _We could have looked for a point whose x-coordinate was 2 and found the point (7, 2), the y-value is 2, which tells us that the output of the function when x is 7 is 2._
* From looking at the graph, what is the value of @math{f(3)}?
** _-2_
* What other values on this graph could we describe using function notation?
** _answers will vary... for example, @math{f(0) = -5} ...or... @math{f(0.5) = -4.5}_

=== Investigate

Have students complete @printable-exercise{function-notation-graphs.adoc}

=== Synthesize
[.lesson-instruction]
* Can you think of any values that it would be difficult to determine from one of these graphs?
** _It would be hard to be precise for many of the points on the graphs that curve. For example, @math{f(4)} on the second graph would have to be a decimal value and it's hard to know exactly what the decimal should be..._

== Function Notation - Tables @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students will learn to use Function Notation to describe specific values displayed in Tables.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
* Now let's take a look at a table of values that satisfy the function @math{f(x) = x - 5} and think about how could we have determined the value of @math{f(7)} from looking at the table.
** _We would just look for 7 in the x-column and see that the value beside it is 2._
* Looking at the table, what is the value of @math{f(-10)}?

* What did you Notice?
* What did you Wonder?
* A few of the tables did not represent functions. Which ones?
** _the last one in the top row, the last one in the middle row and the 3rd one in the bottom row._
* How did the fact that those tables weren't functions impact our ability to describe a value using function notation?
** _When x appeared more than once in the table and was associated with different outputs, it wasn't clear what number the expression should evaluate to._
