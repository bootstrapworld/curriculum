# Function Notation (Definitions)
 
 We’ve seen how functions like `gt` can be defined, and then applied to a number to create a green triangle. And once `gt` is defined, we can use it with many different numbers to create many different triangles - all without having to write out "solid", "green", etc.

But how does this function work?

# Function Notation (Definitions)

When we apply a function to the inputs it needs, we substitute those inputs for the variables in the definition.

# Function Notation (Definitions)

Math books use Function Notation to define functions, too, though most of the time their functions only work with numbers - and certainly not images!

# Function Notation (Definitions)

- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/match-examples-definitions-math.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/function-notation-substitution.adoc}.
- Look at each table and highlight what is changing from the first row to the following rows.
- Then, match each table to the function that defines it.

You can think of @math{f(3)} as a question.
* What question is it asking you to evaluate?
* What is another way you can ask it?

# Function Notation (Graphs)

If @math{f(x) = x - 5}, what is the value of @math{f(7)}, and why?

Let's take a look at the graph of @math{f(x) = x - 5}...

# Function Notation (Graphs)

We don’t need to know a function definition in order to use function notation to describe a value with an expression! Let’s take a look at the scatterplot below.{style="font-size:15pt"}

** _There isn't one! It's undefined._

# Function Notation (Grphas)

This works for even more complex functions, which we haven't seen yet!

When evaluating an expression for a piecewise function, points on the graph marked with hollow circles are boundary points, but not part of the solution set, so we ignore them and focus on the solid points. For example, on the graph below, when evaluating @math{f(2)}, we ignore the hollow point at @math{(2, 4)} and focus on the solid point at @math{(2,3)}, so @math{f(2) = 3}.

@image{images/pw.png, "graph of a piecewise function with 4 separate curvy and linear sections. Hollow endpoints at (0,2.5) and (2,4). solid endpoints at (0,3) and (2,3)"}

# Function Notation (Grphas)

Can you think of any values that it would be difficult to determine from one of these graphs?

<!--
It would be hard to be precise for many of the points on the graphs that curve. For example, f(4) on the second graph would have to be a decimal value and it’s hard to know exactly what the decimal should be without a function definition to evaluate.

Let’s take a look at a table of input-output pairs that satisfy the function f(x)=x−5, and think about how could we have determined the value of f(7) from looking at the table.

Looking at the table, what is the value of f(−10)?

What did you Notice?

What did you Wonder?

A few of the tables did not represent functions. Which ones?

How did the fact that those tables weren’t functions impact our ability to describe a value using function notation?


<!-- Response to the last two questions: The last one in the top row, the last one in the middle row and the 3rd one in the bottom row; When x appeared more than once in the table and was associated with different outputs, it wasn’t clear what number the expression should evaluate to.
