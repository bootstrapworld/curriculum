*Word Problem:* __It's normal to tip 20% on a bill at a restaurant. Write a function that takes in the total on the bill, and returns the new total that adds a 20% tip.__

To solve this word problem, Zahara defined the following function, *which runs without any errors*:
@span{.center}{
	@show{(sexp->code '(define (check-total bill) (* 0.2 bill)))}
}

@n Can you see what is wrong with this definition?

@span{.blankline}{
	@ifsoln{The function computes the tip, but does not add it to the price of the bill.}
}
@span{.blankline}{}

To explain their thinking, they filled out the following Design Recipe:

| @include{fragments/check-total.adoc}

@n Read each step in the recipe carefully. In which step did their thinking first go wrong? (circle one)

| @ifnotsoln{Examples {amp} Labels} @ifsoln{*_Examples {amp} Labels_*}
| Definition

@n What could they have done to find or avoid the mistake in the first place?
@span{.blankline}{
	@ifsoln{They could have checked to see if their examples really matched the purpose statement,}
}
@span{.blankline}{@ifsoln{Or used a simpler example to check their calculations}}
@span{.blankline}{}
