*Word Problem:* __All students are given five (5) pencils at the beginning of the school year. Write a function called calc-pencils that takes in the number of students in the school and calculates the number of pencils needed for that school.__

To solve this word problem, Louis defined the following function, *which runs without any errors*:
@span{.center}{
	@show{(sexp->code '(define (calc-pencils p) (/ p 5)))}
}

@n Can you see what is wrong with this definition?

@span{.blankline}{
	@ifsoln{The word problem is supposed to take in the number of students and compute the number of pencils, but this does the opposite.}
}
@span{.blankline}{}

To explain their thinking, they filled out the following Design Recipe:

| @include{fragments/calc-pencils.adoc}

@n Read each step in the recipe carefully. In which step did their thinking first go wrong? (circle one)

| Definition

@vspace{1ex}

@n What could they have done to find or avoid the mistake in the first place?
@span{.blankline}{
	@ifsoln{Their purpose was incomplete, and did not match the word problem.}
}
@span{.blankline}{@ifsoln{Thinking through a simple example with 1 student would have helped.}}
