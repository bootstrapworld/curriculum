= Practicing Contracts

Consider the following contract:

----
rotate :: (degree :: Number, img :: Image) -> Image
----

What is the *Name* of this function? 
@fitb{30em}{rotate}

@vspace{3ex}

How many things are in this function's  *Domain*? 
@fitb{30em}{2}

@vspace{3ex}

What is the *type* of this function's  *first argument*?
@fitb{30em}{Number}

@vspace{3ex}

What is the *name* of this function's  *second argument*?
@fitb{30em}{img}

@vspace{3ex}

What is the *Range* of this function? @fitb{15em}{Image}.

@vspace{3ex}

Circle the expression below that shows the correct application of this function, based on its contract.

@vspace{3ex}

1. `rotate(45, 90)`

2. `rotate(circle(99, "solid", "green"))`

3. *rotate(25, rectangle(7, 10, "outline", "black"))*

4. `rotate(rectangle(7, 10, "outline", "black"), 25)`
