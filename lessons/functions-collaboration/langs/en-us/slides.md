Once completed, the set of functions generated from these Word Problem Set 1 can be used to fix the code in this @opt-starter-file{collaboration}. If all the functions are defined correctly, the starter file will then generate a cool image!

A third option is to use any of the practice problems in the workbook that students haven't solved before. There is a large collection of math problems that would work well with the Design Recipe in our @link{bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/functions-solving-word-problems, Solving Word Problems Using the Design Recipe} lesson.

# Design Recipe Telephone

In this activity, each person in your group will start with a different word problem.

- You will each be doing one step of each Design Recipe problem.
- When you complete that step, you will fold your paper to hide the part that you were looking at so that only your work and the rest of the recipe is visible.
- Then you will pass your work to the person to your right so that they can complete the next step based solely on what you write down.
- The student who continues working the problem you start will be dependent on your work, so pay careful attention to making your part as precisely as possible.
- If you don’t provide enough information, they may have to hand the paper back to you for revision.

# Where'd You Get That?

Two students (1 and 2) start with a finished Design Recipe.

1. Beginning with the Definition at the bottom of the page, student 1 points to the function name and asks “Where’d you get that?” Student 2 explains, using only what is written in the example step above. Repeats for everything in the Definition.

1. Student 2 points to the function name in the first example, and asks “Where’d you get that? Student 1 explains, using only what is written in the Contract & Purpose above. Repeat for everything in the Examples.


1. They switch places and repeat for the Contract & Purpose, now pointing back to the word problem.

# Design Recipe Telephone

The Design Recipe is a way of slowing down and thinking through each step of a problem. 

If we already know how to get the answer, why would it ever be important to know how to do each step the slow way?

<!--
Sample Responses: Someday we won’t be able to get the answer, and knowing the steps will help; So we can help someone else who is stuck; So we can work with someone else and share our thinking; So we can check our work
