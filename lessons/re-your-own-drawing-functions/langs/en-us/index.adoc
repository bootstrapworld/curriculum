== draw-state for a Single Number (Time 30 minutes)

The majority of reactive programs you’ll write in this course
will use data structures consisting of multiple pieces of data,
whether that be Numbers, Strings, Images, or Booleans. However,
it’s not _required_ to have a full data structure in order to use a
reactor. In fact, we can create an animation based on just a
single number!

[.lesson-instruction]
Open the
https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=0B9rKDmABYlJVSFRPYWlsajJ1SmM[Blank
Single Number draw-state] file and take a look at
the code. Before hitting "`Run`", can you guess what this code will
do?

----
include image
include reactors

# next-state-tick :: Number -> Number
fun next-state-tick(n):
  n + 1
end

# draw-state :: Number -> Image
fun draw-state(n):

  "fix me!"

end

num-react = reactor:
  init: 1,
  # to-draw: draw-state,
  on-tick: next-state-tick
end

interact(num-react)
----

Notice how there is no `data` block in this file. Both the
`next-state-tick` and the `draw-state` function consume a single
number, and the initial value given to the reactor is also a
single number (in this case, 1.)

[.lesson-instruction]
Click `Run`. What do you see?

According to the `next-state-tick` function, on every clock tick
the state (a single number) will increase by one, which is
exactly what happens. Since we didn’t tell the reactor how to
draw the state (the `to-draw` part of the reactor is commented
out), when the reactor runs we see the state of the reactor (a
single number) increasing, instead of an animation.

[.lesson-instruction]
What do you think would happen if we had a reactor with a
complete `draw-state` function, but a `next-state-tick` function that
never updated the state? (Consuming and producing the same
value.)

////
Reinforce the fact that, although the draw-state and
next-state-tick functions work together within a reactor to
produce an animation, each function can work without the other.
In this example, next-state-tick will update the state even
without a function to draw the state.
////

There are much more interesting things we can display using a
number as the state of the reactor, however!

[.lesson-instruction]
Change the `draw-state` function so that it consumes a Number and
produces an image. Then, uncomment the `to-draw: draw-state` line
in the reactor to see an animation when the program runs!

////
Encourage students to brainstorm and share ideas for the
draw-state function before beginning. Some possible options
include:

Drawing a star of size n (so that it gets larger on each tick)
Display n as an image using the text function.
Have students share back the draw-state functions they wrote.
////

== draw-state for Two Numbers (Time 30 minutes)

You’ve practiced writing a `draw-state` function using a single
number as a state, now let’s look at something a bit more
familiar.

[.lesson-instruction]
Open the Blank 2 Number draw-state file and take a look at the code.

----
include image
include reactors

data AnimationState:
  | state(
      a :: Number,
      b :: Number)
end

START = state(1, 100)

# next-state-tick :: AnimationState -> AnimationState
fun next-state-tick(s):
  state(s.a + 1, s.b - 1)
end

# draw-state :: AnimationState -> Image
fun draw-state(s):

  "fix me!"

end

state-react = reactor:
  init: START,
# to-draw: draw-state,
  on-tick: next-state-tick
end

interact(state-react)
----

This code includes a data structure (called `AnimationState`)
containing two numbers as its fields, `a` and `b`. As before, the
`draw-state` function is incomplete, and commented out from the
reactor.

[.lesson-instruction]
Based on the `next-state-tick` function defined here, what do you
think will happen when you hit ’Run’? Discuss with your partner,
then try it out!

With only the `next-state-tick` function, we can see the state
updating, increasing the first number by 1 and decreasing the
second number by 1 each tick.

[.lesson-instruction]
How could you define a `draw-state` function to show something
interesting when the program runs? Branstorm with your partner,
then change the existing, broken `draw-state` function to consume
an `AnimationState` and produce an image. Then, comment out the
`to-draw: draw-state` line in the reactor to see an animation when
the program runs!

////
Some possible ideas for this activity:

Display two shapes of size a and b, which get larger and smaller,
respectively, as the reactor runs.

Make a and b the coordinates of an image, moving down and to the right across a background as the reactor runs.

Have students share back what they brainstormed before beginning,
then share the completed draw-state functions they wrote, and the
animations they created!
