# Navigating a Grid

Computers use numbers to represent a character’s position on screen, using number lines as rulers to measure the distance from the bottom-left corner of the screen. For our videogame, we will draw the number line so that the screen runs from 0 (on the left) to 1000 (on the right).

# Navigating a Grid

But one number line isn't enough!

@image{images/dog.png, dog character}{width="150"}

<!--
	What is the coordinate of the Dog, if it’s on the left-hand edge of the screen?
What is the coordinate of the Dog, if it’s on the right-hand edge of the screen?
What is the coordinate of the Dog, if it’s in the center of the screen?
What coordinate would place the Dog beyond the left-hand edge of the screen?
What coordinate would place the Dog beyond the right-hand edge of the screen?

1. Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/Estimation.adoc}.

1. For each character, _estimate_ what you think the x- and y- coordinates are.

# Navigating a Grid


- Should any of the characters have x-coordinates that are very similar? How come?
- Should any of the characters have y-coordinates that are very similar? How come?
- How do you think this concept relates to a video game?

With your partner, adjust the sliders to move the cat on @online-exercise{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pbm9nxr2rd, Ninja Cat Desmos graph}.

Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/NoticeAndWonder.adoc}. 

What do you Notice?

What do you Wonder?

# Bridging to Video Games

Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/BrainstormGame.adoc}.

As a group, come up with at least one idea for a game!
- Every game has a BACKGROUND (where the game is set)
- Every game has a PLAYER (moves up and down)
- Every game has a DANGER (moves left/right - lose points if you hit!)
- Every game has a TARGET (moves left/right - gain points if you hit!)

Find images for your game! Tip: @link{http://www.DuckDuckGo.com, DuckDuckGo} is a great place to find transparent images.

Use this @link{https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1xXNWcbJ7KOgTClFQeHq-tIy0xmeZds9N3OktvEBaO4c/copy, Google Draw template} to create a Screenshot.

Screenshot must include:
- Estimates of coordinates for each character.
- 2 characters that have similar x-coordinates.
- 2 characters that have similar y-coordinates.

What games did you come up with?

What are the coordinates of the dog before it gets onscreen?

Why do we make estimates? 

What makes a good estimate?

How can we improve our estimation skills?
