@n Each language has its own symbol for commenting code so that programmers can leave notes that won't be read by the computer. @ifproglang{wescheme}{In WeScheme, we use the semicolon (`;`).}
@ifproglang{pyret}{In Pyret, we use the hash mark (`#`).}
What color are comments in @proglang? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@ifproglang{wescheme}{Purple}@ifproglang{pyret}{Orange-Brown}}}

@n Type `japan-flag` into the Interactions Area. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see Japan's flag - a white background with}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a red dot in the center.}}

@n Type `japan` into the Interactions Area and compare the image to `japan-flag`.

- How are they alike? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see a variant of Japan's flag. The dot is the same color.}}

- How are they different? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The dot is in the lower left now. The dot is a different size.}}

@n `japan` is composed using `dot` and `background`. Type each of those variables into the Interactions Area. What do you get back?

- `dot`: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see a 100-pixel solid red circle}}
- `background`: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see a black-outlined rectangle that is 300 pixels by 200 pixels}}

@n These images are combined using the `translate` function. What is its contract? @fitb{}{@showsoln{(contract 'translate '(Image Number Number Image) "Image")}

@n Fix the `japan` code so that it matches the `japan-flag` image. What did you need to change? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We need to change the coordinates to (150, 100). We need to resize the red dot to about 60 pixels.}}

@n How can you prove that you have placed the `dot` in exactly the right location? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The x-coordinate is 150 (half of 300) and the y-coordinate is 100 (half of 200)}}

@n What was the programmer thinking when she coded the height of the red stripe as @show{(code '(/ 200 3))}? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The red stripe's height is one-third of the total height (200).}}

@n The center of the blue stripe is placed at (@show{(code `150)}, @show{(code '(/ 200 6))}). How did the programmer know to use 150 as the x-coordinate? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{150 is half of the rectangle's width; that position will horizontally center the blue stripe.}}

@n What was the programmer thinking when she coded the y-coordinate as @show{(code '(/ 200 6))}? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each stripe occupies 1/3 of the flag's total height. That means the vertical center of the blue stripe is at 1/6 of the flag's height.}}

@n Explain the thinking behind coding the red stripe's y-coordinate as @show{(code '(* 5 (/ 200 6)))}.@fitb{}{}


@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The red strip's vertical center is at 5/6 of the flag's total height.}}

@n What advantages are there to representing height / length / width as fractions (as we see in this code) rather than using a computed value? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We can be more precise. There is no need to round. The fraction allows us to see some of the coder's thought process.}}
