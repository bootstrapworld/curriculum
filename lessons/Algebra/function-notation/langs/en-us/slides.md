# Function Notation (Definitions)
 
 We’ve seen how functions like `gt` can be defined, and then applied to a number to create a green triangle. And once `gt` is defined, we can use it with many different numbers to create many different triangles - all without having to write out "solid", "green", etc.

But how does this function work?

# Function Notation (Definitions)

When applying a function to its inputs, we substitute for the variables in its definition. {style="font-size:13pt"}

# Function Notation (Definitions)

Math books use Function Notation to define functions, too, though most of the time their functions only work with numbers - and certainly not images! {style="font-size:15pt"}

# Function Notation (Definitions)

- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/match-examples-definitions-math.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/function-notation-substitution.adoc}.
- Look at each table and highlight what is changing from the first row to the following rows.
- Then, match each table to the function that defines it.

# Function Notation (Definitions)

You can think of @math{f(3)} as a question.
1. What question is it asking you to evaluate?
1. What is another way you can ask it?


<!--
You can think of @math{f(3)} as a question.
1. _What is the value of @math{x + 8} when @math{x} is 3?_
1. _What is @math{3 + 8}?_

If @math{f(x) = x - 5}, what is the value of @math{f(7)}, and why?

<!--
@math{f(7) = 2} because @math{7 - 5 = 2}.

1. How could we determine that @math{f(7) = 2} from looking at the graph, if we hadn't started with the function definition?{style="font-size:15pt"}
1. Based on the graph, what is the value of @math{f(3)}?{style="font-size:15pt"}
1. What other values could you identify?{style="font-size:15pt"}

<!--
1. _We could have looked for a point whose x-coordinate was 2 and found the point (7, 2), the y-value is 2, which tells us that the output of the function when x is 7 is 2._
1. _-2_

This works for even more complex functions, which we haven't seen yet!{style="font-size:15pt"}

For piecewise functions, like the one to the right,{style="font-size:15pt"}
* Points on the graph marked with hollow circles are boundary points, but not part of the solution set.{style="font-size:15pt"} 

For example, to evaluate @math{f(2)}:{style="font-size:15pt"}

* ignore the hollow point at @math{(2, 4)}{style="font-size:15pt"} 
* focus on the solid point at @math{(2,3)}{style="font-size:15pt"}
* @math{f(2) = 3}{style="font-size:15pt"}

Can you think of any values that it would be difficult to determine from one of the graphs on @printable-exercise{function-notation-graphs.adoc}?

<!--
It would be hard to be precise for many of the points on the graphs that curve. For example, f(4) on the second graph would have to be a decimal value and it’s hard to know exactly what the decimal should be without a function definition to evaluate.

# Function Notation (Tables)

@table{6}
| x | -10 | -5  | 5 | 7 | 13
| y | -15 | -10 | 0 | 2 | 8

Let’s take a look at a table of input-output pairs that satisfy the function @math{f(x)=x−5}.

1. How we could have determined the value of @math{f(7)} from looking at the table.
1. What is the value of @math{f(−10)}?

<!--
1. _We'd find where the x-value is 7 and see that the corresponding y-value is 2._
1. _@math{-15}_

#Function Notation (Tables)

What did you Notice?

What did you Wonder?

A few of the tables on @printable-exercise{function-notation-tables.adoc} did not represent functions. Which ones?

How did the fact that those tables weren’t functions impact our ability to describe a value using function notation?


<!-- 
* Which tables didn't represent functions? _The last one in the top row, the last one in the middle row and the 3rd one in the bottom row_
* How did the fact that those tables weren’t functions impact our ability to describe a value using function notation? _When x appeared more than once in the table and was associated with different outputs, it wasn’t clear what number the expression should evaluate to._
