= Problem Decomposition


- Sometimes a problem is too complicated to solve all at once. Maybe there are too many variables, or there is just so much information that we can't get a handle on it!

- We can use *Problem Decomposition* to break those problems down into simpler pieces, and then work with the pieces to solve the whole. There are two strategies we can use for decomposition:

** *Top-Down* - Start with the "big picture", writing functions or equations that describe the connections between parts of the problem. Then, work on defining those parts.

** *Bottom-Up* - Start with the smaller parts, writing functions or equations that describe the parts we understand. Then, connect those parts together to solve the whole problem.

- You may find that one strategy works better for some types of problems than another, so make sure you're comfortable using either one!
