@n Whose expressions will work? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Roux, Josie & Celine all wrote expressions that will work.}}

@n How do you know? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{In order to find the scale factor for a pair of similar figures:}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{first, identify a pair of corresponding sides (this rules out Cedric's expression) }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{then divide the side length of the target size by the side length of the original size (this rules out Zuni's expression)}}

@n Which one would you use and why? @fitb{}{}

@n Write at least two expressions for generating the image titled BIKE by scaling `bike`.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(scale (/ 12 5) bike))}  @showsoln{(code '(scale (/ 19.2 8) bike))} @showsoln{(code '(scale 2.4 bike))}
