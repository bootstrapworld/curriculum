== Using `line-length`

_Click Run, and practice using `line-length` in the @vocab{Interactions Area} with different values for `a` and `b`._

@n What does the `line-length` function _do?_ +
@blanklines{4}{
@ifsoln{Subtracts the smaller input from the bigger one, which computes the distance between those points on a number line}
}

@n Why does it use conditionals? +
@blanklines{4}{
@ifsoln{Sometimes we want to subtract the first input from the second, and sometimes we want to subtract the second from the first.}
}

@n Why is the distance between two points always positive? +
@blanklines{4}{
@ifsoln{The distance between two points is the same, regardless of where one starts}
} +
