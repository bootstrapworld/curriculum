== Reading Code:

Distance between the Pyret and the boot:

@center{@show{(code '(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length 9 -3)) (sqr (line-length 3 -2)))))}}

@center{@image{../images/coordinates-1.png, 350}}

@n Where do the 9 and -3 come from? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the x-coordinates of the 2 points}}

@n Where to the 3 and -2 come from? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the y-coordinates of the 2 points}}

@n Explain how the code works.
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It calculates the horizontal distance and squares it, calculates the vertical distance and squares it...}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{then finds the sum of these two squares and takes the square root of their sum.}}

== Writing Code

@centered-image{../images/coordinates-2.png, 350}

@vspace{1ex}

Now write the code to find the distance between this boot and pyret.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length 8 0)) (sqr (line-length 7 1)))))} @ifsoln{@hspace{2em} OR}}

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length 0 8)) (sqr (line-length 1 7)))))}}
