== How distance is computed in @proglang

- The distance between @math{x_{1}} and @math{x_{2}} is computed by @show{(sexp->code '(line-length x1 x2))}.
- The distance between @math{y_{1}} and @math{y_{2}} is computed by @show{(sexp->code '(line-length y1 y2))}. +
- The equation to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are those lengths is: +
@vspace{1em} +
@center{@big{@math{\sqrt{\mbox{line-length}(x_{2}, x_{1})^2 + \mbox{line-length}(y_{2}, y_{1})^2}}}}

== Applying that to our Game

@n Suppose your player is at @ifnotsoln{@big{*(0, 2)*}} @ifsoln{(@fitbruby{2em}{0}{x1}, @fitbruby{2em}{2}{y1})} and a character is at @ifnotsoln{@big{*(4, 5)*}} @ifsoln{(@fitbruby{2em}{4}{x2}, @fitbruby{2em}{5}{y2})}. +

@vspace{5ex} +

@indented{*Label each of the coordinates above with one of the following*: @math{x_{1}}, @math{y_{1}}, @math{x_{2}}, @math{y_{2}}.}

@n After we substitute these coordinates into our initial equation, we can compute the distance between these points using: +
@vspace{1ex} +
@center{@big{@math{\sqrt{\mbox{line-length}(4, 0)^2 + \mbox{line-length}(5, 2)^2}}}}

@indented{*Translate this expression for calculating the distance between (0,2) and (4, 5) into a Circle of Evaluation*.}

@n *Convert the Circle of Evaluation to Code below*.

@teacher{In the starter file, students will see: +
the player's coordinates (px, py) instead of @math{(x_1, y_1)} +
the character's coordinates (cx, cy) instead of @math{(x_2, y_2)} ... these are used for any danger or target
