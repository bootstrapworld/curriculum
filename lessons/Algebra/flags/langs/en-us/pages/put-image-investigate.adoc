@n @ifproglang{wescheme}{Each language has its own symbol for commenting. In WeScheme, we use the semi colon (`;`) to tell the computer to ignore what we're typing. What color does the code turn when it has a semicolon in front of it?} @ifproglang{pyret}{In Pyret, we use the number sign (`#`) to tell the computer to ignore what we're typing. What color does the code turn when it has a number sign in front of it?}@fitb{25px}{@ifsoln{@ifproglang{wescheme}{Purple.}@ifproglang{pyret}{Red.}}}


@n Type `japan-flag` into the Interactions Area. What do you get back?@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see Japan's flag - a white background with}

@fitb{}{a red dot in the center.}

@n Type `japan` into the Interactions Area and compare the image to `japan-flag`. How are they alike? How are they different?@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see a variant of Japan's flag; the dot is in the lower left now. The dot is the same color but a different size.}

@fitb{}{}

@n `japan` is composed using `dot` and `background`. Type each of those variables into the Interactions Area. What do you get back?

- dot: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see a 100-pixel solid red circle}}
- background: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We see a black-outlined rectangle that is 300 pixels by 200 pixels}}

@n Fix the `japan` code so that it matches the `japan-flag` image. What did you need to change? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We need to change the coordinates to (150, 100). We need to resize the red dot to about 60 pixels.}}

@n What is the Contract for `put-image`?@fitb{}{}

== The Netherlands

For this section of the page, you will refer to the @starter-file{flags-2}.

@n What was the programmer thinking when she coded the height of the red stripe as @show{(code '(/ 200 3))}?}@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The red stripe's height is one-third of the total height (200).}}

@n The center of the blue stripe is placed at (@show{(code `150)}, @show{(code '(/ 200 6))}). How did the programmer know to use 150 as the x-coordinate?@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{150 is half of the rectangle's width; that position will horizontally center the blue stripe.}}

@n What was the programmer thinking when she coded the y-coordinate as @show{(code '(/ 200 6))}?}@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each stripe occupies 1/3 of the flag's total height. That means the vertical center of the blue stripe is at 1/6 of the flag's height.}}

@n Explain the thinking behind coding the red stripe's y-coordinate as @show{(code '(* 5 (/ 200 6)))}.@fitb{}{}


@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The red strip's vertical center is at 5/6 of the flag's total height.}}

@n What advantages are there to representing height, length, or width as fractions (as the coder did here) rather than computing and using the value?

@fitb{}{We can be more precise. There is no need to round. The fraction allows us to see some of the coder's thought process.}
