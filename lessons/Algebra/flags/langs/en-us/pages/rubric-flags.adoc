| Planning: Decomposing Flags Worksheet
| I correctly identified each of the shapes in the flag, along with their corresponding colors, widths, heights, and coordinates.
| I correctly identified more than half of the shapes in the flag, along with their corresponding colors, widths, heights, and coordinates.
| I correctly identified some of the shapes in the flag, along with their corresponding colors, widths, heights, and coordinates.


| Modeling: Paper Flags
| My paper model looks just like the flag I chose. All shapes are the correct sizes, and they are correctly positioned. My cutting and gluing is accurate and tidy.
| My paper model looks a lot like the flag I chose, but some (less than half) of the shapes are inaccurately sized or positioned incorrectly.
| My paper model barely looks like the flag I chose. Most (more than half) of the shapes are inaccurately sized and their positioning is incorrect. My cutting and gluing is messy.


| Starter File: Defining Shapes
| I have given each shape in my flag a sensible name and I have provided the correct code. When I type the shape names into the interactions area and hit enter, Pyret produces the image that I would expect it to produce.
| I have defined most of the shapes in my flag correctly, but there’s something wrong with one of my shapes (e.g., the color is off or the size is wrong).
| I have not defined all of the shapes in my flag, or I have defined all of the shapes but there’s something wrong with most of them (e.g., the color is off or the size is wrong).


| Starter File: Image Description
| I have thoughtfully, clearly, and accurately described my chosen flag as a comment.
| I have remembered to describe my chosen flag, but I’ve omitted an important detail in my description.
| I forgot to describe my chosen flag or my description is unclear and / or inaccurate.

| Starter File: Build the Image
| In the code that I wrote to build my flag, all of the coordinates are accurate. When I type the variable I chose for the image into the interactions area, Pryet produces a proportionally correct representation of my flag.
| In the code that I wrote to build my flag, most of the coordinates are accurate. When I type the variable I chose for the image into the interactions area, Pyret produces a representation of my flag that looks almost exactly like the original flag.
| In the code that I wrote to build my flag, some or none of the coordinates are correct. When I type the variable I chose for the image into the interactions area, Pyret produces a representation of my flag that looks different from the original flag.
