= Permutation and Combination

- What are the odds of guessing someone's 8-digit password?
- How many bouquets can we make choosing 4 different flowers from a collection of 10?
- If 10 runners enter a road race, how many different ways can they be ranked?
- If you pick two cards from a deck and they're both queens, what are the odds that the next card will be a queen?

Each of these questions deals with @vocab{permutation} or @vocab{combination}. Both concepts play a big role in probability and statistics. If you know how many possible outcomes there _could_ be, you can predict what your chances are. This is useful for competitive gaming, conducting surveys, and cybersecurity!

*Permutation* involves computing the number of different ways the same set of things can be re-arranged. If you have a dozen different doughnuts to choose from, how many different ways are there of _arranging_ six of them?

*Combination* involves computing the number of different _subsets_ you can make from the same set of things. If you have a dozen doughnuts to choose from, how many different half-dozen choices could you make?
