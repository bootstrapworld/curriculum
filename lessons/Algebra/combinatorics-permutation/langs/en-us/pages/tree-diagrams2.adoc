@n An ice cream truck sells 2-scoop cones, and each scoop can be Chocolate, Vanilla, or Strawberry. They also let you choose *one* topping: whipped cream or sprinkles. In the space below, draw the tree-diagram for all the possible ice cream cones you can order (with toppings!):

@n How many permutations are there for these 2-scoop cones and toppings?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ @math{\mbox{permute-w-replace}(3, 2) \times 2 = 3^2 \times 2 = 27} }}

@n Now the truck adds a 4th-flavor: _Rocky Road_. To get more people trying new flavors, the truck offers $1 off a 2-scoop cone, as long as both scoops are different flavors. In the space below, we've started making a list of every possible 2-scoop cone where both scoops are different. Can you finish the list?

@n How many different permutations are there for these ice cream cones?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ @math{\mbox{permute-wo-replace}(4, 2) \times 3 = \frac{4!}{(4 2)!} \times 3 = 48} }}
