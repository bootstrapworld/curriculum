= Challenge: update-player-2

@strategy{You have all the tools you need to work through this Design Recipe and get your player moving in all four directions if:}{
- your game is working
- both the `Danger` and `Target` return to the screen
- your `Player` moves up and down with the arrow keys
- you've completed @opt-printable-exercise{2d-character-movement.adoc}
- and your `Danger` is moving diagonally.
