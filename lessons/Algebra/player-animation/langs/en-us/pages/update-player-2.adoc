= Challenge: update-player-2

_If your game is working and..._

* _both the `Danger` and `Target` return to the screen_
* _your `Player` moves up and down with the arrow keys_
* _you've completed @opt-printable-exercise{2d-character-movement.adoc}_
* _your `Danger` is moving diagonally_

_you have all the tools you need to work through this Design Recipe and get your player moving in all four directions!_

_Follow the directions on @opt-printable-exercise{2d-character-movement-cont.adoc} for adding your new function to your game file, this time changing `update-player` to `update-player-2`._

Once you've mastered 2-dimensional movement, you might want to add secret functionality for some of your favorite letters on the keyboard...
