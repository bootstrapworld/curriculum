= Challenge: Character Movement in Two Dimensions

@strategy{You have all the tools you need to begin this challenge if:}{
- your game is working
- both the `Danger` and `Target` return to the screen
- your `Player` moves up and down with the arrow keys
}

@vspace{1ex}

@show{
  (contract "update-danger" '("Number") "Number"
	"consumes danger's x-coordinate and produces the next x-coordinate")
}

@vspace{1ex}

The `update-danger` function only moves our `DANGER` left or right. 

@vspace{1ex}

**Suppose we wanted to write a new function, `update-danger-2` that moves the `DANGER` _diagonally_...**

@n What, if anything will have to change about the Domain? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It will need two Numbers!}}

@n What, if anything, will have to change about the Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It will need a second Number.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
__Since an (x, y) coordinate has two Numbers, one idea might be to write the Contract this way:__

@vspace{1ex}

@show{
  (contract "update-danger-2" '("Number Number") "Number Number"
	"consumes danger's x- and y-coordinate, and produces the next x- and next y-coordinate")
}

@vspace{1ex}

__...But that Contract breaks an important rule about functions: Given an input, all functions must produce one output!__

}

@vspace{3ex}

We need some way to package two Numbers together into a single value.  Fortunately, @proglang has another data type, called a Posn. + 
The Posn datatype utilizes two Numbers to describe a __single__ "position"!

@vspace{3ex}

We can make a Posn to represent the position (100, 200) with the following code: 

@indented{@show{ (code '(make-posn 100 200)) }}

@n What expression will make a Posn representing the origin? @fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(make-posn 0 0))}}

@n Write the Contract for the @show{(code 'make-posn)} function on the line below.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(contract "make-posn" '("Number Number") "Posn")}}
