| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Model an @vocab{arithmetic expression} using @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.
* Translate Circles of Evaluation into code.

| Student-facing Goals
|
* Let's model @vocab{arithmetic expressions} visually with @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.
* Let's learn how Circles of Evaluation can be translated into code!

|Preparation
| * @optional If you want to engage your students with a hands-on activity as part of this lesson, be sure to print and cut out this @handout{pages/cards-for-matching-coe-exp.adoc, set of cards for physically matching arithmetic expressions with Circles of Evaluation}.
* In anticipation of the fact that students will likely finish the required materials in this lesson at very different speeds, preview the @link{#_additional_exercises, the Additional Exercises section} at the end of this lesson and decide which will be the best fit for your speedy students.
* There is an optional interactive Desmos activity in the lesson. If you would like to use it, decide how you will share it with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck. _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}


| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Error messages are the computer trying to give us a clue that something is wrong.  Model reacting to error messages with interest to demonstrate to students that the messages are a helpful tool.
* For a memory hook, model the "bug that crawls through the circle" explanation.
