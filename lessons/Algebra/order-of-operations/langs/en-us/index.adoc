- @opt{There is an optional interactive Desmos activity in the lesson.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- Error messages are the computer trying to give us a clue that something is wrong.  Model reacting to error messages with interest to demonstrate to students that the messages are a helpful tool.
- For a memory hook, model the "bug that crawls through the circle" explanation.

== Order of Operations @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are given a challenging expression that exposes common misconceptions about order of operations. The goal is to demonstrate that a brittle, fixed notion of order of operations is insufficient, and lead students to a deeper understanding of order of operations as a __grammatical__ device, rather than a computational one. The Circles of Evaluation can be thought of as "sentence diagramming for arithmetic".

@strategy{Circles of Evaluation}{


The Circles of Evaluation are a critical pedagogical tool in this course. They place the focus on the __structure__ of mathematical expressions, as a means of combating the harmful student belief that the only thing that matters is the __answer__.

@right{@image{images/pemdas.png, 200}}The order of operations are often summarized by models like this pyramid or mnemonics like PEMDAS, GEMDAS, etc. These rules are brittle, and don't always make it clear what we need to do.

Imagine a student with only these tools confronting the expression, @math{\frac{7 + 8}{2}} or @math{\sqrt{11 + 5} - 2}

What we need is a __better way to read math__!

Circles of Evaluation can be used to diagram arithmetic sentences to expose common misconceptions about Order of Operations, and make an excellent scaffold for tracing mistakes when a student applies the Order of Operations incorrectly. They are also a bridge representation, which naturally connects to function composition and converting arithmetic into code.
}

=== Launch

If you were to write instructions for getting ready for school, it would matter very much which instruction came first!

Imagine what might happen if someone tried to follow these steps:

1. Put on your sneakers.
2. Tie your sneakers.
3. Put on your socks.

@slidebreak

Sometimes we need multiple expressions in mathematics, and the order matters there, too!

Mathematicians didnâ€™t always agree on the Order of Operations, but at some point it became important to establish conventions that would allow them to work together.

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{

This math problem went viral on social media recently, with math teachers arguing about what the answer was!

@center{@big{@math{6 \div 2(1 + 2)}}}

- Take a minute to think about the answer before we learn a new strategy for _drawing the structure_ of this expression so that we can settle the debate!
- Then turn to @printable-exercise{coe-notice.adoc} and take a minute to record what you Notice and Wonder about the @vocab{Circles of Evaluation} you see.
- What did you Notice?
- What did you Wonder?
}

@slidebreak

**The rules for drawing Circles of Evaluation are simple:**

1) Every Circle must have one - and only one! - @ifproglang{pyret}{operator or} function, written at the top.

2) The inputs @ifproglang{wescheme}{to the function} are written left-to-right, inside the Circle.

3) Circles can contain other Circles.

The Circle of Evaluation for @math{8 \times (7 - 3)} is: @show{(coe '(* 8 (- 7 3)))}

@slidebreak

@ifnotslide{
@QandA{
@Q{Let's draw the Circle of Evaluation for the expression @math{10 - (5 + 3)}}
@Q{What should we do first?}
@A{It depends! We can either work

- outside in: @show{(coe '(- 10 ((?ANS +) (?ANS 5) (?ANS 3))))}

@strategy{Pedagogy Note}{
Circles of Evaluation are a great way to get older students to re-engage with (and finally understand) the order of operations while their focus and motivation are on learning to code.  Because we recognize this work to be so foundational, and know that some teachers choose to spend a whole week on it, we have developed lots of additional materials to help scaffold and stretch. You will find about 20 additional pages linked in @link{#_additional_exercises, the Additional Exercises section} at the the end of this lesson.

- Did you always prefer working outside-in to inside-out? Or did different strategies work better for different __kinds__ of problems? Why?
-
@teacher{Challenge students to try using the OTHER way to draw the Circle of Evaluation for the next one they draw!}

- Is there more than one way to draw the Circle for @smath{(+ 1 2)}?
  * If so, is one way more "correct" than the other?
- Up until now, we didn't have a visual spatial model for __reading__ arithmetic expressions...
  * How do Circles of Evaluation compare to previous methods you've learned for __computing__ what arithmetic expressions evaluate to (PEMDAS, GEMDAS, etc)?

== From Circles of Evaluation to Code  @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students learn how to use the Circles of Evaluation to translate arithmetic expressions into code.

=== Launch

Besides helping us to see the structure of mathematical expressions in order to evaluate them correctly, Circles of Evaluation can also be used to help us write code!

@lesson-instruction{
When converting a Circle of Evaluation to code, it's useful to imagine a "spider" crawling through the circle.
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
- The first thing the spider does is enter the circle by crossing over a curved line (an open parenthesis!).
- She then visits the operation - also called the __function__ - at the top.
- After that, she crawls from left to right, visiting each of the inputs to the function.
- Finally, she has to leave the circle by crossing another curved line (a close parenthesis).
}

}@ifslide{ }For Circles of Evaluation with __operators__ (addition, subtraction, etc.):

}

=== Common Misconceptions

@ifproglang{pyret}{
As in math, there are some cases where the outermost parentheses can be removed in Pyret:

- @math{(1 + 2)} can be safely written as @math{1 + 2}, and the same goes for the Pyret code
- @math{(1 * 2) * 3)} can be safely written as @math{1 * 2 * 3}, and the same goes for the Pyret code

You will likely see code written using this "shortcut", but it's always better to at least start with the parentheses to make sure your math/code is __correct__ before taking them out. It is never wrong to include them!
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
@teacher{
Eagle-eyed students may notice that WeScheme refers to the operator as a __function__, and ask why it isn't calling them operators. That's because **operators __are__ functions**, and the only reason we use different vocabulary is to differentiate the notational difference in math (operators go between their arguments, while functions come first). In WeScheme, the notation is the same and so is the vocabulary. This has the added advantage of helping students see the connection between operators and functions.

== Testing out your Code @duration{optional}

=== Overview

Circles of Evaluation are a powerful tool that can be used without ever getting students on computers. If you have time to introduce students to the @starter-file{editor}, typing their code into the Interactions Area gives students a chance to get feedback on their use of parentheses as well as the satisfaction of seeing their code successfully evaluate the expressions they've generated.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- Open @starter-file{editor} and click "Run".
- For now, we are only going to be working in the Interactions Area on the right hand side of your screen.
- Type @show{(code '(+ (* 8 2) (/ 6 3)))} into the Interactions Area.
- Notice how the editor highlights pairs of parentheses to help you confirm that you have closed each pair.
- Hit Enter (or Return) to evaluate this expression. What happens?
  * If you typed the code correctly you'll get 18.
  * If you make a mistake with your typing, the computer should help you identify your mistake so that you can correct it and try it again!__
- Take a few minutes to go back and test each line of code you wrote on the pages you've completed by typing them into the Interactions Area. Use the error messages to help you identify any missing characters and edit your code to get it working.
}
