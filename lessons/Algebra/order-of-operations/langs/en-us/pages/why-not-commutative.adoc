= Why isn't this expression Commutative?

You may have heard that "addition is commutative, so @smath{(+ a b)} can always be written as @smath{(+ b a)}." 

@hspace{3em} We know, for example, @smath{(+ 1 2)} can be transformed to @smath{(+ 2 1)}.

@vspace{1ex}

Suppose another student tells you that @smath{(+ 1 (* 2 3))} can be rewritten as @smath{(+ 2 (* 1 3))}. 

@hspace{3em} This is obviously wrong, but _why_ isn't that how the commutative property works?  _Take a moment to think: What's the problem?_

@n Draw the Circles of Evaluation to figure it out!

@n What do these Circles of Evaluation show us about why we can't use the commutative property to rewrite @smath{(+ 1 (* 2 3))} as @smath{(+ 2 (* 1 3))}?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In this case, the student _failed to see the structure_, viewing the term to the right of the @smath{+} sign as @smath{2} instead of @smath{(* 2 3)}. The Circles of Evaluation help }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{us see the structure of the expression, rather than forcing us to construct it and keep it in our heads.}}

@n Draw the Circles of Evaluation to decide whether or not these expressions will evaluate to the same thing.

@n Will @smath{(+ 5 (* 21 36))} and @smath{(+ (* 21 36) 5)} evaluate to the same thing? How do you know from looking at the Circles of Evaluation?
