== Part A

Here are two Circles of Evaluation @ifproglang{Pyret}{and their corresponding code}. One of them is familiar, but the other is very different from what we've been working with. 

@ifproglang{pyret}{
[cols="^1,^2", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe `(* 10 -4))}			| @show{(coe `(text "Good work!" 50 "red"))}
| Code: @show{(code `(* 10 -4))}	| Code: @show{(code `(text "Good work!" 50 "red"))}
|===
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
[cols="^1,^2", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(coe `(* 10 -4))}	| @show{(coe `(text "Good work!" 50 "red"))}
|===
}

@n *Focus on the Circles of Evaluation.* What do you Notice is different about the one on the right?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary! We've never seen `text` before. We've never seen *three* inputs.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We've never seen words like "red" used in a Circle of Evaluation before.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We've never seen a mix of Numbers and words.}}

@n What do you Wonder about the Circle of Evaluation on the Right?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
@n *Focus on the Code.* What do you Notice is different about the code on the right?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The function is in front of the parentheses!}}
}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are commas.}}

@n Can you figure out the Name for the function in the second Circle of Evaluation? 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We know the name of the function is `text`, because that's what is at the top of the circle.}}

@n What do you think this expression will evaluate to? @fitb{}{}

== Part B

@ifproglang{wescheme}{

@n Convert this Circle of Evaluation to Code:

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code `(text "Good work!" 50 "red"))}}
} 

@n Test the code out in @starter-file{editor}!

@n What does the `50` mean to the computer? _Try replacing it with different values, and see what you get._

@fitb{}{}

@n What does the `"red"` mean to the computer? _Try replacing it with different values, and see what you get._

*Here is another Circle of Evaluation to explore.*

@show{(coe `(string-length "fun!"))}
