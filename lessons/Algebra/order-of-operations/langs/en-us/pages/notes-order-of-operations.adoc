If you were to write instructions for getting ready for school, it would matter very much which instruction came first!

Imagine what might happen if someone tried to follow these steps: 

@vspace{1ex}

1. Put on your sneakers.
2. Tie your sneakers.
3. Put on your socks.
 
Sometimes we need multiple expressions in mathematics, and the order matters there, too!

Mathematicians didnâ€™t always agree on the *Order of Operations*, but at some point it became important to establish conventions that would allow them to work together.

@vspace{1ex}

To help us organize our math thinking into something we can trust, we can _diagram_ an expression using the *Circles of Evaluation*. 

@vspace{1ex}

For example, this expression: 

@vspace{1ex}

@hspace{1em}@big{@smath{(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7))}}

@vspace{1ex}

@hspace{1em}can be diagrammed as:

@center{@show{(coe `(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)))}}

@vspace{2ex}

*Order of Operations* is important when programming, too!

@vspace{1ex}

To convert a *Circle of Evaluation* into Code, we walk through the circle from outside-in, moving left-to-right.

@vspace{1ex}

1. Type an open parenthesis when we _start_ a circle.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
2. Once we're in a circle, we first write the *function* at the top, then write the inputs from left to right.
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
2. Once we're in a circle, we write whatever is on the left of the circle, then the *operation* at the top, and then whatever is on the right.
}

3. Type a close parenthesis when we _end_ a circle. 

So, the Circle of Evaluation above would be programmed as: +
@hspace{1em}@ifproglang{wescheme}{@show{(code '(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)))}}
@ifproglang{pyret}{@show{(code '(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)) #:parens true)}}
