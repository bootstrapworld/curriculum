If you were to write instructions for getting ready for school, it would matter very much which instruction came first!

Imagine what might happen if someone tried to follow these steps: 

1. Put on your sneakers.
2. Tie your sneakers.
3. Put on your socks.
 
Sometimes we need multiple expressions in mathematics, and the order matters there, too!

Mathematicians didn’t always agree on the *Order of Operations*, but at some point it became important to establish conventions that would allow them to work together.

To help us organize our math into something we can trust, we can _diagram_ a math expression using the *Circles of Evaluation*. For example, the expression @smath{(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7))} can be diagrammed as shown below.

@center{@show{(coe `(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)))}}

*Order of Operations* is important when programming, too!

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
To convert a *Circle of Evaluation* into Code, we walk through the circle from outside-in, moving left-to-right. We type an open parenthesis when we _start_ a circle, and a close parenthesis when we _end_ one. Once we're in a circle, we first write the *function* at the top, then write the inputs from left to right. The circle above, for example, would be programmed as @show{(code '(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)))}.

We type an open parenthesis when we _start_ a circle, and a close parenthesis when we _end_ one. Once we're in a circle, we write whatever is on the left of the circle, then the *operation* at the top, and then whatever is on the right. The circle above, for example, would be programmed as @show{(code '(+ (- 1 4) (* 10 7)) #:parens true)}.
