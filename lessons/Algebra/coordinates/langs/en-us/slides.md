# Navigating a Grid

Computers use numbers to represent a character’s position on screen, using number lines as rulers to measure the distance from the bottom-left corner of the screen. For this example, we will draw the number line so that the screen runs from 0 (on the left) to 1000 (on the right).

What coordinate would place the Dog beyond the left-hand edge of the screen?
What coordinate would place the Dog beyond the right-hand edge of the screen?

But one number line isn't enough!

# Navigating a Grid

By adding a second number line, we can locate a character _anywhere_ on the screen in either direction. The first line we drews is called the @vocab{x-axis}, which runs from left to right. The second line, which runs up and down, is called the @vocab{y-axis}. A 2-dimensional @vocab{coordinate} consists of both the x- and y-locations on the axes.{style=font-size:14pt}

A coordinate pair is always written in the form of (x, y). When we write down these coordinates, we always put the x before the y (just like in the alphabet!). Most of the time, you’ll see coordinates written like this: (200, 50) meaning that the x-coordinate is 200 and the y-coordinate is 50.{style=font-size:14pt}

1. Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/Estimation.adoc}.

1. For each character, _estimate_ what you think the x- and y- coordinates are.

- Should any of the characters have x-coordinates that are very similar? How come?
- Should any of the characters have y-coordinates that are very similar? How come?
- How do you think this concept relates to a video game? 

<!--
* Should any of the characters have x-coordinates that are very similar? How come?
** _Ninja Cat and the cloud have similar x-coordinates. They have the same horizontal position._
* Should any of the characters have y-coordinates that are very similar? How come?
** _The Ruby and the Dog have similar y-coordinates. They have the same vertical position._
* How do you think this concept relates to a video game?
** _Answers vary: we need to know where characters are on the screen, we need a way for players to interact with certain parts of the screen, etc_

As a group, come up with at least one idea for a game!
- Every game has a BACKGROUND (where the game is set)
- Every game has a PLAYER (moves up and down)
- Every game has a DANGER (moves left/right - lose points if you hit it!)
- Every game has a TARGET (moves left/right - gain points if you hit it!)

Use this @link{https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1xXNWcbJ7KOgTClFQeHq-tIy0xmeZds9N3OktvEBaO4c/copy, Google Draw template} to create a Screenshot.

Screenshot must include:
- BACKGROUND, PLAYER, DANGER, TARGET
- Estimates of coordinates for each character.
- 2 characters that have similar x-coordinates.
- 2 characters that have similar y-coordinates.

What games did you come up with?

What are the coordinates of the DANGER before it is on the screen?

Why do we make estimates? 

What makes a good estimate?

How can we improve our estimation skills?
