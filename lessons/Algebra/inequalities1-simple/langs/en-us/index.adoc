| Key Points for the Facilitator
| 
- A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images.  But unlike those types, there are only _two_ values: `true` and `false`. While simple to explain, this different behavior can be confusing for some students.
- Boolean-producing functions are essentially yes-or-no questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions.
- For example, @show{(code 'odd?)} and @show{(code 'even?)} @ifproglang{wescheme}{(pronounced "odd-huh?" and "even-huh?" in Scheme)} are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.

== Booleans

=== Overview

While students have been cursorily introduced to the @vocab{Boolean} data type in our @lesson-link{simple-data-types} lesson, Booleans are so different from other data types and so foundational to inequalities that this section reintroduces students to Booleans (by way of Circles of Evaluation and a starter file) in preparation for working with inequalities in the second section of the lesson.

@lesson-instruction{To get ourselves warmed up, evaluate these Circles of Evaluation, convert them into code, and then log into @starter-file{editor} and test them out.}

@lesson-instruction{Take a minute to think about the Circles of Evaluation below: What do you think the expressions mean? What do you expect them to evaluate to? 

Then convert these Circles of Evaluation to code and test them out.}

Values like `true` and `false` obviously aren't Numbers or Images. But they also aren't Strings, or else they would have quotes around them. We've found a _new data type_, called a @vocab{Boolean}.

@lesson-point{
@vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Number or Image. There are only two Boolean values: `true` and `false`.
}

=== Investigate
@slidestyle{Investigate-DN}

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @printable-exercise{boolean-functions.adoc} and use the @starter-file{boolean} to complete the questions.
}

@teacher{

- Students will see functions in this activity that they've never encountered before ( @show{(code 'odd?)}, @show{(code 'even?)}, @show{(code 'less-than-one?)}, @show{(code 'continent?)}, and @show{(code 'primary-color?)})! All five functions produce @vocab{Booleans}. 
- Instead of answering their questions, encourage them to make a _guess_ about what they do, and then type it in to discover for themselves.
- Explicitly point out that _everything they know still works!_ They can use their reasoning about Circles of Evaluation and Contracts to figure things out.
}

=== Common Misconceptions
Many students - especially traditionally high-achieving ones - will be very concerned about writing examples that are "wrong." The misconception here is that an expression that produces `false` is somehow _incorrect_. You can preempt this by explaining that our Boolean-producing functions _should sometimes return false_.

== Introducing Inequalities

=== Overview
Students discover (or expand their understanding of) inequalities by identifying solutions and non-solutions and connecting expressions to graphic representations.

=== Launch
@slidestyle{Launch}

@lesson-instruction{
How are equations different from inequalities?
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

@vocab{Equations} typically have finite solution sets: there's only one answer for an unknown, or perhaps several answers. 

@vocab{Inequalities}, on the other hand, can have _infinite_ solutions.  Inequality expressions divide all of the numbers in the universe into two categories: solutions and non-solutions.

@teacher{It is important that students learn to recognize that there are many possible solutions and non-solutions to an inequality and are able to identify whether or not a given number is or isn't part of the @vocab{solution set}.}

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

@lesson-instruction{
- We are going to practice identifying whether or not a given number is part of the @vocab{solution set}.
- Open the @starter-file{inequalities-simple} and click "Run".
- This starter file includes a special `inequality` function that takes in a function _(which tests numbers in an inequality)_ and a list of 8 numbers _(to test in the function)_.
- Look at the graph that appears (image below), as well as the provided code.
@image{images/listA.png}
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
}

@teacher{
Be sure to surface the following:

- When we click "Run", we see a graph of the inequality on a number line.

- The solution set is shaded in blue.

- The 8 numbers provided in the list are shown as dots on the number-line. They will appear:
  * green _when they're part of the solution set_
  * red _when they are non-solutions_
}

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

@lesson-instruction{
- Find line 17 in the @starter-file{inequalities-simple}. Edit the list of values by changing one of the negative values to positive.
- Hit "Run". Examine the graph that appears (sample image below).
@image{images/listAedit.png}
- How is this graph different from the one you first produced?
}

@teacher{
A successful input in this starter file will include 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions; in other words, the image returned will show 4 green dots and 4 red dots.

When students modify the list of numbers, they will see there are now 3 green dots and 5 red dots - along with a message that says, _"Challenge yourself: Find 4 true examples and 4 false"_.
}

=== Investigate
@slidestyle{Investigate-DN}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{simple-inequalities.adoc} with a partner, identifying solutions and non-solutions to each inequality and testing them in the @starter-file{inequalities-simple}.
- For each inequality, you must find four solutions and four non-solutions.
- Try using negatives, positives, fractions and decimals as you generate your lists.
}

=== Synthesize
@slidestyle{Synthesize}
What patterns did you observe in how the inequalities worked?
