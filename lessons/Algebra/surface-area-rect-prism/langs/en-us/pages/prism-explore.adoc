@n What do you picture in your mind when you hear _rectangular prism_?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a box}}

@n What do you picture in your mind when you hear _surface area_?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the area of the faces on the outside of a shape}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Open the @starter-file{prism} and click "Run". Type `prism` into the Interactions Area and hit "enter" to see an image of a rectangular prism.  What do you notice about the image?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n How many faces does this prism have? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{6}}

@vspace{1ex}

*Find PART 1 in the starter file. You will see a definition for `front` and `back`.*

@n How did the author know to use width and height as the dimensions for `front` and `back`?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Why are `front` and `back` defined to be the same thing?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_In a rectangular prism, parallel faces are all identical_}}

@n Add definitions for the other faces of the prism, using these definitions as a model, and the image of the prism as a support.

@vspace{1ex}

*Find PART 2 in the starter file. You'll see a list that only includes `front` and `back`.*

@n Complete the faces list, then type @show{(code '(print-imgs faces))} into the interactions area. What do you see?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{all six faces of the prism appear}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*We're going to print the faces following directions in PART 3 and build a paper model of a rectangular prism.*

_Before you print and build your prism, you can change the length, width, and height of your prism at the top of the starter file. Be sure that all 3 dimensions are different, and that they are all small enough to fit on a sheet of paper. If you change them, record your new dimensions here._

LENGTH: @fitb{10em}{} WIDTH: @fitb{10em}{} HEIGHT: @fitb{10em}{}

//@n What units are the dimensions of the prism given in? @fitb{}{}

//@n What units should the surface area be given in? @fitb{}{}

@n Calculate the surface area of your prism, by adding the area of each face. @fitb{20ex}{} Show your work below.

@vspace{10ex}

@n In PART 4 of the starter file, you wrote code to calculate the surface area. How many definitions did you use? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4 or 7}}

@n How does the surface area that the computer returns compare to the surface area you calculated by hand?
