@n What do you picture in your mind when you hear _rectangular prism_?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a box}}

@n What do you picture in your mind when you hear _surface area_?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the area of the faces on the outside of a shape}}

@fitb{}{}

*Open the @starter-file{prism} and click "Run".* +
*Type `prism` into the Interactions Area (on the right) and hit "enter" to see an image of a rectangular prism.*

@n How many faces does this prism have? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{6}}

== Defining Faces

*Find PART 1 in the Definitions Area of the starter file (on the left). You will see a definition for `front` and `back`.*

@n How did the author know to use width and height as the dimensions for `front`? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{That's how the sides of `front` are labelled on the prism.}}

@n Why are `front` and `back` defined to be the same thing?@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In a rectangular prism, parallel faces are identical.}}

@n Using these definitions as a model, add definitions for the other faces of this prism to the Definitions Area (on the left).

== Completing the List

*Find PART 2 in the starter file. You'll see @show{(code '(list front back))}... so far the list only includes `front` and `back`.*

@n Complete the faces list, then type @show{(code '(print-imgs faces))} into the Interactions Area. What do you see?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{all six faces of the prism appear}}

@fitb{}{}

==Printing Your Paper Model

*We're going to print the faces following directions in PART 3 and build a paper model of a rectangular prism.*

_Before you print and build your prism, you can change the length, width, and height of your prism at the top of the starter file. Be sure that all 3 dimensions are different, and that they are all small enough to fit on a sheet of paper. If you change them, record your new dimensions here._

@hspace{2em} LENGTH: @fitb{10em}{} WIDTH: @fitb{10em}{} HEIGHT: @fitb{10em}{}

//@n What units are the dimensions of the prism given in? @fitb{}{}

//@n What units should the surface area be given in? @fitb{}{}

@n Calculate the surface area of your prism, by adding the area of each face. @fitb{20ex}{} Show your work below.

== Code for Calculating the Surface Area of a Prism

*Follow the directions in PART 4 of the starter file to write code to calculate the surface area.*

@n How many definitions did you write? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4 or 7 (3 or 6 for faces, plus one for SA)}}

@n How does the surface area that the computer returns compare to the surface area you calculated by hand?
