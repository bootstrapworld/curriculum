| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement


| My Program Submission
| Running my code produces no errors. In Part 1, I correctly defined all six faces of a rectangular prism. In Part 2, I correctly coded the list of faces. In Part 3, I wrote definitions that calculate the area of each face. In Part 4, I wrote code that correctly computes surface area.
| Running my code produces no errors. There is a small error in one or two of the sections of my Definitions Area.
| Running my code produces errors. There area errors in three or more of the sections of my Definitions Area.


| My Rectangular Prism
| The rectangular prism that I constructed looks like a rectangular prism! On each face, I've written its area with correct units.
| The rectangular prism that I constructed looks a lot like a rectangular prism. On each face, I've written its area (but I may have made one or two mistakes).
| I failed to cut out the faces of my rectangular prism and tape them together / the faces of my rectangular prism do not fit together because of errors in my program.


| Surface Area Practice

| I've completed each of the practice problems, being sure to show my work and provide correct units. I gave an incorrect response for no more than one problem.
| I completed each of the practice problems, but my work is incomplete and I may have forgotten to provide correct units. I gave an incorrect response for two or three problems.
| I skipped problems, or my work is extremely difficult to decipher. I have not provided units. I provided incorrect responses for four or five problems.
