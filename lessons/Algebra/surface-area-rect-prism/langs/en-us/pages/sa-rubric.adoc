| &#9744; Wow!
| &#9744; Getting There
| &#9744; Needs Improvement


| My Program Submission
| Running my code produces no error messages. In Part 1, I correctly defined all six faces of a rectangular prism. In Part 2, I correctly coded the list of faces. In Part 3, I wrote definitions that calculate the area of each face. In Part 4, I wrote code that correctly computes surface area of the entire prism.
| Running my code produces one error message.
| Running my code produces multiple error messages.


| My Rectangular Prism
| My construction looks exactly like a rectangular prism. On each face, I've written its area with correct units.
| My construction looks a lot like a rectangular prism. One or two faces have the wrong area or do not use the correct units.
| My construction does not look like a rectangular prism. One or more faces are the wrong size because of mistakes in my program.


| Surface Area Practice

| I've completed each of the practice problems, showing my work and providing the correct units. I gave an incorrect response for no more than one problem.
| I completed each of the practice problems, but did not show all of my work and/or I have not used the correct units. I gave an incorrect response for two or three problems.
| I skipped problems, or did not show my work so that others could read it. I have not provided units. I provided incorrect responses for four or five problems.
