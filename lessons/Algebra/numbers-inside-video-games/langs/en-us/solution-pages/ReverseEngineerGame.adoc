|What Changes About It?
|More Specifically... what variable(s) are being tracked?

|_Dog_ 				| _Position_ 		| _x-coordinate_
|Cloud 				| Position 			| x-coordinate (& y-coordinate)
|Ruby 				| Position 			| x-coordinate (& y-coordinate)
|NinjaCat			| Position			| x-coordinate & y-coordinate
|Score 				| Value 			| Number
3+<| _Note:_

* _While only the x-coordinates of the Cloud and Ruby change as they move from right to left across the screen, some students might notice that the vertical position where they enter the screen is changing randomly each time they reappear._
* _All students should notice that both the x and y-coordinates of NinjaCat are changing, since the player is in control of both vertical and horizontal motion._
