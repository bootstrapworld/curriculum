= ðŸŽ® The Numbers Inside Video Games

@description{Students play a simple video game, identifying which components are constant, which are variables, and how they change. They discuss their favorite games and think about the work involved in making them.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

- Identify the objects in a video game that are changing.
- Use math language to describe what is changing about each object.
- Understand the time, money, and resources it takes to create a popular video game.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
- Let's identify the objects in a video game.
- Let's use math vocabulary to describe what is changing about each game object.
- Let's think about the time, money, and resources it takes to create a popular video game.

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
- Students will need their own Google accounts.
- Take care to manage student expectations about what their game will be like.  Modern games are very complex!

== Reverse Engineering a video game @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students play a simple video game, and gradually break it down into parts. Doing so reveals how @vocab{coordinates} play a crucial role in video games, and how animation is created via equations that govern the changing values of those coordinates.

=== Launch
@teacher{
Play the @starter-file{ninja-cat} onscreen while students watch. Purposely make mistakes while playing the game, which should elicit responses/direction from students.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Take turns playing @starter-file{ninja-cat} in pairs. 
- After you've both had a chance to play, write down what you _notice_ about the game on @printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc}. 
- "Notice"s should be statements, not questions. What stood out to you? What do you remember?
}
 
@teacher{
Crowdsource students' Notices.
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
What do you _wonder_ about the game? What questions do you have about how it works? Write these down on @printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
Crowdsource students' Wonders.
}

@strategy{Pedagogy Note: Notice & Wonder}{

This pedagogy is a @link{https://sadlerscience.com/notice-and-wonder/, widely-used best practice in Math-Ed}, and is used throughout this course. In the "Notice" phase, students are asked to crowd-source their observations. No observation is too small or too silly! By listening to other students' observations, students may find themselves taking a closer look at the game. The "Wonder" phase involves students raising questions, but they must also explain the context for those questions. Sharon Hessney (moderator for the NYTimes excellent @link{https://www.NYtimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's Going On in This Graph?} activity) sometimes calls this "what do you wonder...and *why*?". Sharon recommends the sentence starter "I wonder if ... because ..." This pushes students toward developing new ideas. Wonderings are conditional ideas, which empower students to investigate rather than receive rote knowledge. Both of these phases should be done in groups or as a whole class, with adequate time given to each.

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
Work with your partner to complete @printable-exercise{ReverseEngineerGame.adoc}.

@teacher{
Debrief what changed, what changed about them, and how the changes are modeled mathematically!

@QandA{
@Q{How many numbers does it take to represent a single frame of the video game? +
_Hint: Each character is represented by both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate (some of which are fixed and some of which are randomly generated)._}
@A{Nine: 2 for the cat (moves left and right), 2 each for the cloud and ruby (move left at random y-positions), 2 for the dog (moves left at a fixed y-position) and 1 for the score}
@Q{How are those numbers changing - or _varying_ - as the game plays? When do they increase? Decrease?}
@A{The cat's y-coordinate increases when they jump and decreases when they fall.}
@A{x-coordinates increase when a character moves right, and decrease when they move left.} 
@A{The score increases by 1 when the cat gets a ruby and by 10 when the cat jumps on the dog.}
@Q{How many variables would we need to have a two-player game with two cats?}
@A{(Sample answer) Eleven: we'd need to add another set of x-y coordinates.}
@Q{How many variables would we need if the entire game was in 3D?}
@A{(Sample answer) Fifteen: we'd need to add z-coordinates to each character.}
}

@teacher{
The main idea here is to understand that while we see images on a screen, the computer only sees a small set of variables, which uniquely model the state of the game. The way those numbers change determines how the game behaves, and we can add features to the game if we're willing to keep track of more variables.
}

=== Common Misconceptions
- Students are likely to describe what the character is _doing_, as opposed to _what changes_. For example: "The dog is moving to the left" is not actually describing the property being changed (position, place, location, etc).
- Students may write down what they _hope_ is changeable, as opposed to what actually changes. It's common for students to say the cat's costume is changing, because they assume the cat will somehow "level up" if they get enough points.

@QandA{
@Q{How many variables do you think are being kept track of in a modern video game?}
@A{A whole lot -- Thousands. Millions!}
}

== Connecting to Real Games @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students apply this way of thinking to more complex, real-world games. They also get a sense for how much work is involved in creating games like that.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
What are your favorite video games?
}

@teacher{Make a list of the names of the video games on the board.}

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
Let's choose one current, popular game to discuss.

- How long do you think it took to create that game?
- How _many people_ do you think it takes to create a game like that?
- How _much money_ does it take to create a game like that?
}

@teacher{
Collect students estimates for each of the questions above.
}

@opt{Once students have made their estimates, have students use the Internet to research these questions and compare the actual numbers to their estimates.}

@slidebreak

@ifnotslide{*Answers:*} There's a lot of variability, especially between game consoles and cell phone games! But here are a few sample numbers:

@slidebreak

The 3D, two-player version of NinjaCat needed a lot more numbers than the simple one we played with today, _but the actual concepts at work are the same_.

We don't have time in this course to make games that are as complex as your favorite games, but you'll be learning the same concepts just by making a simpler one.

@teacher{
The goal here is not to discourage students from the possibility of eventually creating a game like their favorite game, but to manage expectations given our limited resources (time, money, and people).  By starting with this game project, students are learning transferable skills that can help them later on in learning new programming languages and creating bigger projects.

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Why won't we be making video games that are as complex as games like Call of Duty in this course?}
@A{They take years to build, even with a huge professional team!}
@Q{What kind of video games are we likely make in this course?}
@A{Fairly basic games with a player, target and danger, like the Ninjacat Game we played at the beginning of today's class.}
