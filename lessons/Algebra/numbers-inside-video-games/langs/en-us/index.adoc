| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:
@objectives

@objective{Identify the objects in a video game that are changing.}
@objective{Use math language to describe what is changing about each object.}
@objective{Understand the time, money, and resources it takes to create a popular video game.}

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
- Let's identify the objects in a video game.
- Let's use math vocabulary to describe what is changing about each game object.
- Let's think about the time, money, and resources it takes to create a popular video game.

| Preparation
|
@preparation{
- Print and cutout @handout{dog-cat-ruby.adoc, the image of the dog}. _Use of the included cat and ruby images is optional_.
}

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
- Students will need their own Google accounts.
- Take care to manage student expectations about what their game will be like.  Modern games are very complex!

== Navigating a Grid

=== Overview
Students play a simple video game, are asked to come up with a way of identifying location on a grid, which provides the justification for coordinates.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch-DN}
@teacher{
Play the @starter-file{ninja-cat} onscreen while students watch. Purposely make mistakes while playing the game, which should elicit responses/direction from students.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Take turns playing @starter-file{ninja-cat} in pairs. 
- After you've both had a chance to play, write down what you _notice_ about the game on @printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc}. 
- "Notice"s should be statements, not questions. What stood out to you? What do you remember?
}
 
@teacher{
Crowdsource students' Notices.
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

@lesson-instruction{
What do you _wonder_ about the game? What questions do you have about how it works? Write these down on @printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
Crowdsource students' Wonders.
}

@strategy{Pedagogy Note: Notice & Wonder}{

This pedagogy is a @link{https://sadlerscience.com/notice-and-wonder/, widely-used best practice in Math-Ed}, and is used throughout this course. In the "Notice" phase, students are asked to crowd-source their observations. No observation is too small or too silly! By listening to other students' observations, students may find themselves taking a closer look at the game. The "Wonder" phase involves students raising questions, but they must also explain the context for those questions. Sharon Hessney (moderator for the NYTimes excellent @link{https://www.NYtimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's Going On in This Graph?} activity) sometimes calls this "what do you wonder...and *why*?". Sharon recommends the sentence starter "I wonder if ... because ..." This pushes students toward developing new ideas. Wonderings are conditional ideas, which empower students to investigate rather than receive rote knowledge. Both of these phases should be done in groups or as a whole class, with adequate time given to each.

@slidebreak{LaunchC}
Computers use numbers to represent a character's position onscreen, using number lines as rulers to measure the distance from the bottom-left corner of the screen.

If we placed the image of a dog on a screen and drew a number line running from 0 (on the left) to 1000 (on the right), it would look like this:

@center{@image{images/1dPosition.png}}

We could then measure the distance back to the left-hand edge. If we shared that number with anyone else who knows about our number line, they would be able to duplicate the exact position of the Dog.

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

@ifslide{@center{@image{images/1dPosition.png}}}

@QandA{
@Q{What is the coordinate of the Dog, if it's on the left-hand edge of the screen?}
@A{The Dog's coordinate would be zero.}
@Q{What is the coordinate of the Dog, if it's on the right-hand edge of the screen?}
@A{The Dog's coordinate would be 1000.}
@Q{What is the coordinate of the Dog, if it's in the center of the screen?}
@A{The Dog's coordinate would be 500.}
@Q{What coordinate would place the Dog beyond the left-hand edge of the screen?}
@A{The Dog's coordinate would be less than zero (negative).}
@Q{What coordinate would place the Dog beyond the right-hand edge of the screen?}
@A{The Dog's coordinate would be greater than 1000.}
}

@opt{Select a volunteer to leave the room for a moment. Place the printed Dog image somewhere on the number line you've drawn on the board, and have the class quietly choose the number that represents the Dog's location. Remove the Dog and invite the student back into the room. Can they position the Dog at the right place, based on the number chosen by the class?}

@slidebreak{LaunchC}

@ifslide{@center{@image{images/1dPosition.png}}}

This number line lets us communicate the position of the Dog using a single number! Unfortunately, it only represents the distance from the left-hand edge of the screen. That means the dog could be at any _height_ in the center of the screen, and it would always have the same number to represent its position.

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/2dPosition.png}}}
By adding a second number line, we can locate a character _anywhere_ on the screen in either direction.

- The first line we drew runs from left to right and is called the @vocab{x-axis}.
- The second line, which runs up and down, is called the @vocab{y-axis}.

A 2-dimensional @vocab{coordinate} consists of both the x- and y-locations on the axes.

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@right{@image{images/2dPosition.png}}
Suppose we wanted to locate NinjaCatâ€™s position on the screen. We can find the x-coordinate by dropping a line down from NinjaCat and read the position on the number line, then find the y-coordinate by running a line to the y-axis.

A coordinate pair is always written in the form of (x, y) with the x before the y (just like in the alphabet!).

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/2dPosition.png}}}
The coordinate pair @math{(200, 50)}, for example, indicates that the x-coordinate is 200 and the y-coordinate is 50.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
To develop an intuition for coordinates, complete @printable-exercise{Estimation.adoc}.

=== Common Misconceptions

Math-phobic students often fail to realize that _common sense_ and _intuition_ can be helpful in exercises where the answer is a number! The first two prompts in the "Synthesize" section directly get at this misconception, but you may want to pay special attention to those students while they are working.

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

@QandA{
@Q{Should any of the characters have x-coordinates that are very similar? How come?}
@A{Ninja Cat and the cloud have similar x-coordinates. They have the same horizontal position.}
@Q{Should any of the characters have y-coordinates that are very similar? How come?}
@A{The Ruby and the Dog have similar y-coordinates. They have the same vertical position.}
@Q{How do you think this concept relates to a video game?}
@A{Answers vary: we need to know where characters are on the screen, we need a way for players to interact with certain parts of the screen, etc.}
