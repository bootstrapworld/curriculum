= Exploring Compound Inequality

This page is designed to accompany @starter-file{inequalities-compound}. When you click "Run" you will see 4 graphs. The first two are simple inequalities and the second two are compound inequalities.

@n What does `and-intersection` do?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It takes in 2 functions and a list of numbers, producing a graph of the shaded intersection of values that make both of the inequalities true.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Why is the circle on 5 red and the circle on 15 green?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because 5 is not part of the solution - it's not bigger than itself. And 15 is part of the solution - it's less than or equal to 15.}}

@n Do you think every graph made with `and-intersection` will have different color dots at the ends? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. It will depend on whether or not the inequality symbols include an equal sign. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sometimes one will and one won't. Sometimes neither will. Sometimes both will.}}

@n What does `or-union` do?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It takes in two functions and a list of numbers, producing a graph showing the shaded union of values that...}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{make either or both of the inequalities true.}}

@n Why did the graph of this `or-union` result in the whole numberline being shaded blue?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because in order to make an `or` statement true, a number only has to make one of the inequalities true.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Every number in the universe is either greater than 5 or less than or equal to 15. There aren't any non-solutions!}}

@n Not all graphs of `or-union` will look like this. Can you think of a pair of inequalities whose union won't shade the whole graph?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Answers will vary! @math{x \lt 1} *or* @math{x \lt 3}_}}

@vspace{1ex}

Change the function definition on _line 8_ to @math{x \lt 5} and the definition on _line 9_ to @math{x \ge 15} and, before you click "Run", take a moment to think about what the new graphs of `and-intersection` and `or-union` will look like. Then click "Run" and take a look.

@n What does the new `and-intersection` graph look like?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It only has red circles, representing non-solutions, as below. None of the graph is shaded because there aren't any numbers...}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{that are both smaller than 5 and greater than or equal to 15. A message tells us that no solutions exist in the provided range.}}

@n What does the new `or-union` graph look like?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There's an arrow to the left and an arrow to the right with a break in the middle between 5 and 15!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The dot for 5 is red because it's not part of the solution. The dot for 15 is green because it's part of the solution.}}

@n Why is the dot for 5 red and the dot for 15 green?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The dot for 5 is red because it's not part of the solution. The dot for 15 is green because it's part of the solution.}}

@n Which of the 8 numbers from the list are part of the solution set? How do you know?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{-5, -2.1, 0, 15, 20... the circles are green.}}

@n Is 3 part of the solution set? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. It's in the blue shaded region.}}

@n Is 10 part of the solution set? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. It's in the unshaded area.}
