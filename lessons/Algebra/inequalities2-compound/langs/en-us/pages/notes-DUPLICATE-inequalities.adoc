*Sometimes we want to _ask questions_ about data:*

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
- Is `x` greater than `y`? 
- Is one string equal to another? 
}

@vspace{1ex}

These questions are answered with a new data type called a @vocab{Boolean}.

Unlike Numbers, Strings, and Images, Booleans have only two possible values. A Boolean value is either `true` or `false`. 

You already know some functions that produce Booleans, such as `<` and `>`!

@vspace{1ex}

Our programming language has them, too. We can evaluate:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a", frame="none", grid="none", shading="none"]
|===
| @show{(code '(< 3 4))}
| @show{(code '(> 2 10))}
| @show{(code '(= -10 19))}

| "3 is less than 4" is `true`
| "2 is greater than 10" is `false`
| "-10 is equal to 19" is `false`
|===

*We can also ask more complicated questions:*

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
- Is the elephant small enough and light enough to ride in the boat?
- Do we have enough rice and enough time to make it for dinner? 
}

@vspace{2ex}

Our programming language uses the `and` and `or` functions to combine to *_Simple Inequalities_* to make a @vocab{Compound Inequality}.

@vspace{1ex}

[.indentedpara]
--
- The `and` function will return true if *both* sub-expressions are `true`.
- The `or` function will return true if *at least one* sub-expression is `true`.

[cols="^3a, ^3a"]
|===
| @show{(code '(and (> 5 6) (< 7 9)))} 
| @show{(code '(or (> 5 6) (< 7 9)))} 

| "5 is greater than 6 _and_ 7 is less than 9"
| "5 is greater than 6 _or_ 7 is less than 9"

| This will evaluate to `false`, +
because the expressions aren't both `true`.
| This will evaluate to `true`, +
because at least one of the expressions is `true`.
|===

The Circles of Evaluation work the same way with Booleans that they do with Numbers, Strings and Images.

[cols="^3a,^3a"]

| @show{(coe '(and (> 5 6) (< 7 9)))}

Video games use Booleans for many things including: 

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
- asking when a player's health is equal to zero
- determining whether two characters are close enough to bump into one another
- figuring out if a character's coordinates put it off the edge of the screen

}
