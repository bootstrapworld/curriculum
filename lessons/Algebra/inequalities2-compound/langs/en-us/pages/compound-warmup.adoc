@n What 4 numbers are in the solution set of @math{x \gt 5} *and* @math{x \le 15}, making both of these inequalities true?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Possible answers: 5.001, 10, 12.374, 15}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n How would that be different from the solution set of @math{x \gt 5} *or* @math{x \le 15}, making at least one of these inequalities true?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{All real numbers are a part of the solution set for @math{x \gt 5} *or* @math{x \le 15}}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{because there aren’t any numbers that don’t satisfy at least one of these expressions.}}
