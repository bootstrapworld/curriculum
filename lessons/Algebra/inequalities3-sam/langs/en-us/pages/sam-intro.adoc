@n What do you see when Sam is at (0,0)?  Why is that?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sam is at the center of the screen, because the origin is at the middle}}

@n What changes as the butterfly moves left and right?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Sam's x-coordinate_}}

@n Sam is in a 640 × 480 yard. Sam’s mom wants Sam to stay in sight... __How far to the left and right can Sam go and still remain visible?__

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sam can go to the left until their x-coordinate is less than -40, and to the right until x > 680}}
