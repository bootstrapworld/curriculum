For hundreds of years before the Spanish began to settle in Central America, human sacrifice in Maya culture was a ritual offering to “feed” their gods.  Blood was viewed as a powerful way to nourish the Maya gods, and the sacrifice of a human life was the most dramatic way to do this. The most important Maya rituals ended in human sacrifice. Generally only highly respected prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lowly captives being used for labour.
Human sacrifice among the Maya is evident from at least the Classic period (AD 250–900) right through to the final stages of the Spanish conquest in the 1600s. These rituals are depicted in Classic Maya art, are mentioned in Classic period hieroglyphic texts and have been confirmed archaeologically by analysis of skeletal remains from the years AD 900 to1524. Additionally, human sacrifice is described in a number of late Maya and early Spanish colonial texts, including the Madrid Codex and Diego de Landa’s Relación de las cosas de Yucatán.
