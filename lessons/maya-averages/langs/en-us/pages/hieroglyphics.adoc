Maya hieroglyphics can also provide insight into human sacrifices.

The image on the left is an example of a hieroglyph that portrays sacrifice of an unidentified male.

Researchers have carefully catalogued all the images of sacrifice they could find in ancient Maya hieroglyphics.

*In these images, many of those being sacrificed were portrayed as Maya Gods!*

The pie chart below displays the different gods depicted in ritual sacrifices.

Does the information in this pie chart provide any new ideas as to why the Maya civilization may have declined between years 900-1000?
