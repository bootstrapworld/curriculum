= Finding the Average

Data scientists often want to report the _typical_ value of a quantitative dataset, as a way of summarizing all the values.

Data scientists have several precise ways of reporting what’s typical. One way is to compute the @vocab{average} (or mean). The average is calculated by adding all the numbers in a dataset and dividing by how many there are.

Example on Computing Averages:

Calculate the average female student head circumference using your group’s dataset.

[cols="^1a, ^1a, ^1a", options="header"]
|===
| Total inches  	| Number of females in group | @math{total \div number}
|	@vspace{3ex}	|							|

Calculate the average male student head circumference using your group’s dataset.

[cols="^1a, ^1a, ^1a", options="header"]
|===
| Total inches  	| Number of males in group | @math{total \div number}
|	@vspace{3ex}	|							|
|===

Calculating Averages in Google Sheets
In an empty cell (below the dataset), type =average(
Highlight the dataset that you want to find the average of and then type ) to complete the “formula”
Click Enter. Your average should be calculated.


Going back to our original dataset from yesterday, is it possible, based on the average, to determine the sex of the children's skulls that were marked unsure? Why or why not?
