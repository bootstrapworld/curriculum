@description{In today’s lesson, students will wrap up their work with skull data from the Maya human sacrifice victims from Lesson 2 and realize that it is problematic to display quantitative variables (e.g. skull circumference) in a pie chart. In order to draw additional conclusions from the skull evidence, students will learn to display quantitative variables using a histogram. Students will then use data from Maya human sacrifice victims to make claims that are supported by the data. In the quest to answer the question about how the Maya civilization ended, students will transition to looking at a display that shows counts of various Maya gods depicted in sacrifice images. By the end of class, students will confirm that most sacrifice victims were adult males and that the corn god played a very significant role in Maya society.

== Calculating Averages

=== Overview

Students will examine data on skull circumferences of modern-day New York City fourth graders and consider whether the data could be used to clarify whether the child skull data they saw yesterday could be sorted by sex.

=== Launch

We’ve learned that:

* While small, the datasets we are looking at are fairly representative of the data archaeologist have collected about ancient Maya sacrifice practices
* More often than not, the ancient Maya sacrificed adult men.

Let's start with completing @printable-exercise{pie-chart-review.adoc}, using the pie charts from homework.

[cols="^1a,^1a"]

| @image{images/age-sacrificed.png, "pie chart: 10% unsure, 20% child, 70% adult" }
| @image{images/sex-of-sacrificed.png, "pie chart: 55% male, 5% female, 40% unsure"}
|===

=== Investigate

I want to point us to an observation I made:

* Our data distinguishes female and male adults, but not boys and girls.
* For every skull marked “child” in the age group column, the sex is “unsure”.
* Is this coincidence, or an error in our data?

How can we learn more about the individual child skulls? Data scientists look carefully at their data set to check that it makes sense. If they see something odd about their data, they check whether the data values are accurate. Sometimes, we use the information we’re sure about, from known individuals, to learn more about unknown individuals. Today we are going to use a dataset from students in a fourth grade classroom in New York City to see if there is a difference in male and female skulls in children today! This may help us see if we were right to call them “unsure”.

[.lesson-instruction]
If we had a table filled with head circumference measurements, would it make sense to put this data into a pie chart? Why or why not?

Pie charts provide a visual summary of categorical data, like sex. For quantitative data, we can summarize the data in another way by using something known as averages.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Imagine that there were three hungry friends. One person got 3 crackers, another person got 8 crackers, and the third person got 10 crackers. They decide that it isn't fair to share them that way.

* What would be a way to make sure everyone got the same number of crackers?
**  _We would have to collect them all, count them up, and divide them by the number of people. The number we'd get is called an @vocab{average}._
--

. In total, there are 21 crackers: @math{3 + 8 + 10 = 21}
. And 3 friends to share them between: @math{21 \div 3 = 7}
. The average of @math{3, 8, and 10} is @math{7}.

Work with your partner to complete @printable-exercise{youth-skulls.adoc}, finding the average head circumference for the boys and the girls in each group in Ms. Trementozzi's class.

=== Synthesize

* Could we use the average skull sizes you calculated to determine whether or not the unsure skulls are male or female?
** _No._
** _The averages for male and female skulls are too similar._
** Measuring a few skulls from one classroom in New York City can’t give us an average that we can widely apply.  We need a larger sample size to draw conclusions.

== Calculating Averages in Google Sheets

=== Overview

Students will learn how to calculate averages in Google Sheets using a copy of a ready to work with data set.

=== Launch
The more data we have about something, the more reliable our average becomes and Google Sheets will allow us to easily calculate averages for larger data sets!

Make a copy of @starter-file{averages} and project it on the board.

Talk students through how you would calculate the average skull size for female children.

2) Highlight the dataset that you want to find the average of and then type ) to complete the “formula”

3) Click Enter. Your average should be calculated.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
* Make a copy of @starter-file{averages}.
* Calculate the average skull size for female children and then for male children.

=== Synthesize

We have a new tool in our toolkits!

Besides finding averages, what else do we know how to do in Google Sheets?

- _Sort data._
- _Make pie charts._

== What else can we learn about the ancient Maya?

=== Overview

Students will read research findings revealing that many of those sacrificed in ancient Maya ceremonies were highly respected prisoners of war. They will think about how their data supports or denies this claim. Then they will look at a pie chart showing Gods portrayed in hieroglyphic depictions of sacrifices.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{what-else.adoc} and @printable-exercise{what-else-cont.adoc} with your partner.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students complete @printable-exercise{hieroglyphics.adoc}

=== Synthesize

Most victims of human sacrifice seemed to be highly respected prisoners of war.

- Why do you think that the ancient Maya sacrificed those that were highly respected?
- How does this differ from what you originally thought?
- How could this explain why there is jewelry in the caves?!

Have students write responses to the following questions on the @opt-printable-exercise{journal.adoc}:

- What did we learn about the ancient Maya today?
- Has your thinking changed at all about why the Maya population declined?
- What evidence did we examine?
- What data science skills did we learn?
