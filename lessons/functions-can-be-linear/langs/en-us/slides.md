# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

Complete Part 2 of @printable-exercise{notice-wonder-linearity.adoc} and consider the questions about these two data tables.

Can you figure out what the next (x,y) pair should be for each of them?{style="font-size:16pt"}  

Can you guess what the y-value for each table would be when x is 0?{style="font-size:16pt"}

<!--
_Be sure that students have noticed that:_

- _each (x,y) pair on the table corresponds to a point on the graph_
- _both the x and y values in the table are increasing by consistent intervals_
- _the points on the graph are connected by a straight line_

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

We can think of the "x" column as counting the __order in which the y-values appear__ (1st value, 2nd value, etc). When we notice that x-values change at a _constant rate_ and the y-values also change at a _constant rate_, we know that if we were to plot those values on a graph, all of the points would fall on a straight line.

*Linear Relationships* are sequences that change at a constant rate, or points forming a straight line on a graph.

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

*Linear Relationships* are sequences that change at a constant rate, or points forming a straight line on a graph.

The line representing the @vocab{linear} relationship would not only include the points represented in the table, but also **all of the coordinate pairs that satisfy the same rule**, including lots of points whose x and y values are fractions and decimals.

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

**Axes on a graph need an order. Rows in a table don't!**

The points in a table are _discrete_. While ordering the rows in a table can make it easier for us to find the function,
they preserve their meaning if the rows are shuffled into a different order.

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

**Axes on a graph need an order. Rows in a table don't!**

On a graph, the points on the x-axis _cannot_ be shuffled, because the x-axis must always be ordered. 

We can stretch the _scale_ of the axes to making the lines _look_ different, but the points will always be in the same order.

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

We've seen that linear relationships can be represented as tables and graphs. 

Tables only show us _some points_ on a line, whereas a line itself is made up of an _infinite_ number of points. 

While a table represents a _sample_ of some larger trend, the graph is a way of seeing the trend itself.

# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

@image{images/set-of-6-tables.png}

Linear relationships in a table show up as sequences that change at a constant rate. 

Three of the tables show linear relationships, and three show non-linear relationships.

{layout="LaunchC"}
# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

@image{images/set-of-6-tables.png}

The linear tables can have y-values that change by zero (no change), by a positive number (constant increase), or a negative number (constant decrease). 

The other tables may show patterns, but they arenâ€™t linear!

# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

Sometimes there is _no function_ that will give us a particular table or graph! Take a look at the table and points below. Can you predict the next two rows? Where will the next point be?

# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

Data has a "shape", and this shape can emerge when we look for patterns in that data. A @vocab{linear} function is one kind of pattern, and we can see it when viewing data as a table or a graph.

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

Every linear relationship has two properties:

1) The sequence of y-values always changes at a constant rate - called @vocab{slope} - increasing or decreasing by the same amount for each change in the x-value.

2) The y-value when @math{x = 0} is called the @vocab{y-intercept}.

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@table{7}
| x | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
| y | -1 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9

Turn to @printable-exercise{slope-int-tables-intro.adoc}

- In the table below: How much does y increase as x increases by 1? (This is the *slope*.) 
- What is the y-intercept? (Figure this out by finding the y-value when @math{x = 0}.)

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@table{7}
| x | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
| y | -1 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9

Life isn't always so simple!

- What if the table didn't include x = 0?
- What if the x-values didn't increase by 1?
- What if the other rows were __out of order__?
- What if we only had a few random rows, for @math{x = 3} and @math{x = 1}?

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@table{5}
| x |  2 | 5 | 8  | 11
| y |  3 | 9 | 15 | 21

Try extending the second table (above) and filling in the missing rows to find the slope and y-intercept.

What strategies did you use to extend the table?

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

You can find the y-intercept by expanding the table and following the pattern to figure out the value of @math{y} when @math{x = 0}, but sometimes that's a lot of work! How might we compute the slope and y-intercept, using only two rows in the table?

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

TO FIND THE SLOPE: Find any two pairs of values in the table, and divide the difference in y's by the difference in x's.

This is an easy way to see the change in y __as a proportion__ of the change in x, which gives you the @vocab{slope} of the function.

This is often described as  @math{\frac{ChangeInY}{ChangeInX}} or @math{\frac{rise}{run}}.

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@table{6}
| x | 3 | 20 | 5  |  9 | 1
| y | 5 | 56 | 11 | 23 | -1

Taking the first two pairs of values gives us @math{\frac{(56 - 5)}{(20 - 3)}}, which simplifies to @math{\frac{51}{17}}, for a slope of @math{3}.

* Pick two other pairs of values from the third table and compute the @vocab{slope}. Did you get the same answer?
* Are there other strategies we could have used to find the slope?

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

Let's get some practice identifying the slope of a linear function in a table by completing @printable-exercise{slope-and-y-tables.adoc}

---
{layout="Synthesize"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@vocab{Slope} and @vocab{y-intercept} form the essence of linear functions. If we can find them in a sample of data, we can make predictions that go outside that sample. 

For example: If we know a car is moving at a consistent speed, all we need to know is __where it is located at two points in time__ in order to figure out the speed, and to predict where it will be at any other point in time!

On a graph, the y-intercept is the value where the line "intercepts" the y-axis.

On a graph, the slope refers to both the "steepness" and "direction" of the line.

We have learned how to find @vocab{slope} and @vocab{y-intercept} from tables and graphs of linear relationships. Check in with yourself and what we've learned today.

* Which representation do you feel more confident finding the slope from? Why?
* Which representation do you feel more confident finding the y-intercept from? Why?
Looking ahead, we will be learning about yet another representation of Linear Functions that you might find to be even more flexible and powerful.

Linear relationships are _everywhere_:

* "As the number of people visiting the amusement park goes up, the time we spend waiting in line tends to go up."
* "The more we drive, the more gas we tend to use."
* "The more Carlo babysits, the more money he tends to earn."
* "As the number of lizards in the house goes up, the number of cockroaches in the house tends to go down."

What other linear relationships can you think of?
