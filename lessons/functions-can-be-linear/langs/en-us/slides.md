# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

Can you predict the next two rows in the table? The next points on the graph? How did you arrive at your prediction?

{layout="Launch"}
# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

The y-column in the table and the y-coordinates on the graph follow a _rule_, which dictates how @math{y} relates to @math{x}. When @math{x} goes up or down by 1, @math{y} goes up or down by 2. We expect that rule to continue for all values of @math{x}, continuing the line and extending the table in both directions, forever.

*Linear Relationships* are sequences that change at a constant rate, or points forming a straight line on a graph.

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

Linear relationships are _everywhere_:

* "A car is traveling at 50 miles per hour"
* "Milk costs $2.50 per gallon"
* "There are 18 wheels on every tractor-trailer"
* "A tree grows 2 inches each year"
* "There are 30 students per teacher"

What other linear relationships can you think of?

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? 

Can you figure out what the next (x,y) pair should be for each of them? 

Can you guess what the y-value for each table would be when x is 0?

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

Axes on a graph need an order. Rows in a table don’t!

The rows in a table are discrete. They preserve their meaning if the rows are shuffled into a different order.

In a graph, the points on the x-axis cannot be shuffled, because the x-axis must always be ordered. We can stretch the scale of the axes to making the lines look different, but the points will always be in the same order.

# Simple Sequences and Straight Lines

Linear relationships show up all the time in real life, so it’s helpful to know how to think about them. 

Linear relationships can be represented as tables and graphs. 
- Tables only show us some points on a line, whereas a line itself is made up of an infinite number of points. 
- While a table represents a sample of some larger trend, the graph is a way of seeing the trend itself.

# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

Linear relationships in a graph always appear as straight lines.

Three of the graphs on the previous slide represent @vocab{linear} relationships, and three show other, non-linear relationships. The linear graphs can go in lots of directions and non-linear relationships can follow patterns that aren't linear!

# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

Linear relationships in a table show up as sequences that change at a constant rate. The y-value when x is zero is also the value where the line will cross the y-axis.

Three of the tables on the previous slide show linear relationships, and three show other, non-linear relationships. The linear tables can have y-values that change by zero (no change), by a positive number (constant increase), or a negative number (constant decrease) as the x-values increase. While the other tables may show patterns, they aren’t linear!

# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

Sometimes there is no function that will give us a particular table or graph! Take a look at the table and points below. Can you predict the next two rows? Where will the next point be?

# Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!

Data has a "shape", and this shape can emerge when we look for patterns in that data. A @vocab{linear} function is one kind of pattern, and we can see it when viewing data as a table or a graph.

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

Every linear relationship has two properties:

1) The sequence of y-values always changes at a constant rate - called @vocab{slope} - increasing or decreasing by the same amount for each change in the x-value.

2) The y-value when @math{x = 0} is called the @vocab{y-intercept}.

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@table{7}
| x | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
| y | -1 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9

Turn to @printable-exercise{slope-int-tables-intro.adoc}

- In the table below: How much does y increase as x increases by 1? 
- What is the y-intercept? (Figure this out by finding the y-value when @math{x = 0}.)

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@table{7}
| x | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
| y | -1 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9

Life isn't always so simple!

- What if the table didn't include x = 0?
- What if the x-values didn't increase by 1?
- What if the other rows were __out of order__?
- What if we only had a few random rows, for @math{x = 3} and @math{x = 1}?

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables


Try extending the second table (below) and filling in the missing rows to find the slope and y-intercept.

@table{5}
| x |  2 | 5 | 8  | 11
| y |  3 | 9 | 15 | 21

What strategies did you use to extend the table?

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

You can find the y-intercept by expanding the table and following the pattern to figure out the value of @math{y} when @math{x = 0}, but sometimes that's a lot of work! How might we compute the slope and y-intercept, using only two rows in the table?

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

TO FIND THE SLOPE: Find any two pairs of values in the table, and divide the difference in y's by the difference in x's.

This is an easy way to see the change in y __as a proportion__ of the change in x, which gives you the @vocab{slope} of the function.

This is often described as  @math{\frac{change.in.y}{change.in.x}} or @math{\frac{rise}{run}}.


---
{layout="Launch"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@table{6}
| x | 3 | 20 | 5  |  9 | 1
| y | 5 | 56 | 11 | 23 | -1

Taking the first two pairs of values gives us @math{\frac{56 - 5}{20 - 3}}, which simplifies to @math{\frac{51}{17}}, for a slope of @math{3}.

* Pick two other pairs of values from the third table and compute the @vocab{slope}. Did you get the same answer?
* Are there other strategies we could have used to find the slope?

---
{layout="Launch"}
# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

TO FIND THE Y-INTERCEPT: Multiply any x in the table by the slope, and subtract the result from the corresponding y.

Let's use the the pair (20, 56) from the table to demonstrate this shortcut:

Starting with the @math{x} value of 20, multiplying by the slope (@math{20 \times 3}) gives us @math{60}.

Looking at the table... when @math{x} is 20, @math{y} is 56.

The y-intercept is @math{56 - 60 = -4}.

Let's get some practice identifying the slope and y-intercept of a linear function in a table by completing @printable-exercise{slope-and-y-tables.adoc}

# Slope and y-Intercept from Tables

@vocab{Slope} and @vocab{y-intercept} form the essence of linear functions. If we can find them in a sample of data, we can make predictions that go outside that sample. 

For example: If we know a car is moving at a consistent speed, all we need to know is __where it is located at two points in time__ in order to figure out the speed, and to predict where it will be at any other point in time!

{layout="LaunchC"}
# Slope and Y-Intercept from Graphs

On a graph, the y-intercept is the value where the line "intercepts" the y-axis.

# Slope and Y-Intercept from Graphs

On a graph, the slope refers to both the "steepness" and "direction" of the line.

# Slope and Y-Intercept from Graphs

We can compute the slope from a graph the same way we would with a table, by picking two points and using those as our two sample rows.
