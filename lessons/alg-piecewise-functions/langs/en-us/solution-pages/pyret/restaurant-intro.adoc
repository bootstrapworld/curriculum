= Welcome to Alice’s Restaurant!

Alice has hired you to improve some code used at the restaurant.
The code we need to work on is shown below.

*Read through the code line-by-line with your partner before writing down your
observations in the tables below.*

----
cost :: String -> Number
# given a menu-item, produce the cost of that menu-item
fun​ cost(menu-item):
  ask:
    | string-equal(menu-item, "hamburger") then:​ 6.00
    | string-equal(menu-item, "onion rings") then:​ 3.50
    | string-equal(menu-item, "fried tofu") then:​ 5.25
    | string-equal(menu-item, "pie") then: 2.25
    | otherwise: "Sorry, that’s not on the menu!"
  end
end

1) *I notice...*

__(sample responses)
a function called ‘cost’, pipes (`\|` symbols), a function called ‘string-equal’, numbers that look like prices, a contract and purpose statement, food items__
--
|2) *I wonder...*

__​(sample responses) What is ‘ask’? Is this all that’s on the menu? Can I add more food? How does the ‘cost’ function work? What are the pipes (`\|`) for? What does ‘string-equal’ do?__

|3) *Familiar things I see in the code*

__define, contract and purpose statement, Numbers and Strings
functions__

|4) *Unfamiliar things I see in the code*

__ask, string-equal, \|-symbol, otherwise__
