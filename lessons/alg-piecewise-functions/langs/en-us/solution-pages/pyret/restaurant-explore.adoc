Alice's code has some new elements we haven't seen before, so let's experiment a bit to figure out how it works!  *Open the “Alice's Restaurant starter file, click “Run”, and try using the `cost` function in the Interactions window.*

@vspace{2ex}

1) What does `cost("hamburger")` evaluate to? @fitb{30ex}{_6_}

@vspace{1ex}

2) What does `cost("pie")` evaluate to? @fitb{30ex}{_2.25_}

@vspace{1ex}

3) What if you ask for `cost("fries")`? @fitb{30ex}{___"Sorry, that's not on the menu!"___}

4) Explain what the function is doing in your own words.

5) What is the function's name? @fitb{22ex}{cost} Domain? @fitb{22ex}{String} Range? @fitb{22ex}{Numner}

@vspace{1ex}

6) What is the name of its variable? @fitb{30ex}{menu-item}

@vspace{1ex}

7) Alice says onion rings have gone up to $3.75. Change the `cost` function to reflect this.

8) Try adding toppings of your own. What's your favorite?

9) For an unknown food item, the function produces a String
( `"That's not on the menu!"`)

Is this a problem? Why or why not?
