= Welcome to Alice’s Restaurant!

Alice has hired you to improve some code used at the restaurant. The code we'll be improving on is shown below.

*Read through the code line-by-line with your partner before writing down your
observations in the tables below.*

----
; cost : String -> Number
; given a menu-item, produce the cost of that menu-item
(define (cost menu-item)
  (cond
    [(string=? menu-item "hamburger")     6.00]
    [(string=? menu-item "onion rings")   3.50]
    [(string=? menu-item "fried tofu")    5.25]
    [(string=? menu-item "pie")           2.25]
    [else "Sorry, that's not on the menu!"]))

*I notice...*

__(sample responses)
a function called ‘cost’, brackets, a function called ‘string=?’, numbers that look like prices, a contract and purpose statement, pizza toppings__
--
| *I wonder...*

​__(sample responses) What is ‘cond’? Is this all that’s on the menu? Can I add different toppings? How does the ‘cost’ function work? What are the brackets for? What does ‘string=?’ do?__

| *Familiar things I see in the code*

__define, contract and purpose statement, Numbers and Strings, functions__

| *Unfamiliar things I see in the code*

__cond, string=?, [], else__
