# Introducing Compound Inequalities

We use inequalities for lots of things:

- Is it hot out? (@math{temperature \gt 80°})
- Did I get paid enough for painting that fence? (@math{paid \ge $100})
- Are the cookies finished baking? (@math{timer = 0})

What other examples can you come up with?

# Introducing Compound Inequalities

Many times we need to _combine_ inequalities:

- Should I go to the beach? (@math{temperature \gt 80°} and @math{weather = "sunny"})
- Was this burrito worth the price? (@math{taste = "delicious"} and @math{price \leq $15})

What other examples can you come up with?

<!--
Guide students through other examples of `and` and `or` with various statements, such as "I'm wearing a red shirt AND I'm a math teacher, true or false?" or "I'm an NBA basketball star OR I'm having pizza for lunch, true or false?". This can make for a good sit-down, stand-up activity, where students take turns saying compound boolean statements and everyone stands if that statement is true for them.

# Introducing Compound Inequalities

Both mathematics and programming have ways of combining - or _composing_ - inequalities.

# Introducing Compound Inequalities

Expressions using `and` only produce `true` if both of their sub-expressions are `true`.
Expressions using `or` produce `true` if *either* of their sub-expressions are `true`.

True or False?
- I'm wearing a red shirt and I'm a math teacher.
- I'm an NBA basketball star or I'm having pizza for lunch.

Write your own compound boolean statements.

<!--
When describing compound inequalities, be careful not to use "english shortcuts". For example, we might say "I am holding a marker _and_ an eraser" instead of "I am holding a marker _and_ I am holding an eraser." These sentences mean the same thing, but the first one obscures the fact that "and" joins two complete phrases. For ELL/ESL students, this is unecessarily adds to cognitive load!

# Solutions and Non-Solutions of Compound Inequalities {style="font-size:22pt"}

Identify 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions for each of the following inequalities.

* @math{x \gt 5}
* @math{x \le 15}

What about the solution set of @math{x \gt 5} `and` @math{x \le 15}?  What numbers make both of these inequality expressions true?

How would that be different from @math{x \gt 5} `or` @math{x \le 15}?  What numbers make at least one of these inequality expressions true?

Open @starter-file{inequalities-compound}.

Read the code and click run to see the graphs you've just considered.

This starter file includes two special functions...

`and-intersection` takes in two functions and a list of numbers and produces a graph with the points and the shaded @vocab{intersection} of values that make both inequalities true. {style="font-size:13pt"}

@show{ (code '(define (gt5 x) (> x 5))) }{style="font-size:13pt"}

@show{ (code '(define (lte15 x) (<= x 15))) }{style="font-size:13pt"}

@show{ (code '(and-intersection gt5 lte15 (list -5 -2.1 0 5 10 39/5 15 20))) }{style="font-size:13pt"}

Some pairs of inequalities do not intersect at all and therefore have no solutions.{style="font-size:15pt"}

`or-union` takes in two functions and a list of numbers and produces a graph with the points and the shaded @vocab{union} of values that make either or both of the inequalities true.{style="font-size:13pt"}

@show{ (code '(define (lt5 x) (< x 5))) }{style="font-size:13pt"}

Some @vocab{unions}, like the one below, include *all real numbers*; they have *infinite solutions* that satisfy at least one of the inequalities.{style="font-size:14pt"}

# Solutions and Non-Solutions of Compound Inequalities {style="font-size:22pt"}

Instead of defining two functions as simple inequalities, we could produce the same graph by defining one function to be a compound inequality.

@show{ (code '(define (fiveto15 x)(and (> x 5) (<= x 15)))) }
@show{ (code '(inequality fiveto15 (list -5 -2.1 0 5 10 12 15 20))) }{style="font-size:16pt"}

Turn to @printable-exercise{compound-inequality-functions.adoc} and write code to describe the compound inequalities pictured.
