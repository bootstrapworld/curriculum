= Displaying Categorical Data

== Displaying Categorical Variables

* With a table open in CODAP, select the "graph" icon to produce a scatterplot of _randomly distributed_ data points.
* Drag attributes/columns to the axes (or select from a drop-down menu of attributes/columns by clicking the axes) to organize the data so that it is no longer randomly distributed.
* Once the data is organized, manipulate it further by selecting the graph menu icons:
	** *the ruler icon* provides options for calculating statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation
	** for _some_ datasets (those with strong correlations), the ruler icon will offer _additional_ statistical computations (such as a least squares line or regression line)
	** the *bar graph icon* allows new configurations of the data. Select this option to group data points into bins or create a bar for each point. Clicking on the bar graph icon a second time (for instance, after data is grouped into bins) allows the creation of a histogram (by fusing the dots into bars).

== Exploring other Displays

@vspace{1ex}

Data Scientists use *displays* to visualize data. You've probably seen some of these charts, graphs and plots yourselves! When it comes to displaying *Categorical Data*, we often rely on *bar charts* and *pie charts*. CODAP, however, only has the capacity to create *bar charts*.

When we want to create a data display in CODAP, it is important to consider the following: Which attributes on which axes? What type of data? What configuration?

*Bar charts* show the _count or percentage_ of rows in each category.

* Bar charts provide a visual representation of the frequency of values in a categorical column. 
* Bar charts have a bar for every category in a column.
* The more rows in a category, the taller the bar.
* Bars in a bar chart can be show in _any order_, without changing the meaning of the chart. However, bars are usually shown in some sensible order (bars for the number of orders for different t-shirt sizes might be presented in order of smallest to largest shirt).
