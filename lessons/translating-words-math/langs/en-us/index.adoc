| Preparation
|
* This activity involves a card sort. The easiest way to prepare for this is to give each pair of students an envelope containing the three sets of cards. Keep each set (A, B, and C) together with rubber bands or paperclips.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* This lesson may challenge students' ideas of math as a subject that is entirely black and white. This theme - that there are oftentimes a variety of completely valid ways of seeing a seemingly simple problem - will emerge again and again throughout the course.

== Circles of Evaluation @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students match Circles of Evaluation to mathematical expressions, and then they consider how mathematical expressions in words map onto Circles of Evaluation.

=== Launch

Explain to students that they are going to receive three sets of cards.

The first set of cards includes mathematical expressions. Students have definitely encountered those before! The expressions on their cards each include the number 15, the number 3, and an operator (+, -, *, or /).

The second set of cards includes _Circles of Evaluation_. Students have almost definitely never encountered Circles of Evaluation before! Broadly, Circles of Evaluation will help students to visualize the structure of the mathematical expressions they encounter. (We’ll dig into that statement much more throughout this course!) For the time being, here’s what students need to know about Circles of Evaluation:

- Every Circle must have one - and only one! - function, written at the top.

- The inputs of the function are written left to right, in the middle of the Circle.

Share these two key concepts before explaining the following instructions.

[.lesson-instruction]
- With your partner, match each A card with the corresponding B card.
- Lay them out on the table in front of you so you can clearly see both the Circle and the expression. Create a separate pile for any cards that do not have a match.
- Discuss each match that you make.

Circulate as students sort their cards, ensuring that they are carefully analyzing each card so that they see the connection between the arithmetic expression and the Circle of evaluation. This first phase of matching cards should be relatively quick - but it might raise questions on a few topics:

- *Symbols*. Circles utilize * to represent multiplication and / to represent division. (Why? Circles are a bridge representation - one which can eventually be used to help students learn to code! Although we use these symbols on all of our materials, you and your students can use whichever operator symbols are most comfortable.)

- *Order of terms*. Although 5 + 3 and 3 + 5 both evaluate to 8, the Circle of Evaluation that corresponds with each of these expressions is unique.

- *Position of the operator*. The operator always belongs at the top of the Circle, and not in between terms.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, you’re going to receive a set of C cards.
- One at a time, take turns reading each C card out loud. After reading the card, place it with the appropriate Circle and expression.
- Explain to your partner how and why you placed each card.
- You and your partner must agree on each card’s placement before advancing to the next.

Again, ciculate during the activity. As students match expressions in words to their arithmetic expressions and Circles, additional challenges may arise.

[.lesson-instruction]
Practice and apply what you’ve learned on this worksheet.

Ensure that students are confident creating and analyzing simple Circles, as the next section introduces another layer of complexity.


=== Common Misconceptions

- Students often translate "3 less than 15" into @math{3 - 15}, rather than @math{15 - 3}. Discuss the meaning of the word "less" in this context. Sometimes, asking, “What value is 3 less than 15?” can help students to make the connection.

- Difficulty may arise when matching words to the division expression, 15/3. Take advantage of every opportunity to help students connect multiplication and division as inverse operations.

=== Investigate

A useful feature of Circles of Evaluation is that they can contain other Circles!

During the launch, students looked at the Circle for "15 increased by 3."

Let’s say we want to replace @math{15} with @math{3 \times 5}. Now, our expression looks like this: @math{3 \times 5 + 3}.

Translating this mathematical expression into words requires students to complete a number of tasks concurrently.

- First, they must see some sort of structure in expression. (Multiply @math{3} by @math{5} first? Or add @math{5} and @math{3}?)

- Now, they must hold that structure in their heads as they attempt to access (possibly new? possibly unfamiliar?) vocabulary.

- They must map said vocabulary onto the imaginary structure that has quite possibly slipped away by this point.

The Circle of Evaluation for @math{3 \times 5 + 3} looks like this:

[.centered-image]
@show{(coe '(+ (* 3 5) 3))}
@clear


Because the Circles of Evaluation highlight the structure of any given expression, translating into words is a far less daunting task: the inner Circle very clearly shows a product, which is being increased by @math{3} (as the outer Circle indicates).

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete the worksheet with your partner. The top half involves drawing Circles to represent each expression in words.  On the bottom half of the worksheet, write an expression in words to match with each Circle of Evaluation.
- When you’re finished, complete this worksheet to translate between all three representations (the mathematical expression, the Circle of Evaluation, the expression in words).
- Optional: Try this worksheet, where you will match mathematical expressions with their corresponding expressions in words without the Circles included to help you. (If you get stuck, feel free to draw your own!)

Note: The last worksheet also includes a column where students may evaluate the expression. Evaluating is not the primary goal of the activity - but we want students to recognize that computation is indeed a viable way to transform an expression. This column should be the lowest priority.

=== Synthesize
- We did lots of different translations between Circles, words, and arithmetic expressions.
- Was there any type of transformation that was more challenging for you?
- Is there more than one to draw the Circle for @math{1 + 2} ? If so, is one way more "correct" than the other?



== The Ambiguity of Words @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students diagram Circles of Evaluations to consider how different interpretations of words not only parse differently but evaluate differently!


=== Launch

One reason that Circles of Evaluation are so powerful is that they eliminate the ambiguity we often encounter when representing expressions with words. In this lesson, we tackle expressions in words that have _more than one_ possible mathematical translation–-as well as more than one possible solution!

[.lesson-instruction]
- What does “ambiguity” mean?
- Do you think there is ambiguity in math?

=== Investigate

Take a look at this expression: "the sum of three and two multiplied by eight"

Is that an instruction to add three and sixteen (as represented by the Circle on the left)… or is it an instruction to take five - that’s the sum of three and two! - and then multiply it by eight (as represented by the Circle on the right)?!

Words can be confusing! In this case, there is not one single correct mathematical translation. (And it’s debatable whether inserting a comma after the word “two” provides clarity.)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete The Ambiguity of Words, drawing two possible Circles for each expression in words.
- On the second half of the worksheet, write the expression in words that resulted in two different Circle outcomes.

We don't want students to think _all_ mathematical expressions in words are ambiguous, as that is simply not the case! Emphasize that only certain verbal structures create this confusion; some phrases are indeed clearer than others. The following activity emphasizes this idea.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On Ambiguous or Clear?, identify the expressions that have two different numeric translations.
- When you encounter an expression that is ambiguous, choose one of the interpretations. Translate it into a numeric expression, and then _rewrite_ the expression in words so that it is more clear. Use Circles to help if you get stuck!

=== Synthesize

- Why are some expressions in words ambiguous and others are not?
- Do you think that expressions written in the language of math have ambiguity?
- What is it about Circles of Evaluation that removes ambiguity?
