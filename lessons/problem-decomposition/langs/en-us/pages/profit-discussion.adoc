Four students defined the same `revenue` and `cost` functions, shown below:
[.indentedpara]
--
@show{(code '(define (revenue g) (* 1.75 g)))}

@show{(code '(define (cost g) (* 0.30 g)))}
--

@vspace{1ex}

However, they came up with *four different definitions* for `profit`:

@vspace{1ex}

[cols="1a,5a", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| *Khalil:* | @show{(code '(define (profit g) (- (* 1.75 g) (* 0.30 g))))}
| *Samaria:*| @show{(code '(define (profit g) (* (- 1.75 0.30) g)))}
| *Alenka:* | @show{(code '(define (profit g) (* 1.45 g)))}
| *Fauzi:* 	| @show{(code '(define (profit g) (- (revenue g) (cost g))))}
|===

@n Which of these four definitions do you think is "best", and why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Answers may vary, but they should be sensible!_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_A student might argue that Khalil's definition is "closest to the word problem",_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_or that Alenka's is the "fastest" since the computation is already done._}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Fauzi's solution uses the other definitions to do its work, and is the most readable._}}

@n If lemons get more expensive, which definitions of `profit` need to be changed?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Everyone but Fauzi's definition needs to be changed._}}

@n Which definition of `profit` is the most flexible? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Fauzi's definition describes profit as `revenue - cost`,_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{__and can be used with *any* revenue and cost functions.__}}
