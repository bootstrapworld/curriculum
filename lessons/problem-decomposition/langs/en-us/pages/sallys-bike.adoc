= Sally's Bike

We know that it costs Sally 30cents to make a cup of lemonade and she's selling each cup for $1.75.  If the bike Sally wants costs $198 and sales tax in her town is 7 percent, how many cups of lemonade will Sally have to sell in order to buy the bike?

@ifsoln{@math{198 \times 1.07 = 211.86}}

@ifsoln{@math{211.86 \div 1.45 = 146.1103448275862}}

@ifsoln{Sally would have to sell 147 cups of lemonade to buy her bike!}
