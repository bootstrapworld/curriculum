Students watched 5 videos, and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10. While the *average score* for every video is the same (5.5), the *shapes* of the ratings distributions were very different! _Match_ the summary description (left) with the _shape_ of the histogram of student ratings (right). For each histogram, *the x-axis is the score, and the y-axis is the number of students who gave it that score*. These axes are intentionally unlabeled - focusing on the _shape_ is what matters here!
