    "Write a function `distance`, which takes FOUR inputs:
    (1) px: The x-coordinate of the player,
    (2) py: The y-coordinate of the player,
    (3) cx: The x-coordinate of another game character,
    (4) cy: The y-coordinate of another game character.
    It should return the distance between the two, using the
    Distance formula:
    Distance² = (px − cx)² + (py − cy)²"
