== Telling Your Data Story @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn about the _Data Cycle_, which is a scaffold to support asking them in questions, thinking about how those questions relate to the data in front of them, analyzing that data, and interpreting the results.

=== Launch
[.lesson-point]
Are more animals fixed or unfixed?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open your saved Animals Starter File, or @starter-file{animals, make a new copy}.
- Working in pairs, turn to @printable-exercise{ds-intro/pages/animals-dataset.adoc, The Animals Dataset} in your student workbooks, or open @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VeR2_bhpLvnRUZslmCAcSRKfZWs_5RNVujtZgEl6umA/edit?usp=sharing, the Animals Spreadsheet}.
- You and your partner are going to answer a simple question: **are more animals fixed or unfixed?**

Data Science is all about _asking questions of data_. Sometimes the answer is easy to compute. Sometimes the answer to a question is _already in the dataset_ - no computation needed.  And sometimes the answer just sparks more questions!

Data Scientists ask a ton of questions, and each question adds a chapter to their **data story**. Even if a question turns out to be a dead-end, it's valuable to share what the question was and what work you did to answer it!

@right{@image{images/data-cycle.png, "A circular progression: (1) Ask Questions, (2) Consider Data, (3) Analyze Data, (4) Interpret Data, and starting over", 400}}
The Data Cycle[*] is a _roadmap_, which helps guide us in the process of data analysis.

1) We **Ask Questions** - which can be answered with data.

2) We **Consider Data**. This could be done by conducting a survey, observing and recording data, or finding a dataset.

3) We **Analyze the Data**, to produce data displays and new tables of filtered or transformed data, to identify patterns and relationships.

4) We **Interpret the Data**, answering questions and summarizing results. As we've already seen from the Animals Dataset, these interpretations often lead to _new_ questions....and the cycle begins again.

=== Investigate
This was a pretty specific question, and it was straightforward to answer it. But the answers to even simple questions can lead to more interesting questions down the road!

[.lesson-instruction]
What other questions might come from counting the ratio of fixed to unfixed animals?

=== Synthesize
This is a short example of a *Data Story* - a description of how each step in the Data Cycle was used to go from a question to an answer, and then to the next question. When analyzing a real dataset, Data Scientists might explore lots of questions, resulting in many different Data Stories to tell.

Each chapter in the Data Story is valuable, and the Data Cycle represents each chapter you plan to add.

== Ask Questions @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students begin to categorize questions, sorting them into "lookup", "arithmetic", and "statistical" questions - as well as questions that simply can't be answered based on the data.

=== Launch
@right{@image{images/AskQuestions.png, "Ask Questions icon", 200}} How do we know what questions to ask? There’s an art to asking the right questions, and good Data Scientists think hard about what kind of questions can and can’t be answered.

Most questions can be broken down into one of four categories:

- **Lookup questions** can be answered simply by looking up a single value in the table and reading it out. Once you find the value, you’re done! Examples of lookup questions might be “How many legs does Felix have?” or "What species is Sheba?"

- **Arithmetic questions** can be answered by computing an answer across a single column. Examples of arithemetic questions might be “How much does the heaviest animal weigh?” or “What is the average age of animals from the shelter?”

- **Statistical questions** are where things get interesting. If we asked, "How old are animals at the shelter?", there are lots of ways to answer! We could report back the average age, the age that shows up most frequently or the range of the ages. Other  examples of statistical questions might include "How long does it take for an animal to get adopted?" or "What's a typical age for the cats?". There are also some statistical questions that deal with _relationships between *two* columns_: “Do cats tend to be adopted faster than dogs?” or “Are older animals heavier than young ones?”

- **Questions we can't answer** would need data that we don't have. We might wonder where the animal shelter is located, or what time of year the data was gathered! But the data in the table won't help us answer that question, so as Data Scientists we might need to do some research _beyond the data_. And if nothing turns up, we simply recognize that there are limits to what we can analyze.

* What kind of question is "Are more animals fixed or unfixed?"?
** It's an _arithmetic question_.
* What kind of question is "How old is Toggle?"
** It's a _lookup question_.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{which-question-type.adoc}, and fill out the "Type" column in the table at the bottom. *For now, ignore the other columns.*
- Look at the Wonders you wrote on @printable-exercise{ds-intro/pages/questions-and-column-descriptions.adoc}. Are these Lookup, Arithmetic, or Statistical questions?
- OPTIONAL: For more practice, complete @opt-printable-exercise{question-types-animals.adoc}, by coming up with examples of each type of question for the Animals Dataset.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Students generally struggle to make the leap into asking statistical questions. It's worth taking time on this, to support them coming up with better (and more engaging!) questions later.
- They may think that "What's the average weight of the animals?" is a statistical question, because "average" is a term that shows up in statistics. But computing the average is just pure arithmetic! A _statistical_ question would be "What's the typical weight of an animal?", because it does not specify a particular arithmetic process. The answer could be the mean, the median, or even the mode! Figuring out which one to use depends on the distribution of the data, which we'll discuss more in a later lesson.

=== Synthesize

- How would you explain the difference between Lookup. Arithmetic, and Statistical questions?
- When you looked back at your Wonders from the Animals Dataset, were they mostly Lookup questions? Arithmetic? Statistical?
- What are some examples of statistical questions the owner of a sports team might ask? Or a researcher who is trying to see if a cancer drug is effective? Or a principal who wants to know what will help their students the most?

== Consider Data @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students bridge from a human-language question into something more formal, by specifying the rows and columns they would need to examine. This activity stresses a hard programming skill (reading Contracts) with formal reading comprehension (identifying key portions of a statistical instruction).

=== Launch
Once we have our question, it's time to figure out what data we'll need to answer it!

[.lesson-point]
When considering data, we ask:

* **Which Rows** do we need?
* **Which Column(s)** do we care about?

@right{@image{images/ConsiderData.png, "Consider Data icon", 200}} Tables are made of *Rows* and *Columns*. Each Row represents one member of our population. In the Animals Dataset, each row represents a single animal. In a dataset of temperature readings, each row might represent the temperature at a particular hour.


Columns, on the other hand, represent information _about each row_. Every animal, for example, has columns for their name, species, sex, age, weight, legs, whether they are fixed or unfixed, and how long it took to be adopted.

If we want to know which cat is the heaviest, we _only care about rows for cats_, and _we only need the `pounds` column_. If we want to know how many fixed animals are rabbits, _we only care about rows for fixed animals_, and _we only need the `species` column_.

[.lesson-instruction]
* If our question is "How old is Mittens?", what rows and column(s) do we need?
** _We only need one row for Mittens, and we just need the `age` column_
* If our question is "Which animal is the heaviest?", what rows and column(s) do we need?
** _We need to compare every row, and we only look at the `pounds` column_
* What rows and columns did we need to answer "Are more animals fixed or unfixed?"?
** We needed to look at _all_ the rows, but the only column we care about is `fixed`.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Return to @printable-exercise{which-question-type.adoc}. For each question, which rows would you need to answer them? Which columns would you look at? Write your answers in the last two columns of the table at the bottom.
- Complete @printable-exercise{which-rows-which-columns.adoc}.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Students often forget that questions like "Who is the oldest?" or "What is the most?" require looking at _every row_ in the table.

=== Synthesize
Have students share their answers and discuss any questions they have about these pages.

How does asking "Which rows? Which columns?" help us figure out what code to write?

== Analyzing Data @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students progress to the third step in the Data Cycle, by combining the "Consider Data" stepwith their knowledge of Contracts to help them _Analyze_ that data.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/AnalyzeData.png, "Analyze Data icon", 200}} Once we know what data we need, we can turn our attention to what we want to build with it!

- Do we need to filter out certain rows and make a new table?
- Do we need a pie chart?
- Should we make a histogram?

What kinds of displays can help us analyze whether there are more fixed or unfixed animals? We could use a bar-chart _or_ a pie-chart to do this analysis, but since we care more about the ratio ("2x as many fixed as unfixed") than the actual count ("20 fixed vs. 10 fixed") a pie chart is the better choice.

Once we've decided what to make and we know which rows and columns we're plotting, the next step is to _write the code!_

Once we know that we want a pie-chart, and that we're using it to look at the `fixed` column, analyzing the data is as easy as reading the Contract!

=== Investigate
Let's get some practice going from questions to code, and making data displays in the process!

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{analyzing-with-displays.adoc}, and see if you can fill in the first 3 steps of the Data Cycle for a set of predefined questions. When you're finished, try to make the display in Pyret.

Have students share their results. What did their charts tell them?

=== Synthesize
@right{@image{images/InterpretData.png, "Interpret Data icon", 100}} In this case, we got a clear answer to our question. But perhaps that's not the end of the story! We might be curious about whether a higher percentage of dogs are spayed and neutered than cats, or whether it's even possible to "fix" a tarantula. _All of this belongs in our data story!_

How do Contracts and the Data Cycle work together, to help us figure out what program will answer our questions?
