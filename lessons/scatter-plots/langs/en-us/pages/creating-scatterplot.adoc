. *For each row in the Sample Table on the left, add a point to the scatter plot on the right*. Use the values from the age column for the x-axis, and values from the weeks column for the y-axis.

. Do you see a pattern? Do the points seem to go up or down as age increases to the right?  

** *Draw a cloud around all the points, and a line around which the cloud appears to be centered*

. Does the line slope upwards or downwards? @fitb{35em}{}

. Are the points tightly clustered around the line or loosely scattered?  @fitb{25em}{}
