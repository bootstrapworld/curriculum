The distance between @math{x_{1}} and @math{x_{2}} is computed by @show{(code '(line-length x1 x2))}. The distance between @math{y_{1}} and @math{y_{2}} is computed by @show{(code '(line-length y1 y2))}. Below is the equation to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle with those amount for legs:

[.center.big]
@math{\sqrt{line\mbox{-}length(x_{2}, x_{1})^2 + line\mbox{-}length(y_{2}, y_{1})^2}}

Suppose your player is at *(0, 2)* and a character is at *(4, 5)*. What is the distance between them? With your pencil, label which numbers represent @math{x_{1}}, @math{y_{1}}, @math{x_{2}} and @math{y_{2}}. The equation to compute the distance between these points is:

[.center.big]
@math{\sqrt{line\mbox{-}length(4, 0)^2 + line\mbox{-}length(5, 2)^2}}

*1. Translate the expression above, for (0,2) and (4,5) into a Circle of Evaluation below*.
