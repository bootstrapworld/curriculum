The distance between @math{x_{1}} and @math{x_{2}} is computed by @show{(code '(line-length x1 x2))}. The distance between @math{y_{1}} and @math{y_{2}} is computed by @show{(code '(line-length y1 y2))}. Below is the equation to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle with those amount for legs:

[.center.big]
@math{\sqrt{line\mbox{-}length(x_{2}, x_{1})^2 + line\mbox{-}length(y_{2}, y_{1})^2}}

Suppose your player is at *(0, 2)* and a character is at *(4, 5)*. What is the distance between them?

*1. Identify the values of @math{x_{1}}, @math{y_{1}}, @math{x_{2}}, and @math{y_{2}}*

[cols="^.<1a,^.<1a,^.<1a,^.<1a", stripes="none"]
|===
| @math{x_{1}} | @math{y_{1}} | @math{x_{2}} | @math{y_{2}}

| _(x-value of 1st point)_
| _(y-value of 1st point)_
| _(x-value of 2nd point)_
| _(y-value of 2nd point)_

The equation to compute the distance between these points is:

[.center.big]
@math{\sqrt{line\mbox{-}length(4, 0)^2 + line\mbox{-}length(5, 2)^2}}

*2. Translate the expression above, for (0,2) and (4,5) into a Circle of Evaluation below*.

_Hint: In our programming language @show{(code 'sqr)} is used for @math{x^2} and @show{(code 'sqrt)} is used for @math{\sqrt{x}}_

*3. Convert the Circle of Evaluation to Code below*.

@ifnotsoln{
@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}
}

@showsoln{(code '(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length x1 x2)) (line-length x1 x2))))}
