# The Game Starter File

By now you’ve learned about defining values, composing functions, and reading contracts. 

Taken together, that’s a lot of code you’re now able to understand! 

It’s time to flex your reading skills, and look at the file you’ll be working with to build your video game.

# The Game Starter File

Read through the @starter-file{game}.

This file contains a lot of code! Some of it you haven’t seen before.

Going line-by-line, talk with your group about what you think each line does.

# The Game Starter File

- What familiar things did you see in the Game Starter File file?
- What were some unfamiliar things?  Any idea what they might do?
- What data type is `GAME-TITLE`?  What data type is `BACKGROUND`?
- What does `SCREENSHOT` return in the @vocab{Interactions area}?
- Did anyone try pressing Run?  What happens when you press Run?*

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
- What do you think `image-url` does?
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
* What do you think `image-url` does?
}


<!--
- *What familiar things did you see in the Game Starter File file?*
- *What were some unfamiliar things?  Any idea what they might do?*
_Answers vary: new functions, comments, images_

- *What data type is `GAME-TITLE`?  What data type is `BACKGROUND`?*
_``GAME-TITLE`` is a String, `BACKGROUND` is an Image_

- *What does `SCREENSHOT` return in the @vocab{Interactions area}?*
_An image of the `BACKGROUND`, `PLAYER`, `TARGET`, and `DANGER` all together_

- *Did anyone try pressing "Run"?  What happens when you press "Run"?*
_Allow students to discuss what they see and what connections they see with the code_

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
- *What do you think `image-url` does?*
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
* *What do you think `image-url` does?*
_Answers vary: It consumes a @vocab{String}, which is a URL (an image location on the Internet) and produces the @vocab{Image} inside our program_
}

# Finding Your Game Images

`image-url :: String  ->  Image`

- This function takes in a web address for an image, and produces the image! (Is it in your contracts page?)
- You can use `rotate`, `scale`, etc. with this image!
- Save a copy to your account
