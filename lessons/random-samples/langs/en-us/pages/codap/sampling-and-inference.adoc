@n In the screenshots of the “Sampler” (below), show how you would create a small random sample (of 10 animals) and a large random sample (of 40 animals). _To create two separate tables (rather than a single hierarchical table), re-select and re-open “Sampler” from the Plugins menu before each sampling simulation._

@n In the options tab, did you select “with replacement” or “without replacement”? Why?

@n Make a bar chart for the animals in each sample, showing percentages of fixed and unfixed.

- The percentage of fixed animals in the entire population is @fitb{20ex}{*47.7%*}.
- The percentage of fixed animals in `small-sample` is @fitb{20ex}{}.
- The percentage of fixed animals in `large-sample` is @fitb{20ex}{}.

@n Make a bar chart for the animals in each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is @fitb{20ex}{*roughly 5%*}.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is @fitb{20ex}{}.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `large-sample` is @fitb{20ex}{}.

@n Direct the sampler to generate a different set of random samples of these sizes. Make a new bar chart for each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is @fitb{20ex}{*roughly 5%*}.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is @fitb{20ex}{}.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `large-sample` is @fitb{20ex}{}.

@n Which repeated sample gave us a more accurate inference about the whole population? Why?
