@n In the Definitions Area of the @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1d3HuG_LjdX9HpfQPCmVmDG9mYml4nOX8&v=ebd213d, Expanded Animals Starter File}, define the following samples:
----
tiny-sample = random-rows(big-animals-table, 10)
small-sample = random-rows(big-animals-table, 20)
medium-sample = random-rows(big-animals-table, 40)
large-sample = random-rows(big-animals-table, 80)
----

@n Click run and make a `pie-chart` of the species in the `tiny-sample`. What animals are in the sample? @fitb{}{}

- Click run for a _new_ random `tiny-sample`, and make _another_ pie-chart for species. What animals are there? @fitb{}{}
- Click run for a _new_ random sample, and make _yet another_ pie-chart for species. Based on these 3 samples, how many species do you think are at the shelter? @fitb{3em}{}
- Which is the _most common_ species at the shelter? @fitb{3em}{}

@n What did you learn from taking multiple samples that you wouldn't have known if you'd only taken a single sample?

@span{.blankline}

@n Repeat the steps above, but for `small-sample`. What animals are in the sample? @fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Now that you've seen `small-sample`, how has your sense of the distribution of the species changed?

@span{.blankline}

@n Now use `medium-sample` to make a `pie-chart` of the species.  If there are about 400 animals at the shelter, how many of each species would you predict there to be?

@span{.blankline}

@n Now use `large-sample` to make a `pie-chart` of the species. If there's anything you'd like to change about your prediction now that you've seen `large-sample`, record it here.

@span{.blankline}

@n Let's see how accurate your prediction is... _feel free to click run and build a few more pie charts from your samples if you want to collect more information first!_ When you're ready, make a `pie-chart` of `animals-table-2`.

- Which predictions were closest? @fitb{27em}{}
- Which predictions were off? @fitb{28em}{}
- Were there any surprises?@fitb{29em}{}

@n In the real world, we usually don't have access to a whole dataset to check predictions against! How could we test...

- _Every giraffe on the planet?_

- _Everyone who has ever come in contact with a covid-positive person?_

- _Every person who identifies as queer?_

*What strategies can we use to make sure that predictions from samples are as close to accurate as possible?*
