@description{Students define row-consuming functions and combine them with advanced display contracts to create compeling data displays.}

== 1. Get Inspired

Data visualization is where data science and creativity mix. Data displays are meant to __tell a story__, and storytelling is an art form!

Take a moment to explore these resources, and choose **one display** that really interests you:

@vspace{1ex}

- @opt-online-exercise{https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html, The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop}
- @opt-online-exercise{https://insightfulinteraction.com/immigration200years.html, 200 Years of Immigration}
- @opt-online-exercise{https://informationisbeautiful.net/, Information is Beautiful}

@vspace{1ex}

Copy/paste the display into a new document, along with a link to where you got it. Then write a paragraph about why you chose this display. Why was the topic interesting to you? How do the visuals in the display relate to that topic? How do they make the display more accessible or exciting?

== 2. Find Your Data

@right{@image{../images/age-v-weeks.gif, 200}}
@lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset, Choose a dataset} that interests you - or one that you're already working with - and use `bar-chart`, `pie-chart`, `histogram`, or `scatter-plot` to create a simple display that is interesting to you. Copy/paste this display into your project document, along with a link to the dataset and the code you used to make the display. Then write a paragraph about what this display shows and why it would be interesting to someone else. For example, the image on the right might be interesting because it suggests a moderate correlation between age and weeks: older animals take longer to be adopted, but it's not as direct a connection as others might think!

== 3. What Data Is Missing?

In our example scatter plot from the Animals Dataset, we might wonder whether the _species_ matters, how big the animal is, or whether or not it's fixed. This gives us both _an observation_ and a _more advanced question_ to ask about our data:

@vspace{1ex}

**Different species of animals have very different lifespans. Is the correlation between age and adoption time different for each species?**

@vspace{1ex}

What other columns might be important to _your_ display? Think about at least two columns that might give you more insight into your data, and why those other columns matter in the display(s) you've chosen. Wsrite the __observations__ and __questions__ in your project document.

== 4. Make it Beautiful

Once we wrote code to add the species column to our data display, we saw some interesting results! Right away, we can see that cats and dogs take longer to be adopted based on their age, but the impact of each extra year is much smaller for cats than for dogs. It's almost like we have two stronger correlations in the same display: the line for dogs slopes up more steeply, and the line for cats is more gentle. When all the dots looked the same, these lines blurred each other out to create one weak-to-moderate correlation. *Now*, define a row-consuming function that produces custom images for each Row in your dataset using your new column(s), and use it to create a data display that makes the data _pop_ and really shows the deeper patterns at work. Copy/paste your visualization into a your project document, along with the code used to generate it. Then write a paragraph about how your custom display uses visual cues to enhance the display. As in our animals example, write about what new insights you gained and why you couldn't see them in the original display.
