To help you with this page, we've re-printed the contract for the `text` function, and an example of how to use it. (Don't forget - you can always find the contracts you need at the back of your workbook!)

@vspace{2ex}

@show{(contract 'text '("String" "Number" "String") "Image")}

@show{(code '(text "hello" 24 "green"))}


@n On the three lines below, write the code to lookup the value of the `species` column from `dog-row`, `old-row`, and `young-row`.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`dog-row["species"]`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`old-row["species"]`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`young-row["species"]`}}


@n On the three lines below, write the code that uses the `text` function to show the species of those same three rows in __red, 15px letters__.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(dog-row["species"], 15, "red")`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(old-row["species"], 15, "red")`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`text(young-row["species"], 15, "red")`}}

@n When you are confident with the code you have written, check with your partner or another student. Do you have the same code? Why or why not?

_Instead of writing this out over and over for each animal, let's define a function to do it for us!_
