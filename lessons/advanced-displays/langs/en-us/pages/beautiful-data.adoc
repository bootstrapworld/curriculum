@description{Students define row-consuming functions and combine them with advanced display contracts to create compeling data displays.}

== Get Inspired

Data visualization is where data science and creativity mix. Data displays are meant to __tell a story__, and storytelling is an art form!

Take a moment to explore these resources, and choose **one display** that really interests you:

- @opt-online-exercise{https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html, The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop}
- @opt-online-exercise{https://insightfulinteraction.com/immigration200years.html, 200 Years of Immigration}
- @opt-online-exercise{https://informationisbeautiful.net/, Information is Beautiful}

Copy/paste the display into a new document, along with a link to where you got it. Then write a paragraph about why you chose this display. Why was the topic interesting to you? How do the visuals in the display relate to that topic? How do they make the display more accessible or exciting?

== Find Your Data

@lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset, Choose a dataset} that interests you, and use `bar-chart`, `pie-chart`, `histogram`, and `scatter-plot` to create a display that is interesting to you.

Copy/paste this display into your project document, along with a link to the dataset and the code you used to make the display. Then write a paragraph about what this display shows and why it would be interesting to someone else.

== Make it Beautiful

Get creative! Define a row-consuming function that produces custom images for each Row in your dataset, and use it to create a data display that makes the display _pop_.

Copy/paste your visualization into a new document, along with the code used to generate it. Then write a paragraph about how your custom display uses visual cues to enhance the display.
