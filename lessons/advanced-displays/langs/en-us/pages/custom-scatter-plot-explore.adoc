= Custom Scatter Plot - Explore

Make sure you have @starter-file{custom-scatter-plot} open on your computer. Save a copy, and click "Run" to see the scatter-plot.

@n Comment-out the `scatter-plot` expression on line 53 by putting a `#` at the start of line. This will "turn off" the expression, by telling Pyret to ignore that line.

@n What is `species-tag`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A function!}}

@n Click "Run". What happens when you evaluate `species-tag(cat-row)`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{an image is produced: the word "cat" in red letters}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What do you expect the `image-scatter-plot` expression on line 54 to produce?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers may vary}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Un-comment line 54 to "turn on" that code, then click "Run". What image appears?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each of the points on the plot is labeled with its species name in red.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What can you learn from this new display that you could not learn from the original image?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{All of the heavy animals are dogs and the other species weigh under 10 pounds.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n What ideas do you have for how else we could draw the dots in a scatter plot of the animals, so that it would be even more useful?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample responses: Use more than one color? Use different symbols?}}

@n Find the other two "Helper Functions" in the file (`legs-tag` and `age-tag`). How are their definitions similar to `species-tag`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{They also consume a row and look up a specific variable.}}

@n How are their definitions _different_ from `species-tag`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The lookup information is used as a size rather than converted to a text image.}}

@n Make a custom scatter plot using `legs-tag`. Then make another using `age-tag`. What is most interesting to you about the plots you just made?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Student responses will vary!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Suppose we wanted to make a custom scatter plot where each point is labeled with the _name_ of the animal. What would we need to define, to use in our custom scatter plot expression?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a `name-tag` helper function.}}


@n Make the new custom scatter plot described above. Write the definition of your helper function, and the custom scatter plot expression here:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ `fun name-tag(r): text(r["name"], 15, "red") end`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ `image-scatter-plot(animals-table, "pounds", "weeks", name-tag)`}}
