= Exploring Image Scatter Plots

Look at the code in the @starter-file{custom-scatter-plot}.

@n Compare the definitions of `age-dot` and `species-tag` to what you wrote. Are they the same? If not, what is different?

__Answer the following questions about the last line of code in the file, which is commented out.__

@n What is the *name* of the function being used here? @fitb{15em}{@ifsoln{image-scatter-plot}}
 How many things are in its *Domain*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4}}

@n What is the 1st argument? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{animals-table}} What is its *data type?* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Table}}

@n What is the 2nd argument? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{"pounds"}} What is its *data type?* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{String}}

@n What is the 3rd argument? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{"weeks"}} What is its *data type?* @fitb{}{@ifsoln{String}}

@n What is the 4th argument? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{age-dot}}

@n What is the *data type* for the the fourth thing in the Domain? If you're not sure, write down your thinking. What can you rule out? What do you think it _might_ be?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a function - because `age-dot` is the name of a function. Typing it into Pyret produces `<function:age-dot>`}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Uncomment the last line at the bottom of the file, and click "Run". What does `image-scatter-plot` do with its 4th argument?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It draws a scatter plot, but in place of each dot is a new image.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The image is determined by whatever the function produces for each Row.}}

@fitb{}

@n Try changing your `age-dot` function to use different colors, or even different shapes! Can you make the size of the shape be _one half_ the age of the animal?

@n *On a new line* in the Definitions Area, try making an `image-scatter-plot` using the `species-tag` function. When you click Run, compare all three scatter plots.
