== Functions that Consume Rows @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students review the concepts of column lookups and function definition, by writing functions that consume rows and do some computation on their columns.

=== Launch

You've learned how to take a complex value like a Row, and lookup a column. And you've also seen how to define functions that consume simple values like Numbers and Strings. Let's put those two together, and define functions that consume Rows!


=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{age-dot.adoc}, and complete the top half of the page (questions 1 and 2).
- Compare your answers to some other students. If you each wrote down different answers, talk about what's different and what's the same.

Review student answers. Every student should have the same code for this part!

[.lesson-instruction]
- You could imagine doing this for every animal in the shelter, but that would be a lot of very repetitive work. This is exactly what functions are made for!
- Open your saved Animals Starter File (or @starter-file{animals, "start a new one"}), and type in the Contract, Examples, and Definition for `pounds-dot` into the Definitions Area.
- Click "Run", and make sure your examples pass. Then try using your new function on some of the other Rows defined there, like `lizard-row` and `young-row`.

Review the Contract, Examples and Definition with students, making sure to point out the connections between each representation!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{species-tag.adoc}, and complete the top half of the page (questions 1 and 2).
- When you are confident with the code you have written - check with your teacher or a partner - complete the rest of the page to define a function `species-tag`.
- In your Animals Starter File, type in the Contract, Examples, and Definition for `species-tag` into the Definitions Area.
- Click "Run", and make sure your examples pass. Then try using your new function on some of the other Rows defined there, like `lizard-row` and `young-row`.

=== Synthesize

* One of the functions we wrote used the `pounds` column, and the other used the `species` column. One is a Number and the other is a String, so why did both functions consume _Rows?_
** __What a function consumes__ is not the same as the __work the function does__. Both functions consumed Rows, but one function looked up the `pounds` column - a Number - and the other looked up the `species` column - a String.
* How is this similar to the other functions you've defined, like `gt` and `bc`? How is it different?


== Image Scatter Plots @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to @show{(code 'image-scatter-plot)}, which consumes a function and uses it to draw custom images in place of dots. **Programming note:** `image-scatter-plot` is an example of _higher order functions_, which are functions consume other functions as inputs.

=== Launch

Do you think an animal's weight effects how long it stays at the shelter? Why or why not?

Many apartment buildings have limits on how heavy a pet can be, which could make bigger animals harder to adopt. If we're looking for a relationship between two variables, we know that we need a scatter plot! Let's start out by making a scatter plot to look for a relationship between Pounds and Weeks.

@center{@image{images/pounds-v-weeks.png, 450}}

There seems to be a positive relationship , but it's not very strong. Perhaps pounds isn't the only thing that determines how quickly an animal is adopted! Maybe people want to adopt _younger_ animals because they think older animals might have more health problems.

How could we represent an animal's age on this scatter plot, while still showing the relationship between `pounds` and `weeks`?

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
With a partner or in small groups, complete @printable-exercise{image-scatter-explore.adoc}

The contract for `image-scatter-plot` looks pretty different from other contracts we've seen.

[.forceShading]
--
```
image-scatter-plot :: (
  t  :: Table,
  xs :: String,
  ys :: String,
  f  :: (Row -> Image)
) -> Image
```
--

The function `image-scatter-plot` has an interesting Domain: _Table, String, String and... what is that last part?... *a Function that consumes a Row and produces an Image*!_

=== Synthesize

* How does having the dots labeled with the species change your understanding of the data?

__Students should recognize that the `species-tag` @vocab{scatter plot} makes it clear that we may want to analyze each species separately, rather than grouping them all together. (In the Grouped Samples lesson, students will learn how to do just that!)__

@center{@image{images/species-tag.png, "A scatter plot with species names for each animal in place of a small, uniform dot. The images are generated by the species-tag function", 450}}

* What other ways could we use the columns in each row to pack more information into our scatter plots?
** Use legs and age to determine width and height of a rectangle
** Use different colors or shapes based on species, sex, or fixed-status

== Piecewise/Conditional Functions @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students discover how to use @vocab{conditionals} - @vocab{piecewise functions} in math - to create more complex scatter plots, and also custom bar charts, pie charts, and histograms. Experimentation becomes the motivation for more practice with Row-consuming functons.

*NOTE:* Math teachers may want their students to confront piecewise functions more deeply, and CS teachers may want to spend more time on conditionals. While not a part of the Data Science pathway, the @lesson-link{piecewise-functions-conditionals/} lesson includes a lot of supporting material and practice pages for these topics, including the @link{pages/notes-piecewise-functions.html, student notes on piecewise functions}.

=== Launch
So far, we've seen that...

* the `scatter-plot` function makes uniform blue dots
* the `image-scatter-plot` function can label each point with a custom image, computed by a helper function that consumes Rows and produces Images.

How could we use _different color dots_ for each species? Or perhaps draw different shapes depending on whether an animal was fixed or not?

This requires a more powerful kind of function, known in math as a @vocab{piecewise function} because it has more than one "piece". In programming, these are often called "conditional" functions, because each piece is used depending on which condition is met.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
* Open the @starter-file{piecewise-displays} and complete @printable-exercise{pages/piecewise-explore.adoc}.
* Can you come up with another piecewise function?

[.strategy-box, cols="1a", grid="none", stripes="none"]

@span{.title}{ Optional: When your conditional is _already_ a Boolean }
If you have time or students who are ready for a challenge, you can also have them make a scatter plot for dots distinguishing whether the animal is fixed or not using the directions at the end of the starter file or @opt-printable-exercise{fixed-dot-dr.adoc}. Students will discover that this is a little different from the other two functions they've seen because `fixed` is already a Boolean column! The code will work if written in either of the following ways:
[.comparison, cols="<4a,<3a", options="header"]
!===
! Checking the Boolean
! Using the Boolean Directly

!
```
fun fixed-dot(r):
  if      (r["fixed"] == true) : circle(5, "solid", "green")
  else if (r["fixed"] == false): circle(5, "solid", "black")
  end
end
```
!
```
fun fixed-dot(r):
  if r["fixed"]: circle(5, "solid", "green")
  else: circle(5, "solid", "black")
  end
end
```
!===

OPTIONAL: For students who are really into graphics, and making thir displays as cool as possible, direct them to the @opt-starter-file{piecewise-animal-images} and @opt-printable-exercise{animal-image-explore.adoc}.

OPTIONAL: For students who are really ready for a challenge, direct them to the @opt-starter-file{custom-scatter-plot-w-range} and @opt-printable-exercise{value-range-dot-explore.adoc}.

|===

Pyret allows us to create advanced displays for several types of charts. You can find them in the back of your workbook, but here is the complete list:

@show{(contracts
  '("image-scatter-plot" ("Table" "String" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-histogram" ("Table" "String" "Number" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-bar-chart" ("Table" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-pie-chart" ("Table" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
)}


=== Synthesize
- How do piecewise functions expand what is possible for displaying data?
- How could you see this power being used to help express complex relationships?
