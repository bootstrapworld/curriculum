== Processing Rows with Functions @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

This section motivates the combination of function definition and column lookups, applying algebraic thinking to Data Science. Students review the concepts of column lookups and function definition by writing functions that consume rows and use the value of one column to create an image.

=== Launch

Sometimes, data science means you need to be creative and artistic!

@center{@image{images/age-v-weeks-species-dot.png}}

This is a scatter plot of the animals dataset, showing the age on the x-axis and the weeks spent at the shelter on the y-axis.

[.lesson-instruction]
* What is different about this plot, from ones you've seen before?
** __Sample responses: More colorful, prettier, pictures of animals, etc.__

This scatter plot isn't just _prettier_ - it's also more useful! Scatter plots typically only show two variables from each Row in the Table (the x and y), but this plot is showing us three.

[.lesson-instruction]
* What's the third column being visualized here?
** `species`

To dig deeper into your data, sometimes you need to see more than 2 variables at once! By processing each Row separately, we can make use of all the columns we want to draw beautiful, creative, and insightful data displays. In this lesson, you'll learn how to do just that.

But how do we process each Row separately? You've learned how to take a complex value like a Row, and lookup a column. We could write a line of code that does that for every Row in the table... but that would take a long time and would result in a LOT of code! You've also seen how to define functions that consume simple values, and __do all the repetitve work for us__. Let's put those two concepts together, and define functions that consume Rows!


=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{age-dot.adoc}, and complete the top half of the page (questions 1 and 2).
- Compare your answers to some other students'. If you each wrote down different answers, talk about what's different and what's the same.

Review student answers. Every student should have the same code for this part!

[.lesson-instruction]
- You could imagine doing this for every animal in the shelter, but that would be a lot of very repetitive work. This is exactly what functions are made for!
- Open your saved Animals Starter File (or @starter-file{animals, "start a new one"}), and type the Contract, Examples, and Definition for `age-dot` into the Definitions Area.
- Click "Run", and make sure your examples pass. Then try using your new function on some of the other Rows defined there, like `lizard-row` and `cat-row`.

Review the Contract, Examples and Definition with students, making sure to point out the connections between each representation!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{species-tag.adoc}, and complete the top half of the page (questions 1 and 2).
- When you are confident with the code you have written - check with your teacher or a partner - complete the rest of the page to define a function `species-tag`.
- In your Animals Starter File, type the Contract, Examples, and Definition for `species-tag` into the Definitions Area.
- Click "Run", and make sure your examples pass. Then try using your new function on some of the other Rows defined there, like `lizard-row` and `cat-row`.

=== Synthesize

* One of the functions we wrote used the `age` column, and the other used the `species` column. One is a Number and the other is a String, so why did both functions consume _Rows?_
** __What a function consumes__ is not the same as the __work the function does__. Both functions consumed Rows, but one function looked up the `age` column - a Number - and the other looked up the `species` column - a String.
* How is this similar to the other functions you've defined, like `gt` and `bc`? How is it different?
** It's similar in that it makes images based on numeric data, from the one argument in its Domain. But instead of that argument _being a Number_, it's a _Row that contains a Number_. So instead of using that input verbatim, the function needs to use a lookup to get that Number out of the Row.


== Image Scatter Plots @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to @show{(code 'image-scatter-plot)}, which consumes a function and uses it to draw custom images in place of dots. Image scatter plots offer deeper insight into subgroups within a population, motivating students to define their own functions and deepen their analysis.

**CS or Programming teachers take note:** `image-scatter-plot` is an example of a _higher order function_, or a function that consumes another function as its input. Curiosity and creativity combine to motivate more advanced programming.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
Do you think an animal's weight affects how long it stays at the shelter? Why or why not?

Many apartment buildings have limits on how heavy a pet can be, which could make bigger animals harder to adopt. If we're looking for a relationship between two variables, we know that we need a scatter plot! Let's start out by making a scatter plot to look for a relationship between Pounds and Weeks.

@center{@image{images/pounds-v-weeks.png, 450}}

There seems to be a positive relationship, but it's not very strong.

[.lesson-instruction]
- What other factors might influence how quickly an animal is adopted?
** _Invite students to share their ideas and explain their rationale. Possible responses: Maybe fixed animals are adopted more quickly. Maybe some species are adopted more quickly. Maybe age plays a role..._

Let's say we want to consider the influence of *age* on how how quickly an animal is adopted - while simultaneously considering the relationship between pounds and weeks to adoption. Fortunately, there's a way to do this... __custom scatter plots!__

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open the @starter-file{custom-scatter-plot}.
- With a partner or in small groups, complete Numbers 1-7 on @printable-exercise{image-scatter-explore.adoc}.
- Based on the work that you just completed, what is the Contract for `image-scatter-plot`?
** _Disucss as a class, or in small groups. See explanation, below, of the `image-scatter-plot` Contract._

The contract for `image-scatter-plot` looks pretty different from other contracts we've seen.

[.forceShading]
--
```
image-scatter-plot :: (
  t  :: Table,
  xs :: String,
  ys :: String,
  f  :: (Row -> Image)
) -> Image
```
--

The function `image-scatter-plot` has an interesting Domain: _Table, String, String and... what is that last part?... *a Function that consumes a Row and produces an Image*!_

[.lesson-instruction]
- What do you think the resulting custom scatter plot will look like? You may want to refer back to @printable-exercise{age-dot.adoc}.
** _Students should make predictions based on their work on @printable-exercise{age-dot.adoc}._
- Now complete questions 8, 9, and 10 on @printable-exercise{image-scatter-explore.adoc} to see the scatter plot that will be generated and then experiment with modifying its code.
** _The scatter plot that will be generated is below._

@center{@image{images/age-dot.png, 450}}

[.lesson-instruction]
- Do the bottom portion of the worksheet, which invites you to consider what new insights you can glean from your custom displays.
- How did having the dots labeled with the _species_ change your understanding of the data?
** __The `species-tag` @vocab{scatter plot} (below) makes it clear that we may want to analyze each species separately, rather than grouping them all together. (In the Grouped Samples lesson, students will learn how to do just that!)__

@center{@image{images/species-tag.png, 450}}

=== Synthesize

* What other ways could we use the columns in each row of the Animals Table to pack more information into our scatter plots?
** Use legs and age to determine width and height of a rectangle
** Use different colors or shapes based on species, sex, or fixed-status
* How are the charts produced by `image-scatter-plot` different from those produced by `scatter-plot`? Why do these differences exist? (Think about their Contracts!)
** `image-scatter-plot` consumes a function that can draw different dots depending on each Row in the dataset, along with information about which columns contain the x- and y-coordinates. In contrast, `scatter-plot` because it only consumes information about _where_ the dots are drawn, and not _how_ they are drawn.
* How might image-scatter-plot be useful to your own analysis?

== Piecewise/Conditional Functions @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students discover how to use @vocab{conditionals} - @vocab{piecewise functions} in math - to create more complex scatter plots, and also custom bar charts, pie charts, and histograms. Experimentation becomes the motivation for more practice with Row-consuming functons.

*NOTE:* Math teachers may want their students to confront piecewise functions more deeply, and CS teachers may want to spend more time on conditionals. While not a part of the Data Science pathway, the @lesson-link{piecewise-functions-conditionals/} lesson includes a lot of supporting material and practice pages for these topics, with greater emphasis on the math connections.

=== Launch
So far, we've seen that...

* the `scatter-plot` function makes uniform blue dots
* the `image-scatter-plot` function can label each point with a custom image, computed by a helper function that consumes a Row and produces an Image

How could we use _different color dots_ for each species? Or perhaps draw different shapes depending on whether an animal was fixed or not?

This requires a more powerful kind of function, known in math as a @vocab{piecewise function} because it has more than one "piece". In programming, these are often called "conditional" functions, because each piece is used depending on which condition is met.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
* __Starting on paper__, complete @printable-exercise{pages/piecewise-explore.adoc}.
* When you're finishing thinking and writing, open the @starter-file{piecewise-displays} and experiment!
* Can you come up with another piecewise function?
* Make sure to finish the remainder of the page!

[.strategy-box, cols="1a", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
@span{.title}{ Optional: When your conditional is _already_ a Boolean }
If you have time or students who are ready for a challenge, you can also have them make a scatter plot with dots distinguishing whether the animal is fixed or not using @opt-printable-exercise{fixed-dot-dr.adoc}. Students will discover that this is a little different from the other two functions they've seen because `fixed` is already a Boolean column!

The following two functions __do the same thing__. Notice how much cleaner the second example is!

[.comparison, cols="<1a", options="header"]
!===
! Checking the Boolean
!
```
fun fixed-dot(r):
  if      (r["fixed"] == true) : circle(5, "solid", "green")
  else if (r["fixed"] == false): circle(5, "solid", "black")
  end
end
```
!===
[.comparison, cols="<1a", options="header"]
!===
! Using the Boolean Directly
!
```
fun fixed-dot(r):
  if r["fixed"]: circle(5, "solid", "green")
  else:          circle(5, "solid", "black")
  end
end
```
!===

**For students who are really into graphics:** To take their data displays to the next level, have them check out @opt-starter-file{piecewise-animal-images} and @opt-printable-exercise{animal-image-explore.adoc}.

**For students who are really ready for a programming challenge:** have them open @opt-starter-file{custom-scatter-plot-w-range} and complete @opt-printable-exercise{value-range-dot-explore.adoc}.

Pyret allows us to create advanced displays for several types of charts. You can find them in the back of your workbook, but here is the complete list:

@show{(contracts
  '("image-scatter-plot" ("Table" "String" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-histogram" ("Table" "String" "Number" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-bar-chart" ("Table" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
  '("image-pie-chart" ("Table" "String" "(Row -> Image)") "Image")
)}

| @span{.title}{Optional Project: Beautiful Data}

Data Visualization is a growing and fascinating field. It's about more than making charts look cool - it's about connecting artistic expression to data in ways that are relevant and meaningful. The @opt-project{beautiful-data-project.adoc, beautiful-data-rubric.adoc} project gives students a chance to advance their programming skills by using code to add their own flair and style to data that matters to them.
