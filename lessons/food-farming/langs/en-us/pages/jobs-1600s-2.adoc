@vocab{Bar chart}: A display showing the number of times each value of a categorical variable appears in a data set. Bar charts help us see what’s the most frequent value of a categorical variable. This value is called the mode. To find the mode, just look for the category with the tallest bar.

@vocab{Mode(s)}: The most common value or values in a data set. For example, 4 is the mode of the set of numbers 0,4,4,2,5,1,4. That’s because 4 appears most.

*Bar Chart Analyis*:

The bar chart below displays Lesson 3’s Evidence on settler jobs in the early 1600’s. Use this bar chart to answer the questions.

@centered-image{jobs-1600s.png, "bar chart showing count of passengers reporting various job types. The talles bar is for farm-hand with over 25. Mid-size bars representing between 10 and 20 passengers include carpener, farmer, servant, and other. Other bars representing 2-4 passengers include baker, bookkeper, clergyman, laborer, messenger, shoemaker, smith and tailor."}

@n What job was the MODE according to the bar chart? @fitb{}{}

@n How many carpenters came in the early ships? @fitb{}{}

@n Which was more common—shoemakers or tailors? @fitb{}{}

@n Why do we use a bar chart for this data instead of a line chart?

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n The ships’ lists sometimes mentioned female passengers by name, but never included a job for them. Why do  you think jobs weren't reported for females?
