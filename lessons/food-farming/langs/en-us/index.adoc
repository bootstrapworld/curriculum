@description{Students explore the jobs of settlers and immigrant Americans at two points in history (and a third for homework). This comparison shows changes in numbers of farmers across American history, which is a key factor in changes in food production.}

| Students will be able to...

* create bar charts and identify the mode in a set of data to compare and contrast how immigrants’ jobs changed from the early 1600s to the late 1800s.
* understand what types of questions pie charts and bar charts are useful for.

== Review

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete the @printable-exercise{do-now.adoc}

Prompt students to complete a turn and talk to share answers with their neighbor.

Call on select students to share out while revealing correct answers under the document camera.

Yesterday, we looked at the bones found at different archaeological sites to discover what settlers ate. Then we created pie charts to see the differences between the modern American diet and that of Native Americans in the Northeast hundreds of years ago.

Before we move on, let’s find out what you discovered in your homework!

- How is your diet similar to or different from that of Native Americans?

Have a few students share out.

== What Jobs were common for Europeans who settled in the New York area in the early 1600s?

=== Overview

=== Launch

Turn to @printable-exercise{.adoc} Let’s read the directions together.

Students should work together to answer the questions using @opt-printable-exercise{evidence.adoc}.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
What type of display should we use—pie chart or line chart?
_A @vocab{bar chart} because job is a @vocab{categorical variable}._

15-17 minutes—Vocabulary:
Introduce new vocabulary and record with students into their notebooks.

A bar chart shows the number of times each value of a categorical variable appears in a data set. Bar charts help us see what’s the most frequent value of a categorical variable. This value is called the mode. To find the mode, just look for the category with the tallest bar.

The mode is the most common value in a data set. For example, 4 is the mode of the set of numbers 0,4,4,2,5,1,4. That’s because 4 appears most.

17-19 minutes—Chart Analysis:
Students work together to answer the questions at the bottom of the page.

19-20 minutes—Reveal Correct Answers:
Use doc cam and call on select students to reveal the correct answers.
20-22 minutes—Frame Challenge #2 and Introduce Vocab:
“It’s time for the second part of your assignment today. We are now going to journey to Ellis Island Immigration Museum to see if we can answer the question: What jobs were common for European settlers by the late 1800s? Turn to the next page and let’s read about this new challenge together.”

“Before we begin, you have one final vocabulary word for today: immigrant. An immigrant is a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country.” Students should copy this down in their notebooks.

Read page with students and go over the directions for chart creation. The teacher may choose to model how to create this or may let students figure it out on their own.

22-29 minutes—Chart Creation:
Students should log into Google Classroom to access this new data set. Students should work in pairs to create the chart and move to analysis when they are done. The teacher circulates and targets struggling students.

29-30 minutes—Reveal Correct Chart:
Pause class to stamp for understanding by revealing a correct bar chart. Then, prompt students to move to their analysis questions.
30-37 minutes—Work Time:
Students work in pairs to answer the questions.

37-40 minutes—Reveal Correct Answers:
Use doc cam and call on select students to reveal the correct answers.
40-44 minutes—Evidence Journal:
“It’s time to summarize your findings for today! We will end class this way every day and your answers will be used to give you a grade on how hard you worked as a reporter today. Make sure to restate the question, answer in complete sentences, and show what you know!

Turn to your evidence journal and begin: Between the early 1600s and the late 1800s, what changed and what stayed the same about the jobs of settlers and immigrants to America?”

44-45 minutes—Homework Overview:
“Tonight your homework is practice your bar chart skills by looking at data from modern times! Enjoy!”
