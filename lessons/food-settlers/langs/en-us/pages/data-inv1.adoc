= Data Investigation 1 (Farmed v Wild Protein)

How much of settlersâ€™ diets came from farm protein instead of wild protein? 

To find clues about what meat the early European settlers of the NY harbor ate, archeologists (scientists who study how people used to live) dug up the ground in several locations around what is now New York City. They looked at what kind of animal bones were found in each location. 


The first column in this table labels 5 individual locations studied (A, B, C, D, E). Each row is for one of those 5 locations.

@n Remember that a variable is a characteristic with number or category values. A variable can have different values for different individuals. Tables usually use a different column for each variable studied. What are the four variables whose values were studied for each location?

@n Are these four variables quantitative or categorical? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{quantitative}}

@n Use your evidence cards to complete the table. 

@n Does this data set support a claim that settlers ate more *farmed protein* or *wild protein*? How do you know?
