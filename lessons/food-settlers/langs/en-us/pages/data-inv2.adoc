Here is a table showing differences in foods eaten between Southern New England Native Americans in the 1600s and modern Americans. The table focuses on calories, which measure how much energy someone gets from eating a particular food. A ten-year-old needs fewer than 2000 calories a day. A grown man needs close to 2500.

@fitb{}{}

@n All calories are classified according to Food Group. Is Food Group a categorical or quantitative variable?

@fitb{}{}

@n Later in this lesson weâ€™ll make a pie chart showing the proportion of Native American calories in each food group. Which food group will take up the largest slice of the pie?
