The steps of the Design Recipe don't change just because we're working with Rows, but we can make some adjustments when using Row-consuming functions to filter tables and build columns! Let's try a concrete example:

@vspace{1ex}

_Write a function `is-lizard`, which tells us whether an animal is a lizard._

== Contract and Purpose

- We still want to pick good names. Are we writing a function to check if an animal is a lizard? Call it `is-lizard`!
- The Domain is a lot easier -- it's _always_ a `Row`!
- The Range is easier, too. If we're writing a function to filter a Table, we know the Range _has to be a Boolean_. (What would it be if we were building a column of Numbers? Images? Strings?)

== Examples

The goal of the Examples step is to _find the pattern_ that represents what the function does. When working with Rows, sometimes we have to start by just focusing on what the answer should be.


Suppose `animalC` is a lizard, and `animalD` is a cat. We can imagine the answers for an `is-lizard` to be...

```
examples:
	is-lizard(animalC) is true
	is-lizard(animalD) is false
end
```

But how do we know these are `true` and `false`? Well, we KNOW `animalC` is a lizard, and we KNOW `animalD` is a cat. So let's replace those answers with the Boolean expressions that compare their species:

```
examples:
	is-lizard(animalC) is "lizard" == "lizard"  # will produce true
	is-lizard(animalD) is "cat" == "lizard"     # will produce false
end
```

But what work gives us "lizard" and "cat"? Well, we can look in the `species` column!

```
examples:
	is-lizard(animalC) is animalC["species"] == "lizard" # will produce true
	is-lizard(animalD) is animalD["species"] == "lizard" # will produce false
end
```

Sometimes we can go straight to this final form, doing the whole thing in one step. But it's nice to know we can break it down into pieces if we have to.

Once we see the pattern, we can _circle and label what changes_. In this case, only the Row representing the animal changes! We might use `r` as label, to represent the Row.

== Definition
The final step in the Design Recipe is to take the pattern from our examples and _generalize it_ to work with any input. It's no different when working with Rows.

@vspace{1ex}

Once again, our previous step is a huge help. We can simply *copy everything that stays the same*, and replace the part that changes with the label we used:

```
fun is-lizard(r): r["species"] == "lizard" end
```
