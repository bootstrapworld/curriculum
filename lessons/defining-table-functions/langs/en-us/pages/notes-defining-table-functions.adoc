= The Design Recipe

Functions have multiple representations (e.g. - Contracts, Examples, and Definition), and each of these representations shows us a particular part of how the function should behave. By using these representations in a particular order - called the @vocab{Design Recipe} - we can build lots of functions, check our work, and document our thinking!

== Contract and Purpose Statement
The first step in the Design Recipe is to write the Contract. This means we have to be able to answer three questions:

- What is the *Name* of the function we are defining?
- What is the *Domain* of that function? (When dealing with Table Functions, the Domain is always `Row`)
- What is the *Range* of the function? (What is the type of the output?)

The Purpose Statement is a way of adding detail to the Contract, using plain human language. A good Purpose Statement should always explain:

- What the input _represents_. (Is it Animals? Schools? States?)
- What the output _represents_. (Pounds? True or false?)
- All the information necessary to go from input to output.

It's important to start with this representation, because it's the least detailed. If we can't answer _these_ questions, we shouldn't start writing code!

== Examples
The second step is work through some concrete examples, making sure that we know exactly what the function will do.

The goal of the Examples step is to _find the pattern_ that represents what the function does. Sometimes we have to start by just focusing on what the answer should be. Suppose `animalA` is a lizard animal, and `animalB` isn't. We can imagine the answers for an `is-lizard` to be...

```
examples:
	is-lizard(animalA) is true
	is-lizard(animalB) is false
end
```

But what work do we have to do to check if an animal is a lizard? (1) We *look up* the "species" column, and (2) ask if the value is equal to "lizard". We can write both of these steps in code, finishing the examples:

```
examples:
	is-lizard(animalA) is animalA["species"] == "lizard"
	is-lizard(animalB) is animalB["species"] == "lizard
end
```

(And sometimes we can go straight to showing our work, doing the whole thing in one step!)

Once we see the pattern, we can _circle and label what changes_. In this case, only the animal itself changes!

== Definition
The final step in the Design Recipe is to take the pattern from our examples and _generalize it_ to work with any input.

Once again, our previous step is a huge help: we can simply *copy everything that stays the same*, and replace the part that changes with the label we used:

```
fun is-lizard(r): r["species"] == "lizard" end
```
