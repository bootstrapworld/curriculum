= Possible Food-Related Causes of Health Problems


@description{This lesson explores the connections between what we eat and modern American health problems. Students explore four data sets about food access and consumption (access to fast food, distance to supermarkets, calorie consumption, and high fructose corn syrup consumption) and think about how these connect to the health problems discussed in the previous lesson. The goal is for students to relate food habits and health challenges.}

0-3 minutes—Do Now:
Students enter the classroom silently and complete their Do Now.

3-4 minutes—Pair-Share:
Prompt students to complete a Turn and Talk to share answers with their neighbor: “Before we begin, please share your answers with your neighbor.”

4-5 minutes—Share Out:
Call on select students to share out while revealing correct answers under the document camera. Reveal the correct line chart in the slides.

5-6 minutes—Recap the Unit and Yesterday:
“Welcome Back, New York Times reporters! Today, we will be diving into the seventh day of our Data Science Unit and remember we are attempting to discover the answers to our big unit questions: How has the way Americans get food changed from the time of early Native Americans up until now? Does the way we eat now seem better or worse than before?”

“Yesterday, we explored some of the possible side effects from this change in how we get our food and what we eat. We learned about the rise in diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure.”
6-8 minutes—Frame the Day:
“Today is your last day before we begin the final project. Your boss from the NYT has found some interesting datasets for you. We are going to be asking WHY! Why are these things happening? What are the potential causes of these bad health effects? How did the change in the way we get our food contribute to these health issues?”

“From our Do Now, we’ve already learned one potential cause. What was it? YES—FAST FOOD! Today, we are going to put your data science skills to the test. You are going to have 3 sets of challenges and each one will reveal another potential cause. We will do one together, you will do the other two on your own. By the end of today, you should be able to list all 4 potential causes of our health issues today. Do you have any guesses of what the other 3 might be?”

Allow a few students to share out! “Let’s find out!”

“Today, your editor from The New York Times has prepared 3 data sets for you to investigate before you think about what you’ll write in your final article.  We are going to break into groups today to analyze these data sets. We will do the first one together as a class, and then you will analyze the other two data sets with a partner. By the end of today, you should be able to tell me all four potential causes and then we will begin planning your final report! Let’s get started!”
8-18 minutes—Guided Analysis for Research Set A.
Teacher guides students to analyze the first research set (A) together.
Reveal exemplar charts.
18-25 minutes—Partner work for Research Set B.
Go over expectations: “You have 7 minutes to complete the background research, chart, and worksheet.”

Students work in partners to complete research Set B.

25-26 minutes—Share out:
Teacher uses computer/doc cam to check over final answers.
26-33 minutes—Partner work for Research Set C.
Students work in partners to complete research Set C.

33-34 minutes—Share out:
Teacher uses computer/doc cam to check over final answers.
34-35 minutes—Summarize it: “So, what are some of the potential causes of some of American’s unhealthy eating today?” Reveal the final causes using slides.

35-40 minutes—Project, Outline, and Brainstorm: “It’s now time to start on your final project. You have learned a TON this unit, and your final report is due to The New York Times tomorrow. Let’s review what is expected in your report and tonight your homework will be to draft your outline. When we come in to class tomorrow, we will get straight to typing, so you must give the assignment your all tonight. You will take your notebook home with you to complete it.”

Go over all project expectations.

Turn and Talk: “As you noticed, a part of your report requires you to give advice for Americans on how they can eat healthily. Based on what we learned today about these four big causes, what would you advise Americans to do differently?”

Have students turn and talk, and then share out. Teacher may choose to chart these items on chart paper for students to reference later.
40-45 minutes—Evidence Journal:
“Fantastic work. It’s time to summarize our findings for the last time this unit! You may work with your group to answer this evidence journal question.”

“Turn to your evidence journal and begin: We studied potential causes for America’s current health issues. Name 3-4 of the potential causes. Then, come up with at least one solution you would like to propose for how Americans can beat these problems!”
Complete the outline.
