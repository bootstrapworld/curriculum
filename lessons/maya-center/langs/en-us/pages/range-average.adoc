@vocab{range}:  the difference between the lowest and highest values in a data set

@vspace{1ex}

Sometimes, when we have a table with both a @vocab{categorical} variable and a @vocab{quantitative} one, a data scientist will check whether the quantitative variableâ€™s values seem to be affected by what category the individual falls in. 

@vspace{1ex}

@n Fill in the following table about Year and Corn:

[cols="1a, 2a, 2a, 2a, 2a"]
|===
| Year:
| *Average Proportion of Corn in Diet:*
| Lowest Proportion of Corn in Diet:
| Highest Proportion of Corn in Diet:
| *Range of Proportion of Corn in Diet*

| Before 900 AD
| @ifsoln{0.5025}
| @ifsoln{0.42}
| @ifsoln{0.62}
| @ifsoln{0.2}

| 900-1000 AD
| @ifsoln{0.3156666666667}
| @ifsoln{0.25}
| @ifsoln{0.4}
| @ifsoln{0.15}
|===

@n What observations can you make about corn consumption based on the table above?  

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The ancient Maya ate a significantly lower proportion of corn after 900AD.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The highest proportion of corn in the diet after 900AD was lower than the lowest proportion before 900AD.}}

@n What might have happened to cause a change in the amount of corn the Maya ate?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There was less corn? They had to share the corn they had with more people?}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It got harder to grow corn? People were less interested in farming? They ate more of other foods?}}
