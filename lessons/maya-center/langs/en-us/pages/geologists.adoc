For a more complete picture of the situation over the past several thousand years, some geologists considered three things that happened at the same time in a part of Guatemala where the ancient Maya once lived.
|
First, the geologists recorded how much soil eroded (washed away) to get an idea of how many trees were being cut down. It is known that cutting down trees leads to soil erosion. The geologists saw that the highest level of tree removal happened in the period building up to the time when the ancient Maya civilization collapsed in 900-1000 AD.
|
Second, the geologists noted population densities around the region that they studied. The number of people kept growing through the “Preclassic” period, hit a peak, and then began to drop dramatically around the year 900. In other words, the population continued to grow until around year 900 when population began to steeply decline.
|
Third, they measured pollen that comes from inedible grasses and weeds, not edible crops or trees. The pollen of these inedible grasses and weeds was at an all-time high when the ancient Maya civilization collapsed.
|
Taken together, the three types of data all point to the same explanation: When the ancient Maya population expanded, they cut down too many trees, soil washed away and weed pressure increased. There wasn’t enough food for all those people to eat, and they began to die out.
