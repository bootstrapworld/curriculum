Here again is the line chart about changes in population size for two groups.

@centered-image{line-chart.png, line chart comparing populations of Native Americans and non-Native Americans from 1500 to 1750}

Use the chart to answer the following questions:

@n In roughly what year was the number of Native Americans about twice as much as the number of Non-native Americans: 1710, 1730, or 1750?

@fitb{}{}

@n When was the population size about the same for the two groups? 1710, 1730, or 1750?

@fitb{}{}

@n Did the number of Native Americans decrease more between 1500 and 1650 or between 1650 and 1750?

@fitb{}{}

@n Which of these events seems most likely to have caused changes seen in the chart from 1500 to 1650?

a) the European settlers ran out of food and starved
b) the European settlers who came in the 1500s brought new diseases that infected Native Americans
c) European settlers and Native Americans fought and killed one another in large numbers

@n Why did you pick that option?
