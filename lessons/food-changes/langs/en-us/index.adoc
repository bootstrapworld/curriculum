= Changes in Populations and Jobs in the United States

@description{Students use maps and line charts to observe the growing number of settlers and immigrants (and subsequent decline of Native American population), which suggests non-Native American ways of food production were spreading. }

=== Investigate

=== Synthesize

0-3 minutes—Do Now:
Students enter the classroom silently and complete their Do Now.

3-4 minutes—Pair-Share:
Prompt students to complete a Turn and Talk to share answers with their neighbor: “Before we begin, please share your answers with your neighbor.”

4-5 minutes—Share Out:
Call on select students to share out while revealing correct answers under the document camera.
Teacher note: the thing to point out here is that "farm hand" and "farmer" could be combined when thinking about the proportion working on farms. Students will likely need to be taught what "farm hand" means.

5-7 minutes—Recap the Unit and Yesterday:
“Welcome Back, New York Times reporters! Today, we will be diving into the fourth day of our Data Science Unit and remember we are attempting to discover the answers to our big unit questions: How has the way Americans get food changed from the time of early Native Americans up until now? Does the way we eat now seem better or worse than before?”

“Yesterday, we looked at the jobs the early settlers had when they came to New Amsterdam and the jobs immigrants had about 250 years later when they arrived at Ellis Island. We saw that even in this 250 year span, jobs didn’t change very much. Roughly half of our sample of immigrants came as farmers (and half the U.S. population were farmers) … which gives us a clue about where the food was coming from back in the day!”
7-9 minutes—Homework Check:
“Before we move on, let’s see how you did on your homework!”

Reveal correct answers quickly under the document camera while calling on selected students.

“Awesome! We will continue to use your graphing skills today!
9-10 minutes—Frame the Day:
“Today you have received TWO assignments from the NY Times office. First, we are going to head to the Native American History Museum to find out the answer to the following question:

How did land ownership and populations (Native vs. Settler or Immigrant) change over time in America?

Let’s begin!”
10-12 minutes—Background Knowledge and Directions:
“Your first challenge today is going to be a map challenge. Let’s find out what our task is by reading the directions together.” Read aloud the directions with students or have other students read.

12-16 minutes—Map Sort and Answer Questions:
Students work in pairs to sort the maps and record their observations. Teacher circulates and assists groups.

16-17 minutes—Reveal answers and Stamp for Understanding:
Showcall exemplar student work or reveal answers under the document camera for the Map Sort portion.

17-22 minutes—Video of American Land Ownership:
“To get a better understanding of how land was occupied in North America throughout history, let’s watch a quick movie that shows how these maps changed over time. The years keep advancing and colors keep changing so we will be able to watch who occupied what land, and when.”

Play Video

22-24 minutes—Stamp for Final Question:
Call on students to share their thoughts for the final question: Was anyone living in the parts of the maps that are colored white? If so, who? (Native Americans were!)

“We saw that by modern times, almost no white areas of the map are left. What do you think that means for the Native American populations that lived there?” Allow students to turn and talk and then share out.

“Let’s find out by looking at the statistics of Native American population changes during this time.”
24-26 minutes—Frame Activity and Directions:
“We are about to take a look at some line charts to learn more about what happened to the Native Americans. Before we do, let’s remember what we learned about line charts in our last unit.”

“In our unit on the Maya civilization, we referred to a simple line chart that showed the basic trend in Maya population size. The number of Maya people increased steeply from their beginnings until around the year 900. Then it decreased dramatically over the next 100 years, until there were very few Maya left in the year 1000.  After that the population size climbed a bit to reach what it is now, about 5 million.”

“Now, let’s apply what we know about line charts to Native Americans. Turn to the next page in your packet.”

Teacher reads aloud: “The following line chart shows changes in the Native American and non-Native American populations in the United States from the time European settlers began to arrive until 250 years later.” With your partner, use your data science skills to answer the questions on this page. You have 3 minutes.

26-29 minutes—Student Work Time:
Students work together to answer questions.

29-30 minutes—Reveal correct answers:
Use student work to showcall or uncover answers on the Doc Cam. Allow students to share their thoughts out for the final question.
30-32 minutes—Framing the activity:
Use slides 6-10 to set the stage for the activity:

Slide 9: “Let’s recap what we’ve discovered so far: Things changed from land mostly occupied by Native Americans to land mostly owned by European settlers. By the 1750s, Native and settler populations were almost equal. The Native American population was decreasing. The European settler population was increasing.”

Slide 10: “But what happened from then until today?” Show graph and allow students to share out what the graph shows. “The US population grew tremendously! It is now 327 million people. Native Americans make up only 1/50 of this population (about 6 million people).”

Slide 11: “So, for your second assignment in class today, you are going to head to the U.S. Department of Labor to research the following question: How have changes in population and land ownership affected the jobs people have today?”

Slide 12: “And we’ve seen charts of immigrant jobs in the 1800s. Most of our sampled immigrants were farmers.”

Slide 13: “Now your challenge is to use data of more recent immigrant jobs to create a pie chart, draw it on paper, and answer the questions. Let’s see if people are still coming to America to farm. You may work with a partner and you have five minutes to build your pie chart and answer all questions.”

32-38 minutes—Student Work Time:
Students work together while the teacher circulates.

38-40 minutes—Share out:
Reveal final pie charts and use document camera to reveal the correct answers. Call on students to share out as you go.

“But wait… if fewer people are farmers now (less than 4% of recent immigrants), then where is our food coming from today? Who is making it if we have so few farmers? We will investigate this tomorrow!”
40-44 minutes—Evidence Journal:
It’s time to summarize your findings for today! We will end class this way every day and your answers will be used to give you a grade on how hard you worked as a reporter today. Make sure to restate the question, answer in complete sentences, and show what you know!

Turn to your evidence journal and begin: From the late 1800s to 2002, what changed about food-based jobs of immigrants to America?

44-45 minutes—Homework Overview:
Tonight your homework is to practice your line chart skills by taking a closer look at changing population sizes. Enjoy!
