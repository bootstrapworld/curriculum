= Collaboration

@description{Students practice using the Design Recipe through a variety of collaborative exercises that allow them to interact with each other's work and receive feedback from peers, ultimately helping them to internalize the importance of attending to precision at each step of the way.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Understand how to use the @vocab{Design Recipe} to break down simple word problems.
* Create a strong @vocab{purpose statement} that details in their own words what the @vocab{function} is doing.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use the Design Recipe to break down word problem when writing a function.
* I can identify @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and other quantities in a word problem when writing a function.
* I can create and revise a strong purpose statement that explains what the function is doing.

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|

* The purpose statement, like the contract, is a comment - something that the computer doesn't read.  It's important for readability of their code - there may be other people looking at their code and using their functions!
* The domain and range of a function are described as @vocab{data types}, such as Number, String, or Image.
* This activity can work well as a formative review.
* This activity is a good time to get students working with someone other than their usual coding partner.

== Design Recipe Telephone

* Divide the class into groups of three.
* Choose three word problems (_we'll call them Problems A, B and C_) to give to each group.
** Option 1: These three DR problems on image composition.
** Option 2: These three DR problems on ...
** Option 2: Any of the practice word problems in the workbook that students haven't solved before.
* In every group, each student is given their own word problem. Student 1 writes the Contract and Purpose for Problem A, Student 2 writes the Contract and Purpose for Problem B, and so on.
* Once they're done, students should get rid of the word problems by handing them back to the teacher, folding them over, etc. Then they pass their paper to the right so that Student 1 is now looking at the Contract and Purpose for Problem C, Student 2 is looking at the Contract and Purpose for Problem A, and Student 3 is looking at Problem B.
* Based _solely on the Contract and Purpose_, each student must now write two Examples, as well as circle and label what is changing. If the Contract and Purpose don't provide enough information, they pass the paper back and the original author has to re-do them.
* Once they're done, students get rid of the Contract and Purpose by folding them over. Then they they pass their paper to the right _again_, so that Student 1 is now looking at the Examples for Problem B, Student 2 is looking at the Contract and Purpose for Problem C, and Student 3 is looking at Problem A.
* Based _solely on the Examples_ (and the circles-and-labeled variables), students must derive the function definition. If the Examples don't provide enough information, they pass the paper back and the original author has to re-do them.

This activity can be repeated several times, or done as a timed competition between teams. The goal is to emphasize that each step - if done correctly - makes the following step incredibly simple.

=== Common Misconceptions
Mathematically confident students will _actively resist_ these activities, because they may be used to having the answer come to them almost as soon as they finish reading the word problem (this is the same objection those students have to explaining  "how they got the answer").

=== Synthesize
The Design Recipe is a way of slowing down and thinking through each step of a problem. If we already know how to get the answer, why would it ever be important to know how to do each step the slow way?

_Sample Responses:_

- Someday we won't be able to get the answer, and knowing the steps will help
- So we can help someone else who is stuck
- So we can work with someone else and share our thinking
- So we can check our work

== Where'd You Get That?

Divide the class into pairs, giving each pair two word problems (the whole class can use the same set, or different ones), and have students solve one problem each _independently_. Once finished, students take turns _challenging each other_. The Challenger always starts at the *bottom* of the page, physically pointing to one part of the function definition and asking "where'd you get that?" The Defender has to _physically point_ to some location in the Examples, and explain exactly how they got that part of the definition. This is repeated for every other step in the recipe, as students work their way back to the original word problem. For example:

- *Challenger* (pointing at variable in the Definition): Where'd you get that?
- *Defender* (pointing at label in the Examples): Well, I circled the parts of the Examples that change, and gave them that label.
- *Challenger* (pointing at the label): OK, but where did you get the label?
- *Defender* (pointing at Purpose Statement): I used that term in the Purpose Statement.
- *Challenger* (pointing at Purpose Statement): Where'd you get that term?
- *Defender* (pointing to Word Problem): I got it from reading the Word Problem.


=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Have students break into teams of 2-4, and use the Design Recipe to solve at least three word problems. We recommend using some of the sample word problems provided in the workbook (see below), but you can also grab any word problem from your math book in which students must define a functional relationship.

*Optional:* Ask students to create their own appropriately challenging word problem (with a solution) and collect the responses for later use as "Do Now" tasks or formative assessment.

=== Synthesize

Which step in the Design Recipe are students feeling the most confident about? The least? At this stage, it is normal for students to feel most confident about the Contract and Examples, and the least confident about Purpose Statements and Definitions.
