= CODAP Exploration

The purpose of this exploration is to familiarize yourself with some of CODAP's features - first tables, then graphs. Feel free to experiment and try things out! Make sure youâ€™re logged into the @starter-file{animals} in CODAP.

== Tables in CODAP

- Move the table to a different location on the screen.

- Minimize the table. (Hint: Try hovering your mouse over the table's title. What appears?)

- Now re-expand the minimized table.

- Add a row to the table.

- Delete that row of the table.

- Move the `Age` column so that it is between `Fixed` and `Legs.`

- Delete a column of the table.

- Close the table. Can you get it back? (Hint: A drop-down menu appears when you click on "Tables" in the upper left.)

- Create a new attribute. Is the column populated or empty? @fitb{15em}{@ifsoln{Empty.}}

- Name your new attribute `test`.

== Graphs in CODAP

- See if you can make a graph. What did you select in order to do so? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{I clicked on the "Graph" icon in the upper left-hand corner of my screen}}

_Note: When you first make a graph, the points are randomly positioned!_

- Click on a dot. What happens?

- Can you figure out a way to make _different_ information appear when you click on a dot? (Hint: You may need to move a column!)

- Drag an attribute (like `Weight`, `Name`, or `Sex`) to the graph's axis - or use the drop-down menu that appears when you click on an axis.

- Can you make the graph show _two_ attributes?

- Once the graph shows two attributes, can you revert it back to a graph with one attribute?

- What do you notice about the difference between graphs with one attribute and graphs with two attributes?
