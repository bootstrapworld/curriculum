Let's say we want to predict what each animal will weigh if its weight doubles. We could take out a calculator, or do some computations with paper and pencil! Fill in the portion of the Animals table below, computing each animal's weight, doubled.

It would be quite time-consuming to do this for the entire table! Instead, we can input expressions and functions that use attributes as variables. To tell CODAP to triple the weight, we would input `Pounds * 2` into our `Edit Formula` box. "Pounds" automatically appears in pink, because CODAP recognizees that is an attribute on the table.

@n Open the @starter-file{animals} and see if you can think of other scenarios where it would be useful to enter an expression or function in CODAP.
- Compare your results with the first table, above.

@n Edit the `test` column's formula so that 2 weeks are added to the time to adoption for all of the animals. What formula did you use?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_`Time to adoption (weeks)` + 2_}}

== Applying Functions

In order to answer each of the questions below, you must first select `test` in @starter-file{animals}, and then choose `Edit formula` from the drop-down menu that appears. You will be typing into the `Edit Formula` box.

- Enter `sqrt(16)` into the `Edit Formula` box.

@n How many arguments does `sqrt` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_1_}}

@n What type of argument does the function expect? (Number? String? Boolean?) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number._}}

@n What type of output does `sqrt` produce? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number._}}

@n What did the function evaluate to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_4_}}

- Now, enter `sqrt(Weight)`.

@n What do you observe? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's weight_}}

@n What happens when you enter `sqrt(Legs)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's legs for `sqrt(Legs)`._}}

@n What about `sqrt(Name)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP produces an error message because it cannot find the square root of a string, only a number._}}

- Enter `stringLength(Name)` into the `test` column.

@n What do you observe? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{__7 appears, CODAP finds the amount of letters in each animal's name__}}

@n How many arguments does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_1_}}

@n What type of argument does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_String_}}

@n Does `stringLength` produce a Number? String? Boolean? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number_}}

== Putting it all together

- Create a column called `age-next-year` that uses an expression to add one year to each animalâ€™s age.

- Create a column called `rounded-weight` that uses a function to give the weight of each animal rounded to the nearest whole number.

- Create a column called `old` that uses a Boolean to indicate which animals are over 5 years old.
