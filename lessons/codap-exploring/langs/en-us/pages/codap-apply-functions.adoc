@n Open your @starter-file{animals}. Edit the `test` column's formula to compute __triple__ the weight of all of the animals. What formula will you use?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_`Weight (lbs)` * 3_}}

- Compare your results with the first table, above.

@n Edit the `test` column's formula so that 2 weeks are added to the time to adoption for all of the animals. What formula did you use?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_`Time to adoption (weeks)` + 2_}}

== Applying Functions

In order to answer each of the questions below, you must first select `test` in @starter-file{animals}, and then choose `Edit formula` from the drop-down menu that appears. You will be typing into the `Edit Formula` box.

- Enter `sqrt(16)` into the `Edit Formula` box.

@n How many arguments does `sqrt` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_1_}}

@n What type of argument does the function expect? (Number? String? Boolean?) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number._}}

@n What type of output does `sqrt` produce? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number._}}

@n What did the function evaluate to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_4_}}

- Now, enter `sqrt(Weight)`.

@n What do you observe? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's weight_}}

@n What happens when you enter `sqrt(Legs)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP finds the square root of each animal's legs for `sqrt(Legs)`._}}

@n What about `sqrt(Name)`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_CODAP produces an error message because it cannot find the square root of a string, only a number._}}

- Enter `stringLength(Name)` into the `test` column.

@n What do you observe? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{__7 appears, CODAP finds the amount of letters in each animal's name__}}

@n How many arguments does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_1_}}

@n What type of argument does `stringLength` expect? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_String_}}

@n Does `stringLength` produce a Number? String? Boolean? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Number_}}

== Putting it all together

- Create a column called `age-next-year` that uses an expression to add one year to each animal’s age.

- Create a column called `rounded-weight` that uses a function to give the weight of each animal rounded to the nearest whole number.

- Create a column called `old` that uses a Boolean to indicate which animals are over 5 years old.
