= More Transformers: Sort
@description{Students learn about filltering  - manually, deleting one row at a time, or by using a _Transformer_ to build and modify a copy of the table.}

== Sorting @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students _change a table,_ sorting it by a particular column. Then, students learn a new and more dynamic way of sorting... with the Sort Transformer!

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open the @starter-file{animals} in CODAP.
- How many animals' names start with the letter S?
** _Once you notice students deep in concentration, looking for and tallying animals with S-names, move on to the next question..._
- What would make it easier to figure out how many animals' names start with the letter S?

Explain to students that, in this lesson, they will learn two ways of sorting. The first way is to actually alter the original table. The second way is to create a transformed copy of the original table, which automatically has the animals sorted.

[.lesson-instruction]
- When manipulating data, what do you think might be some advantages and disadvantages to changing the actual table?
** _Advantage: It's quick, easy and intuitive. Disadvantage: If I want to refer to the previous arrangement of animals for any reason... it might no longer exist._
- What are some advantages and disadvantages to creating a new modified table?
** _Advantage: I will be able to refer back to my old table, and maybe even compare the new table with the old table._

You will direct students to sort various columns on the table by clicking the attribute name and then selecting from the drop-down menu either `Sort Ascending` or `Sort Descending`. This will modify the original table.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Let's sort the animals alphabetically by name and see if we get the same answer as we did before! _(The image below shows where to click to sort the animals alphabetically by name.)_
@centered-image{images/sort-ascending-by-name.png, 450}
- Can you sort the animals by age, from youngest to oldest?
- How about from heaviest to lightest?
- Now sort the animals table by how long it took for each animal to be adopted, in ascending order.

=== Investigate

Let's try sorting with a Transformer!

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete the @printable-exercise{pages/codap-sort-transformer.adoc} worksheet, which will walk you through creating, applying, and saving a `Sort` Transformer.

Initially, students might question the value of using a Transformer to sort. This is okay! The sort functionality embedded into CODAP is, in fact, a more efficient choice for some purposes. Again, encourage students to experiment with all of the functionality that the Transformers offer; invite them to be curious and playful as they work, to consider the possibilities afforded by Transformers. For instance, why might it be useful to name and save a Transformer?

=== Synthesize

- Does the Transformer `Sort` produce a _new_ table, or change the existing one?
** _The `Sort` Transformer produceds a new, modified copy of the original table._
- You've now learned two different strategies for sorting a column of a table. What do the two strategies have in common? How are they different?
** _Transformers can be named and saved for future use. Transformers create a modified copy of a table rather than altering the original dataset._
- When would it be better to use the `Sort` Transformer to make a new Table, instead of changing the table? When might it be worse?
** _If we are experimenting with a dataset and want to preserve the original table, it would make more sense to use a Transformer._
