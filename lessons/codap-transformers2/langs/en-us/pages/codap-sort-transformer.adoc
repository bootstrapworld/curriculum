== Creating a Sort Transformer

@n We're going to create a Transformer to sort the animals alphabetically by name. Select Sort from the drop-down menu.

@n What would be a good name for a Transformer that organizes the table alphabetically by animals' names? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{order-by-name.}}

_Type in that name._

@n Which dataset do you want CODAP to apply this Transformer to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Animals Dataset}}

_Select it from the drop-down menu._

@n Recall what we're trying to do here - organiize the table alphabetically by name. Which attribute should we sort by? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{name}}

@n Which direction will you select? Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{"Ascending" sorts from A to Z, so I will select that.}}

@n You may have noticed that this Transformer does not require a contract or purpose statement! Why do you think that is?

== Applying and Saving the Sort Transformer

@n Apply the Transformer. What happens?

@ifsoln{A copy of the original dataset is created.}

@ifnotsoln{
@fitb{}{}
}
@vspace{1ex}

@n What do you notice about the name of the new dataset?

@ifsoln{It has the Transformer's customized name at the front, with the name of the original dataset in parentheses.}

@ifnotsoln{
@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}
}
@vspace{1ex}

@n What happens when you save a Transformer?

@ifsoln{When I save a Transformer, a small box appears that has my Transformer's name at the top. I will now be able to use the Transformer again, without inputting all of the different specifications.}

@ifnotsoln{
@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}
}
@vspace{1ex}

@n How is saving a Transformer different from saving a dataset?

@ifsoln{Saving a dataset saves the table, but not the operations performed on it. Saved tables appear on the drop-down menu of datasets to transform. Saving a transformer lets us re-use an operation.}
