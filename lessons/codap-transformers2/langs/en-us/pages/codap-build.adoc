@n Choose Build Attribute from the drop-down menu.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Enter `build-is-heavy` as the name. What does this name tell you about the Transformer we are creating?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are going to build a column that states `true` for heavy animals and `false` for lightweight animals.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Select the dataset you'd like to transform.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's name our new attribute `Heavy`.

@vspace{1ex}

@star What happens to the starred text when you name the attribute?

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Ensure that the collection you are adding to is "cases."

@vspace{1ex}

@n A domain is provided (row), but not a range. What is the desired output for `build-is-heavy`?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's write a purpose statement. What do we want a Transformer called `build-is-heavy` to do?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`build-is-heavy` consumes a weight and returns `true` if the weight is greater than a specified amount.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Enter `Weight > 40` as the expression.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Apply the Transformer. To define the Transformer for future use, select `Save`.

== More Building

@n Now, try creating a Transformer called `updated-age`. This Transformer will give the animals' ages one year from today. How many animals are 9 years-old one year from today?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In one year, there are three animals that are 9 years-old.}}
