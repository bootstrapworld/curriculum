== Create, Apply, and Save a Build Attribute Transformer (Step by Step)

@n Choose Build Attribute from the drop-down menu.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Enter `build-is-heavy` as the name. What does this name tell you about the Transformer we are creating?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It will build a column that states `true` for heavy animals and `false` for lightweight animals.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Select the dataset you'd like to transform.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Let's name our new attribute `Heavy`. What happened to the starred text (left) when you named the attribute?

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Ensure that the collection you are adding to is "cases."

@vspace{1ex}

@n A domain is provided (row), but not a range. What is the desired output for `build-is-heavy`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Write a purpose statement. What do we want the expression to do?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Consume a weight and return `true` if the weight is greater than a specified amount.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Enter `Weight > 40` as the expression.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Apply the Transformer. To define the Transformer for future use, select `Save`.

== More Building (On Your Own)

@n Now, try creating a Transformer called `updated-age`. This Transformer will give the animals' ages one year from today. How many animals are 9 years-old one year from today?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Three animals.}}

@n Use a Transformer to build a column that indicates the number of letters in each animal's name. How many animals have exactly eight letters in their name?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are five animals with eight letters in their name.}}

@n Now, use a Transformer and build a column that returns `true` if the number of letter's in an animal's name is less than or equal to five.  Which dataset will you need to add the attribute to? Why?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I'll need to use the dataset that I created in the previous step - otherwise my column with number of letters won't be included!}}

@fitb{}{}
