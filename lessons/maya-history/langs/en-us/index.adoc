= Ancient Maya History and Culture

@description{In this lesson students will use maps, timelines, primary documents from Spanish missionaries, a report from an archaelogical dig, Maya hieroglyphs, and a community survey to begin to build a framework for learning about ancient Maya society.}

== The Rise and Fall of the Ancient Maya Civilization @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview

Students will consider a map of the region settled by the ancient Maya, brainstorm reasons why civilizations might collapas and reflect on a timeline of the ancient Maya civilization.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students complete the @printable-exercise{map.adoc}.

=== Investigate

A few thousand years before Europeans began settling the northeast corner of North America, the highly sophisticated Maya civilization took root throughout most of the region that is now Mexico and Central America. At its peak, around 20 million Maya people lived in highly advanced cities.  They had a written language, a number system, a calendar, an understanding of astronomy (the positions of stars, planets, etc.), and a religion. Then, suddenly, about a thousand years ago, their population dwindled and their cities collapsed.

[.lesson-instruction]
Imagine if 9 out of every 10 people living in our cities just disappeared! How many people would be left in this classroom?!

* _For a quick kinesthetic visualization, have everyone stand. Direct them to count off... and sit down as they say their number unless they are number 10, 20, 30 or 40... eg 1 to 9 sit down... 10 stays standing... 11 to 19 sit down... 20 stays standing..._
* _Alternatively, divide the number of the people in the room by 10._

[.lesson-instruction]
What are some reasons why a population might suddenly decline so dramatically?

Brainstorm a list as a class and record your ideas somewhere that you can refer back to. We will keep returning to this question over time.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{timeline.adoc} and answer the questions.

_Note that population sizes over the past three thousand years can only be educated guesses because until recently there was no such thing as Census data for the Maya._

=== Synthesize

Based on what you now know about the ancient Maya, what do you think are some possible reasons as to why the ancient Maya civilization declined so suddenly?

== What Records Remain?

=== Overview

Students will hear written accounts of the Maya from Spanish missionaries in the 1540s and consider their points of view. They will also try to match Maya images of their gods to descriptions of them.

=== Launch

After Cortés conquered the Aztecs in the early 1500s, the Spanish moved to the Yucatán. This created major conflict between the Spanish and the Maya, who, though not nearly as numerous or powerful as they used to be, had a uniquely sophisticated civilization in the Americas.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
* Turn to @printable-exercise{spanish-on-maya.adoc} and follow along as I read the description of the Maya written by Diego de Landa, a Spanish missionary who worked in the Yucatán in the 1500s.
* Take a minute to discuss question 1 with your partner and record your thinking.
* Now follow along as I read the reflections of another Spanish missionary, Bartolomé de Las Casas, on the Maya.
* With your partner, complete the remaining questions.
* When you're done, turn to @printable-exercise{gods.adoc} and see if you can match the descriptions of the Maya gods to the images provided.

There are different ways to define the word “Historic.” One of its meanings has to do with whether or not there are written records from a time period. This definition explains why experts on the Maya civilization (which starts with “Pre-Classic” in about 1250 BCE) use the word “Historic” for the period beginning in 1520. This is referring to records written by the Spanish, not by the Maya.

[.lesson-instruction]
Do you think it makes sense to designate the Historic period of the Maya beginning in 1520, when the Spanish began writing about them? Why or why not?

// I'm not sure about this next paragraph. We have written accounts from the Spanish just like we have written accounts from British colonists... neither is a written account from the people themselves...
//

To get data about Native Americans and settlers in the Northeast, scientists can rely heavily on written sources, such as books containing individual people’s reports on their dealings with the Native Americans, as well as records like ships’ logs and town ledgers about the colonists who came from Europe.

[.lesson-instruction]
How do we learn about societies like the Maya, whose @vocab{hieroglyphic} writings were not only difficult to decipher, but were also almost completely destroyed during the Spanish invasion in the 1500s?

@vocab{Archaeology} is the study of physical remains and the things that people made, used, and left behind. By analyzing data about the Maya provided by archaeologists, we can solve many of the mysteries of their civilization.

In modern day, archaeologists have learned a lot about the ancient Maya civilization from uncovering human remains in underground caves called cenotes, which were believed to be holy sites. Archaeologists currently believe that human remains were from human sacrifice to various gods.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{research-on-maya.adoc} and take turns reading the text with your partner. Then answer the questions.

=== Synthesize

* How do we learn about societies like the ancient Maya, whose @vocab{hieroglyphic} writings were not only difficult to decipher, but were also almost completely destroyed during the Spanish invasion in the 1500s?
* What theories do you have for why the Maya empire collapsed? List at least 3 and star the one you believe in the most!

== Homework

One way that Data Scientists collect data is through surveys.

Turn to the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BbKKGXXWbSbVmKa42qMIJTQzSKnm27CEQqdSbianXiY/edit?usp=sharing, What do we know about the ancient Maya? Survey}

For practice, survey your partner, circling their responses in R1.

For homework tonight, each student will survey 5 people who are older than they are (parents, older siblings, other relatives, neighbors, etc.) to see what they know or think about the Maya.

Each person's answers will get recorded in a different column: R2... R6.
