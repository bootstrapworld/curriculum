= Maya Gods

What does the writing on the stone carvings mean?  In 1904 an archaeologist named Paul Schellhas began deciphering the Maya codices, assigning a new letter to each new God he found. Many of the Gods' names are now known, but archaeologists still sometimes use the Schellhas letter system. Below are the first 5. But which is which?

_Study the images and try to draw a line to match each name and symbol to a description._
