# Surface Area

Open the @starter-file{prism}, click Run and type `prism` into the Interactions Area.

Notice that the faces and edges of the prism are labeled. 

_Faces are the shapes on the outside of the figure._

_Edges are the line segments where the faces of solid figures meet in each of the three dimensions._ 

__How would you describe the faces of this prism?__

# Surface Area

You are going to work through this file, reading the commented code for instructions.

Take special note of line 22.

It reads `lst = [list: front, ]`, which defines `lst` to be a list of values.

This list should include all of the faces of the prism.  Right now it only includes `front`. 

Be sure to save a copy of this file!

# Surface Area

1. Open your saved file, and click Run to get an image of all the faces of the prism. 

1. Print them, cut them out, and use them to help you find the surface area of the prism: the total area of the faces covering the outside of the prism.

1. Tape these faces together to build the prism!

1. Complete task 2 in your file, defining surface-area to calculate the area of the prism using width, length and height.
