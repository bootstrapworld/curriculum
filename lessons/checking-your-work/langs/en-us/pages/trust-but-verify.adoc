= “Trust, but verify ...”

A “helpful” Data Scientist gives you access to the following functions:

@show{(contract
  "fixed-cats" '("Table") "Table"
  "consumes a table of animals, and produces a table containing only cats that have been fixed, sorted from youngest-to-oldest"
)}

You can use the function, _but you can’t see the code for it!_ *How do you know if you
can trust their code?*

*HINT:*

- You could make a _verification subset_ that contains one of every species, and make sure that the function filters out everything but cats.

- You could make sure this subset has multiple cats not already ordered of youngest-to-oldest, and make sure the function puts them in the right order.

1) What other qualities would this subset need to have?

@span{.blankline}{
  @ifsoln{It should contain animals - especially cats - that are fixed and unfixed}
}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

2) Create your verification subset! In the space below, list the name of each animal in
your subset.
