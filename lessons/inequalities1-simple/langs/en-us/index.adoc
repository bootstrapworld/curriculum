| Key Points for the Facilitator
|* A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images.  But unlike those types, there are only _two_ values: `true` and `false`. While simple to explain, this different behavior can be confusing for some students.
* Boolean-producing functions are essentially yes-or-no questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
* For example, `odd?` and `even?` (pronounced "odd-huh?" and "even-huh?" in Scheme) are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `odd?` and `even?`.
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
* For example, `is-odd`, `is-even` are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `is-odd` and `is-even`.

== Introducing Booleans @duration{20 minutes}

=== Launch
Students should be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }

Ask students to evaluate Circles of Evaluation for simple expressions they've seen before, and ask them to convert them into code.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(+ 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(- 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(* 8 0))}

Then show them unfamiliar Circles of Evaluation, and ask them to hypothesize what they think they mean, what they will evaluate to, and what the code would look like.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(> 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(< 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(= 8 0))}

Have students convert these Circles to code and type them in. What did they evaluate to? What do they think the outputs mean?

Values like `true` and `false` obviously aren't Numbers or Images. But they also aren't Strings, or else they would have quotes around them. We've found a __new data type__, called a @vocab{Boolean}.

- Explore the five functions in this starter file: `odd?`, `even?`, `less-than-one?`, `continent?`, `primary-color?`
- All five functions produce @vocab{Booleans}. Through your exploration, see if you can come up with an explanation of what a @vocab{Boolean} is.

[.lesson-point]
A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images. But unlike the others there are only two values: `true` and `false`.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{boolean-functions.adoc} and use the starter file to complete the questions, identifying inputs that will make each function produce `true`, and inputs that will make each function `false`.

=== Synthesize
- Students will see functions on this page that they've never encountered before! But instead of answering their questions, encourage them to make a _guess_ about what they do, and then type it in to discover for themselves.
- Explicitly point out that _everything they know still works!_ They can use their reasoning about Circles of Evaluation and Contracts to figure things out.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Many students - especially traditionally high-achieving ones - will be very concerned about writing examples that are "wrong." The misconception here is that an expression that produces `false` is somehow _incorrect_. You can preempt this in advance, by explaining that our Boolean-producing functions _should sometimes return false_.

== Introducing Inequalities @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover (or expand their understanding of) inequalities by identifying solutions and non-solutions and connecting expressions to graphic representations.

Equations typically have finite solution sets: there's only one answer for an unknown, or perhaps several answers. Inequalities, on the other hand, can have _infinite_ solutions.  Inequality expressions divide all of the numbers in the universe into two categories: solutions and non-solutions.  It is important that students are able to recognize that there are many possible solutions and non-solutions to an inequality and that they can identify whether or not a given number is or isn't part of the solution set.

This starter file includes a special `inequality` function that takes in a function, __which tests numbers in an inequality__, a list of 8 numbers __(to test in the function)__, and plots the numbers and a graph of the inequality on a number line.

[.lesson-point]
The solution set is shaded in blue, with points shaded green (solution) and red (non-solution).

The resulting plot shows the number line, with all solution values shaded in blue. The 8 numbers provided in the list are shown as green (solution) or red (non-solution) circles. A successful input will include 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions, so the image returned will show 4 green dots and 4 red dots.

@span{.center}{@image{images/inequality-works.png,"" ,""}}

If their list of 8 values doesn't include an equal number of solutions and non-solutions there will be an unequal distribution of red and green dots and they will get an error message encouraging them to adjust their list.

@span{.center}{@image{images/not-quite.png,"" ,""}}

Encourage students to use negatives, positives, fractions and decimals as they generate their lists.
