| Key Points for the Facilitator
|* A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images.  But unlike those types, there are only _two_ values: `true` and `false`. While simple to explain, this different behavior can be confusing for some students.
* Boolean-producing functions are essentially yes-or-no questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
* For example, `odd?` and `even?` (pronounced "odd-huh?" and "even-huh?" in Scheme) are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `odd?` and `even?`.
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
* For example, `is-odd`, `is-even` are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `is-odd` and `is-even`.

== Introducing Booleans @duration{20 minutes}

=== Launch
Students should be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }

Ask students to evaluate Circles of Evaluation for simple expressions they've seen before, and ask them to convert them into code.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(+ 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(- 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(* 8 0))}

Then show them unfamiliar Circles of Evaluation, and ask them to hypothesize what they think they mean, what they will evaluate to, and what the code would look like.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(> 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(< 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(= 8 0))}

Have students convert these Circles to code and type them in. What did they evaluate to? What do they think the outputs mean?

Values like `true` and `false` obviously aren't Numbers or Images. But they also aren't Strings, or else they would have quotes around them. We've found a __new data type__, called a @vocab{Boolean}.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
- Explore the five functions in this starter file:  `odd?`, `even?`, `less-than-one?`, `continent?`,  `primary-color?`
- All five functions produce @vocab{Booleans}. Through your exploration, see if you can come up with an explanation of what a @vocab{Boolean} is.

[.lesson-point]
A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images. But unlike the others there are only two values: `true` and `false`.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{boolean-functions.adoc} and use the starter file to complete the questions, identifying inputs that will make each function produce `true`, and inputs that will make each function `false`.

@ifproglang{pyret}{Here is some additional practice with @link{../../../data-science/lessons/ds-pyret-intro/pages/booleans.html, Booleans}}

=== Synthesize
- Students will see functions on this page that they've never encountered before! But instead of answering their questions, encourage them to make a _guess_ about what they do, and then type it in to discover for themselves.
- Explicitly point out that _everything they know still works!_ They can use their reasoning about Circles of Evaluation and Contracts to figure things out.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Many students - especially traditionally high-achieving ones - will be very concerned about writing examples that are "wrong." The misconception here is that an expression that produces `false` is somehow _incorrect_. You can preempt this in advance, by explaining that our Boolean-producing functions _should sometimes return false_.

== Introducing Inequalities @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover (or expand their understanding of) inequalities by identifying solutions and non-solutions and connecting expressions to graphic representations.

Unlike equations, which have finite solution sets, inequalities can have infinite solutions.  Inequality expressions divide all of the numbers in the universe into two categories: solutions and non-solutions.  It is important that students are able to recognize that there are many possible solutions and non-solutions to an inequality and that they can identify whether or not a given number is or isn't part of the solution set.

This starter file includes a special `inequality` function that takes in a function, __which tests numbers in an inequality__, a list of 8 numbers __(to test in the function)__, and plots the numbers and a graph of the inequality on a number line.

When students successfully include 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions, the image returned will show 4 green dots and 4 red dots.

@span{.center}{@image{images/inequality-works.png,"" ,""}}

If their list of 8 values doesn't include an equal number of solutions and non-solutions there will be an unequal distribution of red and green dots and they will get an error message encouraging them to adjust their list.

@span{.center}{@image{images/not-quite.png,"" ,""}}

Encourage students to use negatives, positives, fractions and decimals as they generate their lists.

In order to stop seeing the examples written into the starter file code, students can comment out the example code by adding a # in front of each of the lines they want to hide.
