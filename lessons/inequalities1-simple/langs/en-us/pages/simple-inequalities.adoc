Each inequality expression in the first column contains a number.

Decide whether or not that number is a solution to the expression and place it in the appropriate column.

Then identify 4 _solution_ and 4 _non-solution_ values for `x`.

* *Solutions* will make the expression `true`.

* *Non-Solutions* will make the expression `false`.

Challenge yourself to use negatives, positives, fractions, decimals, etc. for your `x` values.
