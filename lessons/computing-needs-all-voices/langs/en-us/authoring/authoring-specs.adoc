= authoring requirements

When a new Pioneer is added, please also add their birthday to our Social Media Calendar so that we have an annual date for sharing their poster.

Make sure to include both last names for Hispanic pioneers. We got feedback about that on twitter.

Pioneer Thumbs are 250x250

Names need to be changed:

- in the title of the adoc
- inside the adoc (both in the title and the image name)
- in the `pioneer-thumbs` file
- in the `pioneer-imgs` file
- in `pages/comutingpioneers.adoc`

Images were processed using: 

- vanceai.com ("photo enhancer tools")
- use "toongineer cartoonizer", cartoon mode
- backgrounds removed using picwish.com
