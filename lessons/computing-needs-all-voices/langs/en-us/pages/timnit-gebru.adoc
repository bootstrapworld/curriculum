Co-founder: Black in AI, Advocate for Diversity in Tech

[.text]
Gebru was born and raised in Adis Ababa, Ethiopia. She fled at 15, during the Eritrean–Ethiopian War. After a brief stint in Ireland, she eventually received political asylum in the US, where she attended high school in Somerville, MA before earning her BS, MS, and PhD from Stanford. Gebru focuses on data mining, artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic bias. Her doctoral research won the 2017 LDV Capital Vision Summit competition, starting a series of collaborations with other entrepreneurs and investors. After leaving Apple, Microsoft and Google, she launched the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR) to document the effect of artificial intelligence on marginalized groups, with a focus on Africa and African immigrants in the United States. She also co-authored the paper "Datasheets for Datasets", with the goal of avoiding discriminatory outcomes that arise from reproducing or amplifying societal bias found in training datasets by encouraging researchers and practitioners in machine learning to document and understand their datasets better.
