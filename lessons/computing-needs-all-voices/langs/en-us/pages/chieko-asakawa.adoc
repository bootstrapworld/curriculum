Computer Scientist, Adaptive Technology

[.text]
Asakawa invents technology to help the visually impaired be more independent. Although she was born with normal sight, she began losing her sight at age 11 when she hit her left eye on the side of a swimming pool. She was fully blind by age 14. In 1997, she developed the Home Page Reader (HPR), a voice browser that allows blind and visually impaired users to surf the Internet and navigate Web pages through a computer's numeric keypad. She has also developed a  digital system to input and edit Braille; a network allowing Braille libraries to upload documents and books; and aDesigner, a disability simulator enabling sighted Web developers to mimic the experience of blind users.
