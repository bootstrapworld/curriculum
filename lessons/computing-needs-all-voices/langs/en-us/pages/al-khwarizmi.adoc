Al-Khwarizmi

[.title]
Mathematician

[.text]
In about 820, Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, a Muslim mathematician living in Baghdad, wrote a book presenting the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations. In the twelfth century (several hundred years later!) The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing was translated into Latin; the Latinized title of his book (Al-Jabr) is the source of the word "algebra." A second book by Al-Khwarizmi (which has only been preserved in its Latin translation) introduced the numerals we use today (0-9) and decimal positional number system to the Western world. The term "algorithm" is derived from the latinized version of his name.
