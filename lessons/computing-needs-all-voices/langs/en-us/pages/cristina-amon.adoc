Cristina Amon

[.title]
Engineer, Wearable Computers, Electric Vehicles

[.text]
Cristina Amon is a pioneer in the development of computational fluid dynamics, which uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows, like electronics cooling, wearable computers and electric vehicles. Her interest in science and engineering was inspired by one of her own female teachers when she was a young girl in Uruguay. "This special mentoring relationship helped me recognize the positive influence that strong role models can have on young women." Amon is committed to giving back to her profession and inspiring a younger generation of women to become engineers.
