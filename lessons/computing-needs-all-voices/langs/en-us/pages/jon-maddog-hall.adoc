He is the co-founder of Caninos Loucos (bringing inexpensive, locally designed and manufactured single board computers to Brazil) and President of Project Cauā (whose goals are to help university students better afford an education while improving the support of small businesses in using their computers).

His efforts on all fronts are making the tech community stronger, smarter, and more connected.
