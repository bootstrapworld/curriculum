Ada Lovelace

[.title]
Mathematician, Writer, Programmer

[.text]
Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as one of the world's first computer programmers. In 1842, she was asked to translate a lecture given by the developer of the Analytical Engine, the world's first mechanical general-purpose computer which was programmable by using punch cards. Lovelace added her own notes, and the document she produced ended up three times as long as the original transcript. In those notes, Lovelace suggested the Engine "might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent." She is thus one the first people to see value in computers outside of calculation.
