Shaffi Goldwasser

[.title]
Computer Scientist, Cryptography Expert

[.text]
Goldwasser is the inventor of several revolutionary cryptographic technologies. Much of her work focuses on what "secure" really means via rigorous mathematical study. One of her greatest achievements is the zero knowledge proof, which uses cryptography to prove that something is true without revealing any further information. Zero knowledge proofs are used today in sophisticated e-voting systems to prove proper tallying of votes without revealing who voted for what. Goldwasser won the prestigious Turing Award in 2012 for her research on cryptography. In 2018, Goldwasser became the Director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. She is also a professor of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley and MIT, professor of Computer Sciences & Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and the co-founder and chief scientist of Duality Technologies, which allows organizations to safely share and analyze encrypted data.
