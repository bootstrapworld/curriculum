Ajay Bhatt

[.title]
Computer Architect

[.text]
Indian-born American computer architect Ajay Bhatt is best known for his invention of USB (Universal Serial Bus) technology, which allows us to connect all sorts of devices to one another, including computers, phones, monitors, printers and more. Bhatt developed the USB after his wife was frustrated that she couldn't print their daughter's school project; the printer and computer she was using each required a different sort of cable and could not be linked. When Bhatt first pitched the idea to tech companies in the the early 90s, response was lukewarm. Bhatt persevered and the USB is now so essential that you can even buy one at a gas station! Bhatt, who holds over 130 US and International patents, was featured in the July 2010 issue of GQ India as one of “The 50 Most Influential Global Indians.”  Bhatt's advice for young people, “If you have imagination, then it is possible to make your vision a reality. Don’t follow the conventional path, think differently, and make the impossible possible.”
