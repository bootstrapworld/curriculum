Ajay Bhatt

[.title]
Computer Architect

[.text]
Ajay Bhatt is best known for his invention of USB (Universal Serial Bus) technology. USB cables - deemed so
essential today that they are sold at gas stations and drugstores – allow us to connect all sorts of devices to one another, including computers, phones, monitors, printers and more. Bhatt developed the USB after his wife was frustrated that she couldn't print their daughter's school project; the printer and computer she was using each
required a different sort of cable and could not be linked. As a result of this contribution (and others), Bhatt was featured in the July 2010 issue of GQ India as one of “The 50 Most Influential Global Indians.”
