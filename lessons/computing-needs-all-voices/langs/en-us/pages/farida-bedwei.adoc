[.name]
Farida Bedwei

[.title]
Software Developer, CTO, Author, Microfinance

[.text]
Bedwei developed a cloud software platform that allows micro-finance companies to administer small loans to borrowers in rural or undeveloped areas by sending unique codes to their customers' mobile phones, which customers can immediately exchange for money at local branches. Bedwei is proud of her platform, because it results in more loans to people in need. Born in Ghana in 1979, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of one. Throughout her life, and thanks to the tireless support of her mother, Bedwei has refused to let her disability affect her career. In honor of World Cerebral Palsy day, Bedwei created a superheroine named Karmzah for the Afrocomic app. In the comic series, Karmzah gains superpowers with her walking crutches and partners with Africa's greatest superheroes to defend her local community and African society at large.
