Robert Moses

[.title]
Educator and Civil Rights Leader

[.subtitle]
Algebra Project Founder

[.text]
Born in 1935, Moses was raised in the Harlem River public housing complex and graduated from Stuyvesant High School. He played basketball, studied French, earned a master's degree in philosophy from Harvard, and returned to NYC to teach math. Seeing scenes in the news of Black people picketing and sitting at lunch counters across the South moved him to head to Mississippi, where he was a voting rights organizer and an important leader in the Civil Rights Movement. When drafted for the Vietnam War, he moved to Tanzania and taught there for 8 years before returning to Cambridge to pursue his PhD. He left to found the Algebra Project when his eldest child entered the eighth grade in 1982 and was frustrated that her school did not offer algebra. The Algebra Project has since expanded across the country, tapping youth mentors and connecting math to the lived experiences of students.

“The most urgent social issue facing poor people and people of color today is economic access. In today's world, economic access and full citizenshp depend crucially on math and science literacy. The absence of mathematics literacy in urban and rural communities throughout this country is an issue as urgent as the lack of registered Black voters in Mississippi was in 1961.”
