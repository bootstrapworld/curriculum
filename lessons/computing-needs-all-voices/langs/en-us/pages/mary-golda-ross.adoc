Mary Golda Ross

[.title]
Aerospace Design, Satellites

[.text]
Ross is best known for her work on aerospace design and design concepts for interplanetary space travel, crewed and un-crewed Earth-orbiting flights, and the earliest studies of orbiting satellites for both defense and civilian purposes. Born in 1908, Ross was brought up "in the Cherokee tradition of equal education for boys and girls." After earning her bachelor’s degree in mathematics, she taught science and math in rural Oklahoma for 9 years, taking graduate courses during the summer. When the U.S. joined WWII, she moved to California and was hired by Lockheed to work on the first jet that could travel at over 400mph. After the war, she was on the top-secret space race think tank "The Skunk Works" - the only woman and the only American Indian on the 40 person team. The 2019 Native American $1 coin honored American Indians in the Space Program and featured
an image of Ross.
