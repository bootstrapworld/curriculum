Alan Turing

[.title]
Cryptography, Theoretical Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence

[.text]
Alan Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, defining the limits of computability. He was also responsible for early work in artificial intelligence. In addition, during World War II, Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages sent by the Nazis. Despite this, in 1952, Turing was criminalized for his homosexuality. Fifty-five years after his death, he was pardoned by the British government, thanks largely to a campaign led by activists on his behalf. Turing has since become the first gay man on a British bank note. The Turing Award, named in his honor, is the highest award in computing and is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing.”
