== Displaying Categorical Variables @duration{10 minutes}
=== Overview
@ifproglang{pyret}{Students extend their understanding of Contracts and function application, learning new functions that consume Tables and produce displays and plots.}

@ifproglang{codap}{Students use various Transformers on the Animals dataset to produce displays and plots.}

=== Launch
Have students ever seen any _pictures_ created from tables of data? Can they think of a situation when they'd want to consume a _Table_, and use that to produce an image?

@ifproglang{pyret}{
The library included at the top of the file includes some helper functions that are useful for Data Science, which we will use throughout this course. Here is the @vocab{Contract} for a function that makes @vocab{pie charts}:

@show{(contract "pie-chart" '("Table" "String") "Image" )}

And here is an example of _using_ the function:

`pie-chart(animals-table, "legs")`

[.lesson-instruction]
- What is the Name of this function?
- How many inputs are in its @vocab{Domain}?
- In the Interactions Area, type `pie-chart(animals-table, "legs")` and hit Enter. What happens?

@span{.right}{@image{images/legsp.png,"" ,300}}

Hovering over a pie slice reveals the label, as well as the count and the percentage of the whole. In this example we see that there is 1 animal with 0 legs, representing 3.1% of the population.

We can also resize the window by dragging its borders. This allows us to experiment with the data before closing the window and generating the final, non-interactive image.

The function `pie-chart` consumes a Table of data, along with the _name of a *categorical* column you want to display_. The computer goes through the column, counting the number of times that each value appears. Then it draws a pie slice for each value, with the size of the slice being the percentage of times it appears.  In this example, we used our `animals-table` table as our dataset, and made a pie chart showing the distribution of the number of `legs` across the shelter.
}



@ifproglang{codap}{
Open the Animals Dataset in CODAP.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Click the `graph` icon from the menu in the upper left. What appears?
- Select a dot with your mouse. What happens?
- How do you think the position of each dots is determined?

@span{.right}{@image{images/codap-initial-display.png,"" ,300}}

Initially, the data points are randomly distributed on the graph. Hovering over an orange dot reveals the `name` of that particular animal. Notice that when you hover over a particular dot, the table row for that animal is also highlighted in blue. When you hold the shift button, you can select multiple dots in the graphical display, or multiple rows in the table.

Experiment with highlighting multiple table rows. Explore what happens when you set aside selected and / or unselected cases (available by selecting the eye icon to the right of the table and to the right of the graph).

We can also resize the window by dragging its borders. This allows us to experiment with the data before closing the window and generating the final, non-interactive image.
}


=== Investigate
@ifproglang{pyret}{
Here is the @vocab{Contract} for another function, which makes @vocab{bar charts}:

@show{(contract "bar-chart" '("Table" "String") "Image" )}


[.lesson-instruction]
- Which column of the animals table tells us which species the animal is?
- Use `bar-chart` to make a display showing how many animals there are of each species.
- Experiment with pie and bar charts, passing in different column names. If you get an error message, _read it carefully!_
- What do you think are the rules for what kinds of columns can be used by _bar-chart_ and _pie-chart_?
- When would you want to use one chart instead of another?
}

To dig deeper into pie charts and bar charts, have students turn to @opt-printable-exercise{pie-chart-notice.adoc}, @opt-printable-exercise{bar-chart-notice.adoc}, @opt-printable-exercise{bar-and-pie-notice.adoc}, @opt-printable-exercise{matching-bar-to-pie.adoc}.

@span{.title}{Note for Teachers on Sex & Gender}
When students make a display of the `sex` of the animals, they will see that some animals are male, some are female and some are hermaphrodites. We use the descriptor _sex_ rather than _gender_ because sex refers to biology, whereas gender refers to identity. Hermaphrodite is the biological term for animals that carry eggs & produce sperm (nearly 1/3 of the non-insect animal species on the planet!). Plants that produce pollen & ovules are also hermaphrodites. While the term used to be used by the medical community to describe intersex people or people who identify as transgender or gender non-binary, it was not biologically accurate, as humans are not able to produce both viable eggs and sperm, and it is no longer considered an acceptable term to apply to people.

@ifproglang{codap}{
Once we have a graph of randomly distributed data points, we can drag attributes from the table to the axes to organize the data.

Experiment with creating some bar charts in CODAP.
[.lesson-instruction]
- Drag the `fixed` attribute from the table to the y-axis. Now try dragging it to the x-axis. What do you notice?
- Select the `configuration` icon to the right of the data display. Select `fuse dots into bars`
- Now, make a bar chart showing how many animals there are of each species.
- Experiment with bar charts, dragging new attributes to the axes - or clicking on the axis title to display a menu of attributes.
- Which types of attributes can be displayed with the dots fused into bars? For which types of attributes does CODAP instead offer to create a bar for each point?
}

=== Common Misconceptions
@ifproglang{pyret}{
Pie charts and bar charts can show _counts_ or _percentages_ of categorical data. If there are more people with brown hair than blond hair, for example, a pie chart of hair color will have a larger slice or longer bar for "brown" than for "blond". In Pyret, pie charts show percentages, and bar charts show counts.

A pie chart can only display one categorical variable, but a bar chart might be used to display two or more. Pie charts have a wedge for each represented category. Unlike in bar charts, empty categories will not be included in a pie chart. When comparing bar charts, it is important to read the scales on the y-axes. If the scales do not match, a taller bar may not represent a larger value.
}

@ifproglang{codap}{
Bar charts may show counts or percentages. (Try clicking the `ruler` icon to toggle between the two, or to show both simultaneously.) A bar chart might be used to display two or more categorical variables. (Pie charts, which CODAP does not create, display only one categorical variable.)
}

Note: Bar charts look a lot another kind of chart - called a "histogram" - which are actually quite different because they display _quantitative_ data, not categorical. This lesson focuses entirely on pie- and bar-charts.

=== Synthesize
@ifproglang{pyret}{
Pie and Bar Charts display what portion of a sample belongs to each category. If they are based on sample data from a larger population, we use them to _infer_ the proportion of a whole population that might belong to each category.

[.lesson-point]
Pie charts and bar charts are mostly used to _display categorical columns_.

While bars in some bar charts should follow some logical order (alphabetical, small-medium-large, etc), the pie slices and bars can technically be placed in _any_ order, without changing the meaning of the chart.

@span{.title}{Mini Project: Making Infographics}
Infographics are a powerful tool for communicating information, especially when made by people who actually understnad how to connect visuals to data in meaningful ways. @opt-printable-exercise{infographics.adoc} is an opportunity for students to become more flexible math thinkers while tapping into their creativity. This project can be made on the computer or with pencil and paper.

== Exploring other Displays @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
@ifproglang{pyret}{
Students freely explore the Data Science display library. In doing so, they experiment with new charts, practice reading @vocab{Contracts} and error messages, and develop better intuition for the programming constructs they've seen before.}

Today you’ve added more functions to your toolbox. Functions like `pie-chart` and `bar-chart` can be used to visually display data, and even transform entire tables!

You will have many opportunities to use these concepts in this course, by writing programs to answer data science questions.}

@span{.title}{Extension Activity}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
Sometimes we want to summarize a categorical column in a Table, rather than a pie chart. For example, it might be handy to have a table that has a row for dogs, cats, lizards, and rabbits, and then the count of how many of each type there are. Pyret has a function that does exactly this! Try typing this code into the Interactions Area: `count(animals-table, "species")`

What did we get back? `count` is a function that consumes a table and the name of a categorical column, and produces a _new table_ with exactly the columns we want: the name of the category and the number of times that category occurs in the dataset. What are the names of the columns in this new table?

- Use the `count` function to make a table showing the number of animals that are `fixed` (or not) from the shelter.

- Use the `count` function to make a table showing the number of animals of each `sex` from the shelter.

Sometimes the dataset we have is _already_ summarized in a table like this, and we want to make a chart from _that_. In this situation, we want to base our display on the summary table: the size of the pie slice or bar is taken directly from the count column, and the label is taken directly from the value column. When we want to use summarized data to produce a pie chart, we have the contract for another function:

@show{(contract "pie-chart-summarized" '("Table" "String" "String") "Image" )}

And an example of using that function (applying `count` to the `animals-table` to force it into the shape `pie-chart-summarized` needs):

`pie-chart-summarized(count(animals-table,"species"), "value", "count")`
}

For example, it might be handy to have a table that has a row for dogs, cats, lizards, and rabbits, and then the count of how many of each type there are. CODAP has a Transformers plug-in that does exactly this! From the menu in the upper left, select `plugins`, then `Transformers`. Choose the `Count` transformer. Select the Animals dataset, and the `species` attribute.
