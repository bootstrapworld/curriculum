|*1*
| For every additional Marvel Universe movie released each year, the average person is predicted to consume @fitbruby{10ex}{3.19}{[amount]} @fitbruby{10ex}{_fewer_}{[more / fewer]} pounds of sugar! This correlation is @fitbruby{30ex}{_non-existent_}{[strong, moderate, weak, non-existent]}.

| Shoe size and height are @fitbruby{30ex}{_strongly_}{[strongly, moderately, weakly, not]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{_positively_}{[positively / negatively]} correlated. If person A is one size bigger than person B, we predict that they will be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{_1.65_}{[amount]} inches taller than person B as well.

| There is @fitbruby{30ex}{_no_}{[a strong, a moderate, no]} relationship found between the number of Uber drivers in a city and the number of babies born each year.

| The correlation between weeks-of-school-missed and SAT score is @fitbruby{30ex}{_moderate_}{[strong, moderate, weak, non-existent]} and @fitbruby{20ex}{_negative_}{[positive / negative]}. For every week a student misses, we predict a @fitbruby{10ex}{_15.3_}{[amount]} point @fitbruby{10ex}{drop}{[gain / drop]} in their SAT score.

| There is a @fitbruby{30ex}{_weak_}{[strong, moderate, weak, non-existent]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{_positive_}{[positive / negative]} correlation between the number of streaming video services someone has, and how much they weigh. For each service, we expect them to be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{_1.6_}{[amount]} pounds heavier.
