@n Why can't we justify the following statement with the data?

_Very few of the people sacrificed were female._

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{because it's possible that all of skulls marked `unsure` are `female`, in which case 45% of the skulls would be female!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n How can we justify the following statement with the data?

_Adult skulls were at least twice as common as skulls from children._

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If we add the wedges for `child` and `unsure` together we get 30%. `Adults` account for 70%, which is a little more than twice that.}}
