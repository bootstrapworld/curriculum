@description{In today’s lesson, students will take the dataset on skull size, sex, and age group from yesterday’s lesson and think about how to display this information so that we can more easily draw conclusions about the practice of human sacrifice in the ancient Maya civilization.

== Review: Who did the Ancient Maya Sacrifice? @duration{5-10 minutes}

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete the @printable-exercise{do-now.adoc}

Yesterday, we began to investigate _who_ the ancient Maya were sacrificing to see if it could give us any clues as to what happened to their empire!

Today, we’re going to go a step further into our role as archeologists by actually analyzing the data we collected about skull sizes in Google Sheets to see if it might tell us anything meaningful. We’re going to be using the computer and spreadsheets to generate a simpler representation of the data we saw yesterday. As we go through the lesson today, we should not only have the big unit questions in mind, but also, we should be thinking about what benefits there may be to displaying data in the way we are going to today.

== Calculating Count and Proportion @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students will learn to generate a count from a dataset and use it to find fractional and decimal proportions. Students will be exposed to the concept of formulas in Google Sheets and how they take information from other cells to generate data for the cell they define, but will not be asked to define functions themselves.

=== Launch

We are going to work with three datasets to learn how to do the @vocab{count} and calculate the @vocab{proportion}, in both fraction form and in decimal form. I’ll do the first one to show you how, we will do the second together, and you will try the third on your own.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Turn to @printable-exercise{count-prop.adoc}. The first table contains data on head size and hat styles. In the table on the right, we need to fill in the column on @vocab{count}.

* The glossary at the top of the page defines @vocab{count} as _the number of items in a certain category_.
** I see four baseball caps listed in the table, so the @vocab{count} of baseball caps will be 4.
* Let's finish filling in the count column with the number of hats of each style.
** What's the count for cowboy hats? _3_
** What's the count for fedoras? _1_
** What's the count for sombreros? _2_
* To find the total, we'll add all of the counts together... in this case, the total is 10.
Now that we have the counts, we can find the @vocab{proportion}. According to the glossary... _a proportion is a fraction, decimal, or percent that equals `count` divided by ``total``_
* For baseball caps, I see that the count is 4 and the total is 10, so the proportion will be @math{\frac{4}{10}}.
* Let's finish filling in the "proportion as fraction" column.
** What's the proportion for cowboy hats? _@math{\frac{3}{10}}_
** What's the proportion for fedoras? _@math{\frac{1}{10}}_
** What's the proportion for sombreros? _@math{\frac{2}{10}}_

Finally, we need to find the "proportion as a decimal".

* You might know already that you can divide the top number of any fraction by the bottom number to turn it into a decimal.
* You might also already know that @math{\frac{4}{10}} can be written as @math{0.4}... but...

*Today we're going to let Google Sheets do the math for us!*

Open a copy of the @starter-file{pie-chart}, click on the `Teaching Example - Hat Styles` tab, and project it for the class.

This Google Sheet has been preprogrammed to calculate `Proportion (Decimal)` for us. Let's take a look at how it works.

* When I click on cell `H2`, a formula appears by `fx` in the top left.
* It says `F2/F6`.
** What information is in cell `F2`? _the count of baseball caps_
** What information is in cell `F6`? _the total count of hats_
** The cell has been programmed to divide the count in `F2` by the total in `F6`!
* I'm going to enter the data we've already collected into our table and see what Google Sheets gives us back for `Proportion (Decimal)`
** Did we get what we expected?
** Any questions on what just happened?
* Please write these numbers down in your table.

Now that we've completed the `hat styles` portion together, you can click on the `Skulls: male or female` tab and begin working through the next table with your partner.

Once you complete the second table, try doing the third table with the `Skulls by Age` tab on your own.

=== Synthesize

_Pair-Share: Students turn and talk, then share out._

Why is finding the proportion (instead of just the count) from a big data set helpful in interpreting data?

_The proportion puts the data in context. A count of 5 means something very different if there are 10 data points than if there are 1000 data points._

== Creating Pie Charts in Google Sheets

=== Overview

Students will be introduced to visual representations of data, learning to reflect on and produce pie charts in Google Sheets.

=== Launch

We are now going to learn a tool that data scientists use all the time to show patterns in their data: visual representations. Today you will learn how to make a @vocab{pie chart}!

[.lesson-instruction]
Take a couple of minutes to notice and wonder about @printable-exercise{pie-chart.adoc}.

* What did you notice?
* What did you wonder?

=== Investigate

Begin by demonstrating how to make a pie chart in Google Sheets. Open your copy of the @starter-file{pie-chart}, click on the `Teaching Example - Hat Styles` tab, and project it for the class.

[.lesson-instruction]

To generate the pie chart we just saw, we would:

* Select the `hat style` column of data
* Go to the menu and click on “Insert” > “Chart”

@centered-image{images/insert-chart.png, screenshot from Google Sheets}

* Google Sheets knows how to make many kinds of charts! If you don't get a pie chart right away, there's a chart-editor menu on the right-hand side.

@centered-image{images/chart-editor.png, screenshot from Google Sheets}

* Click on the down arrow to reveal the full list of chart types and scroll down to select `Pie`

You're about to make your own pie charts. Does anyone have any questions before we begin?

Ok. Turn to @printable-exercise{pie-chart-practice.adoc}

=== Synthesize

* The datasets we've been looking at focus on 20 skulls. At its peak the ancient Maya numbered about 20 million people. Over time, they sacrificed thousands of people to their gods. If archaeologists had only ever found 20 skulls, do you think it would be scientifically sound to draw conclusions about Maya practices from this dataset? _This is a pretty small sample. Generally, bigger samplesizes more accurately represent the whole story. When reading the results of a study, it is always good to double check how big the sample size was!_
* Because we are learning, we will be working with small datasets throughout this unit. The people who made these datasets know about the data in bigger datasets and have made these little datasets to be fairly representative of the data that archaeologists have collected about Maya human sacrifice.  Given that information, who do you think was being sacrificed most often in the ancient Maya civilization?
* Based on the data, do you have any new ideas about why the ancient Maya civilization ended? Explain your answer.
* In today's @opt-printable-exercise{journal.adoc}, students are asked:
** What did we learn about the ancient Maya today?
** Has your thinking changed at all about why the ancient Maya declined?
** What evidence did we examine?
** What data science skills did we learn?
