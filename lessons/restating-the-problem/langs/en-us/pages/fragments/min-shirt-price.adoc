"The Swamp in the City Festival is ordering t-shirts. The production cost is $75 to set up the silk screen and $9 per shirt. Use the Design Recipe to write a function  @funname  that takes in the number of shirts to be ordered, _n_, and returns the minimum amount the festival should charge for the shirts in order to break even. (Assume that they will sell all of the shirts.)"
