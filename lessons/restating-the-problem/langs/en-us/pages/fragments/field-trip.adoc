"Manhattan Country School is planning to take their 7th & 8th graders to an exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York and stop for tamales on the way back to school.  The museum charges a flat fee of $175 for a school group and tamales are $2 each. Write a function @funname that takes in the number of students, _n_, and calculates the total cost of the field trip."
