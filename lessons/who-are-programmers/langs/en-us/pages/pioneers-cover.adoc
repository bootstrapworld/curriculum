We are excited to share a downloadable poster set, featuring the contributions of inspiring pioneers, in language accessible to young people. We intend to continue expanding this poster library and encourage you to either check back at @link{https://www.BootstrapWorld.org} for updates or follow us on social media `@bootstrapworld` for announcements about new releases.

Our initial goal was to produce a black and white poster set, to make it as easy as possible for teachers to print these posters, but we have yet to find a black and white filter that does justice to images of people of color, so we've settled on color posters for now. If you have a photo processing program to suggest, please let us know at @link{mailto:contact@bootstrapworld.org}! Suggestions of other pioneers you'd like to see included are also welcome and might bump them up on our to do list.
