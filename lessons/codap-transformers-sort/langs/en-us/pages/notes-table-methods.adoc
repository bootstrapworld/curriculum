= Defining Row Functions &amp; Using Table Methods

*Methods* are special functions that are attached to pieces of data. We use them to manipulate Tables. 

- In this course, the methods we’ll be using are  

** `row-n` - consumes an index (starting with zero!) and produces a row from a table
** `order-by` - consumes the name of a column and a Boolean value to determine if that table should be sorted by that column in ascending order
** `filter` - consumes a __Boolean-producing function__, and produces a table containing only rows for which the function returns `true`
** `build-column` - consumes the name of a new column, and a function that produces the values in that column for each Row

- Unlike functions, methods can’t be used alone. They have a “secret” argument, which is the data they are attached to. They are written as part of that data, separated by a dot. For example:
+
`shapes.row-n(2)`

- Contracts for methods are different from other functions. They include the type of the data as part of their names. For example:
+ 
`<table>.row-n {two-colons} (index {two-colons} Number) -> Row`
}

= Three Transformers: Sort, Filter, and Build Attribute

*Transformers* allow you to transform datasets to produce new, distinct output datasets, instead of modifying the original input dataset itself. We use them to manipulate tables.

- Contracts for Transformers have three imporant parts: the Transformer’s name; the domain of the Transformer (the type(s) of data we give it); and the range of the Transformer (the type of data the transformer produces).

- In this course, the three primary Transformers we'll be using are:

** `Sort` - *consumes* a dataset, a column/attribute name, and a sort direction (ascending or descending); `Sort` *produces* a copy of the input dataset, with cases sorted by the selected column/attribute.
** `Filter` - *consumes* a dataset to filter and a formula expression that evaluates to either true or false. `Filter` *produces* a copy of the input dataset that only has the cases for which the formula was true.
** `Build Attribute` - *consumes* a dataset, a name for the new column/attribute, a collection to add the attribute to, a formula expression for the attribute's values, and the data type formula will expression will evaluate to. `Built attribute` *produces*
a copy of the input dataset, with the new attribute added.

- Each of the above Transformers is attached to a formula expression. It's important to get the formula expressoin just right, or the Transformer will produce an error. The formula expression might just be a column/attribute (this is always the case for `Sort`!) or it might require a Boolean (this is often true for `Build Attribute` and `Filter`).
