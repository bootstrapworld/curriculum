@design-recipe-exercise{"symmetry"
"Nassim loves all things symmetrical. He figured out that if you flip an image horizontally and then place it beside the original image, you can turn any image into a symmetrical image. Help him to be more efficient by writing a new function @funname that will take in any image and use it to make a new symmetrical image."
