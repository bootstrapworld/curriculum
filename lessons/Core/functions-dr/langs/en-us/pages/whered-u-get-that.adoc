= Where Did You Get That?

Another activity that reinforces the connections between representations using the Design Recipe is called "Where'd You Get That?", which can also be used by teachers to help students discover problems in their Design Recipe work without pointing out their mistakes.

@vspace{1ex}

@n The activity requires two people: the Challenger, and the Defender.

[.indentedpara]
_Most of the time, the teacher is in the role of Challenger._

@n The Challenger starts at the *bottom* of the page, physically pointing to one part of the function definition and asking "Where'd you get that?"

[.indentedpara]
--
__The Defender has to _physically point_ to some location in the Examples, and explain exactly how they got that part of the definition.__

@vspace{1ex} Once the Defender has shown that they can trace their thinking from Definition to Examples, the game moves to the next stage.
--

@n The Challenger starts asking about the _Examples_, and now the Defender needs to refer back to the _Contract and Purpose_.

@n This is repeated for every other step in the recipe, as students work their way back to the original word problem.

For example:

- *Challenger* (pointing at variable in the Definition): Where'd you get that?
- *Defender* (pointing at label in the Examples): Well, I circled the parts of the Examples that change, and gave them that label.
- *Challenger* (pointing at the label): OK, but where did you get the label?
- *Defender* (pointing at Purpose Statement): I used that term in the Purpose Statement.
- *Challenger* (pointing at Purpose Statement): Where'd you get that term?
- *Defender* (pointing to Word Problem): I found it here in the Word Problem.
