= Rubric: Design Recipe

_This rubric can be used for teachers to score students' Design Recipes or for peer review._ If using this rubric for peer review, trade your Design Recipe with another student. Place this rubric and their Design Recipe side-by-side in front of you.

@n Go through the checklist in the left-hand column to assess their Contract. Check boxes or leave them blank depending on what you observe.

@n Once you have examined and analyzed the Contract, read the descriptive text (either “Wow!” or “Getting there”) and check whichever one more accurately describes the work in front of you.

@n If the Design Recipe you're reviewing is “getting there,” provide some descriptive feedback to help the student fix their work.

@n Repeat the process for the remaining sections of the Design Recipe.

| The *CONTRACT*:
| * [ ] Wow!
| * [ ] Getting There...
|
* [ ] has correct function name
* [ ] has correct amount of Domain data types
* [ ] has correct data type(s) listed in the Domain
* [ ] has correct data type listed for the Range

| The Contract you’ve written tells us a lot about how to use the function. In fact, we can figure out how to use your function just by looking at the Contract. You’ve included all essential information.
| Something is missing from your Contract. It doesn’t provide everything needed to understand the function.

*_Here’s what you need to do:_*

| The *PURPOSE STATEMENT*:
| * [ ] Wow!
| * [ ] Getting There...
|
* [ ] describes what the function consumes and produces
* [ ] describes how the result is computed, so that it can be combined to with the Contract to explain the Examples

| The Purpose Statement is a concise and detailed restatement of the problem in your own words. It’s a helpful explanation of what’s happening in the problem.
| Programmers and Mathematicians alike find it helpful to restate a problem in their own words.

*_Your restatement is missing the following:_*

| The *EXAMPLES*:
| * [ ] Wow!
| * [ ] Getting There...

|
* [ ] have the correct function name
* [ ] have inputs that differ across Examples
* [ ] have the correct amount of Domain inputs
* [ ] have the correct expressions for what the function produces, using the given inputs
* [ ] have changeable parts circled and labeled

| Your Examples not only help us to identify the pattern to define a function, they also let us double check that the functions we define do what we intend for them to do.
| Your Examples do not help us to identify a pattern, or they don’t allow us to double check our functions.

*_Here’s how you can improve that:_*

| The *DEFINITION*:
| * [ ] Wow!
| * [ ] Getting There...
|
* [ ] has the correct function name
* [ ] has the correct number, name, and order of variables (taken from the labels in the Examples section)

| Your code correctly names the function, lists its variables, and states the expression to compute when the function is used!
| Your Definition is missing something.
