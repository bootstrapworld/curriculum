| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
- Code should be easy to read! There may be other people looking at your code who could use a hint about what it does, and even the person who wrote the code could benefit from a note here and there. @vocab{Comments} are parts of a program that the computer ignores - they are for human eyes only!
- The @vocab{Purpose Statement} is a structured way of restating the problem. In a computer program, it's written as a comment in the code - something the computer doesn't read.
- Remind students that the @vocab{Domain} and @vocab{Range} of a function must be a _set_ of possible inputs and outputs. In math, some of these sets have shorthands like Integers, Rationals, etc. In programming, we have shorthands for @vocab{data types} like Number, String, Image, Boolean, etc.
- If students struggle with creating the examples, use "Where'd You Get That" to help students build up their understanding around the concept.

== The Design Recipe

=== Overview
In this lesson students build on what they already know about multiple representations of functions (contracts, examples and definitions) to write purpose statements and gain fluency with the Design Recipe.

=== Launch
@slidestyle{Launch}

A word problem is a description of a situation, but seeing the math behind the words can be challenging! We are going to learn a strategy for breaking down word problems, called the *Design Recipe*. 

Programmers and Mathematicians alike find it helpful to restate a problem in their own words. After all, if you can't explain a problem to someone else, you probably don't understand it yourself!

In the *Design Recipe* we call this *Writing a Purpose Statement*.

@slidebreak{Launch}

We write @vocab{Purpose Statements}, because Contracts don't provide enough details to generate examples and write a @vocab{function definition}. 

For example, the Contract for `circle` says it needs a Number and two Strings, but that's not the whole story! 

- We can't use negative numbers for the radius.
- We can only use `"solid"` or `"outline"` for the first String.
- The last String has to be a color!

_The @vocab{Purpose Statement} is all the stuff that's missing from the Contract._

@slidebreak{Launch}

@lesson-instruction{
- On @printable-exercise{matching-wp-purpose.adoc}, we see four word problems and four @vocab{purpose statements}.
- Take 2 minutes to read them and see if you can find any that describe the same thing and should be matched to each other.
- What pairs did you come up with?
- What do you Notice about those purpose statements? Do they have anything in common?
}

@lesson-point{
Purpose statements should have enough details to allow us to write examples without looking at the word problem!
}

=== Investigate
@slidestyle{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/create-examples-contracts-purpose-1.adoc}, read the purpose statements, and write examples that satisfy each of the contracts and purpose statements.
- @opt{For more practice, complete @opt-printable-exercise{pages/create-examples-contracts-purpose-2.adoc}.}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

A good @vocab{Purpose Statement} must have three things:

1. A description of what the function _consumes_

2. A description of what the function _produces_

3. All the _relevant information_ about how to produce that output

But what does _"relevant information"_ really mean?

@QandA{
@Q{What information do we need, in order to write our examples?}
@A{The name of the function}
@A{Examples of real data that we're using in the example}
@A{What we do with the information contained in that real data}
}

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

- Turn to @printable-exercise{fixing-purpose.adoc}.
- An AI chatbot (like ChatGPT) has produced a purpose statement for each word problem... but ran into some difficulties.
- Fix the chatbot's purpose statements, and then identify:
  * What important information was missing from each purpose statement that you would need to solve the problem? 
  * What extra information was included, that wasn't needed to solve the problem?
}

@strategy{The Design Recipe in your Classroom}{


The three steps of the Design Recipe are designed to mirror best practices that you may _already be using in your classroom_. It's merely a collection of those practices, assembled in a structured way with great care taken to connecting each practice with the others.

*Writing the Contract and Purpose Statement is where students _understand_ the word problem.* If you have your students restate the problem in their own words, draw pictures, or underline the inputs and outputs in the word problem, _you're already using this practice!_

*Writing examples and circling-and-labeling what changes is where students _apply_ their understanding* to concrete inputs. If you have your students work through some concrete examples before jumping straight to variables and formulas, and ask them "what's the rule?" or "what's the pattern?", _you're already using this practice!_.

*Writing the definition is where students _formalize and abstract_ this understanding* to work with _any input_. This is where they identify the structure of the rule or pattern, independently of any specific inputs.

The order of the recipe is a recommendation based on 20+ years of research about what works for most students, but that doesn't mean this order works best for _every_ student! Some may find it easier to work through a concrete example or two before thinking about Domain and Range, and there's nothing wrong with that. We encourage you to use the Recipe in your classroom as often as possible, teaching students to be flexible with the tools and representations it includes.

== Rocket Height

=== Overview
Students are given a non-working program, which uses a linear function to determine the height of a rocket after a given length of time. The "broken" code is provided to lower cognitive load, allowing students to focus on comprehension (reading the code) and making use of structure (identifying where it's broken).

=== Launch
@slidestyle{Launch-DN}

@QandA{
There's a lot of buzz out there around Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) tools, which claim to be able to solve math problems, write essays, and even write code for us! 

A few students found A.I. tools that claim to be able to write Pyret programs for them. They asked the A.I. to generate code that makes a rocket blast off, starting on the ground (height=0) when the rocket first blasts off (time=0). The A.I. wrote the program for them.

How do they know if it really solved the problem correctly?

Open the @starter-file{rocket-height}, and click "Run".

@Q{What happens when you press the space-bar?}
@A{The seconds change, but the rocket doesn't move!}
@Q{What were you expecting to happen?}
@A{The rocket would move!}
@Q{What happens when you press `b`?}
@A{The seconds go back down, but the rocket height stays at 0.}
@Q{Is `rocket-height` working?}
@A{No.}
}

@teacher{
Direct students to close the window with the rocket, so that they can see the code.
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

If there are examples for how the program _should_ work, we can automatically detect when AI writes bad code for us. But we didn't get any warning here! Why not?

@QandA{
Type @show{(code '(rocket-height 0))} into the Interactions Area.
@Q{As the program is currently written, what happens when we give the `rocket-height` function an input of 0?}
@A{It returns 0.}
@Q{Is that what we want it to do?}
@A{Yes!}
@Q{As the program is currently written, what happens when we give the `rocket-height` function an input of 10?}
@A{It returns 0.}
@Q{Is that what we want it to do?}
@A{No!}
@Q{Why did the examples pass?}
@A{The programmer only gave one example! We should always provide at least two examples. More complex functions will require us to think about what range of examples will be necessary to test that our function does what we want it to!}
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

@lesson-point{
We should always test a function definition against at least 2 examples!
}

=== Investigate
@slidestyle{Investigate}

Let's use the Design Recipe to fix `rocket-height`, and get comfortable with writing @vocab{purpose statements}.

@lesson-instruction{
Complete @printable-exercise{rocket-height.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
As students work, circle the room and make sure that their @vocab{purpose statements} are strong enough that they could write @vocab{examples} without looking at the original word problem. Encourage students to circle what's changing in their examples and label with descriptive @vocab{variables}.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Once you've completed the Design Recipe page for `rocket-height`, type the code into Definitions Area, replacing any missing and incorrect code with your own.
- When it's working correctly, explore the other functions in the file.
}

@teacher{
For students needing more specific instructions about exploring the file, try the following:

- Remove the comment from before the `(blastoff rocket-height)` and test the program.

- Put the comment back in front of `(blastoff rocket-height)`, remove the comment from `(graph rocket-height)`, and test the program.

- Try out `(space rocket-height)`

- Try out `(everything rocket-height)`
}

@strategy{Teacher Tool: "Where'd You Get That?"}{


This is a powerful tool that forces students to explain their thinking, making deeper connections between steps, and helps teachers guide students to find their own mistakes. It requires two people: the Challenger, and the Defender. Most of the time, the teacher is in the role of Challenger.

The Challenger starts at the *bottom* of the page, physically pointing to one part of the _Definition_ and asking "Where'd you get that?" The Defender has to _physically point_ somewhere in the Examples, and explain what they're pointing to supports their Definition.

Next, the Challenger starts asking about the _Examples_ and the Defender needs to show how their _Contract and Purpose_ support them. This is repeated for every other step in the recipe, as students work their way back to the original word problem:

- _Challenger_ (pointing at the `seconds` variable in the Definition): Where'd you get that?
- _Defender_ (pointing at label in the Examples): Well, I circled the parts of the Examples that change, and labeled them as "seconds".
- _Challenger_(pointing at the label): OK, but where did you get that label?
- _Defender_ (pointing at Purpose Statement): I used "seconds" in the Purpose Statement.
- _Challenger_ (pointing at Purpose Statement): Where'd you get that term?
- _Defender_ (pointing to Word Problem): I got it from reading the Word Problem.
}


@opt{_For teachers who cover quadratic and exponential functions, or have students who need more of a challenge_, checkout the @opt-printable-exercise{rocket-challenges.adoc}:

- *Changing slope:* Can you make the rocket fly faster? Slower?
- *Changing sign:* Can you make the rocket sink down instead of fly up?
- *Motivating Quadratic Functions:* Can you make the rocket _accelerate over time_, so that it moves faster the longer it flies?
- *Practicing the Quadratic Formula:* Can you make the rocket blast off _and then land again_?
- *More practice:* Can you make the rocket blast off, _reach a maximum height of exactly 1000 meters_, and then land?
- *More practice:* Can you make the rocket blast off, reach a maximum height of exactly 1000 meters, and then land after exactly 100 seconds?
- *Motivating Exponential Functions:* Can you make the rocket fly to the edge of the the universe?

Even great programmers make mistakes sometimes. And in a world where AI is being used more and more, it's critical that we be able to write examples so that we can detect when AI messes up!

- What problems did you fix in AI's code?
- What did the other functions do?
- Which step in the Design Recipe are you feeling the most confident about? The least? 

@teacher{At this stage, it is normal for students to feel most confident about the Contract and Examples, and the least confident about Purpose Statements and Definitions.}

@strategy{Design Recipe Telephone}{
Most computer programs are written by teams, and sometimes those teams represent hundreds of people spread across the world! It is critical that each team member records their thinking with enough detail for other team members to be able to pick up where they left off. In @opt-printable-exercise{dr-telephone.adoc}, students collaborate to complete a series of Design Recipe Problems, with each student being responsible for only one part of each problem in the set.

You can use any word problems you like, but we have provided two sets that lend themselves particularly well to the activity. One set can be used to collaboratively update the functions in @opt-starter-file{collaboration}, which generates a cool mystery image if all three problems are solved correctly!

Optionally: At the end of the activity, students swap papers with a partner to conduct a Design Recipe Peer review. Use @handout{rubric-dr.adoc} to facilitate this process.

*Connect to the Classroom: Using the Design Recipe to Help a Student*

- Hey teacher! I'm trying to write these examples. I don't know what the function name is!
- Hey, Teacher! What do I have to give it? It's a number a string, right? Now, wait... two strings? I give it two strings?
- Teacher, I'm stuck again. I don't know what to put for "function produces!"
- I need to write my second example. Wait, I forgot the name of my function!
- I forgot how many inputs it takes. Help!
- Am I ready to define my function? Am I ready to move on? Or is there something I need to do before I move on?
- Wait, what should I name my variables?

@pd-slide{

*Connect to the Classroom: Using the Design Recipe to Help a Student*

It is natural to go a couple of steps forward and then realize that there was something missing and to go back and get it. It's important that students know that they can do that!

We are turning children into word problem compilers. They are seeing this big messy word problem. Each step in the recipe forces them to make it a little more formal.
}

@pd-slide{

*Connect to the Classroom: The Design Recipe's Value*

The takeaway here is that if a student has a good contract and purpose, they actually can't fail.

No matter how many questions they ask, we can say: check your contract, check your domain, check your range, look at your purpose statement, what did you circle?

This is cool because all they have to do is restate the problem and know what the domain and range are and everything else is just grunt work. All the thinking happens here; everything else is just formalizing that thinking!
}


@pd-slide{

Let's connect this back to the best practices in math that many of you probably already do.

- If you tell kids to show their work, you're already asking them to write examples.
- If you tell kids to start concrete and get abstract, or to connect multiple representations, then the Design Recipe should feel familiar.
- If you're spending time in your classroom having kids explain their thinking, that is time that can be spent working on the Design Recipe.
- Whatever time you're spending helping kids figure out where to start... you get all that time back. Because now they will always know where to begin – with the contract!

While most problems in a math book ask students to _solve_ something, the actual challenge is figuring out _what the equation is that needs to be solved:_ setting it up is where the thinking happens, and solving it is just arithmetic.

To help you apply the Design Recipe to more of your scope and sequence, we've provided a library of Design Recipe worksheets which connect to various curricular goals. We hope that you will be inspired by this library, and begin using the Design Recipe with more of the problems in your book!
