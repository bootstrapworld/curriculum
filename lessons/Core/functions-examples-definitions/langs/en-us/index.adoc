== Three Representations of a Function

=== Overview
Students will practice describing functions using all 3 representations (in programming syntax), and test their code against the examples in the editor.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{bc}. Look at the Contract, some Examples, and the Function Definition for `gt`.
- What do you Notice? What do you wonder?
}

@slidebreak

We know that...

@n Every @vocab{function} has a @vocab{Contract}.

@indented{@show{(contract "gt" '("Number" ) "Image")}}

@n We can write @vocab{examples} illustrating how a @vocab{function} should work to help us identify the pattern.

@indented{@image{images/examples.png, 400}}

@n @vocab{Function definitions} replace whatever changes in the @vocab{examples} with a @vocab{variable} describing what changes.

@indented{@image{images/gt-fun.png}}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
If we use the correct syntax, we can include all three of these function representations in our @proglang files. Let's take a look!

Click "Run".
}

@QandA{

@ifproglang{pyret}{ 
@Q{What message do you get back?}
@A{Looks shipshape, all 5 tests passed, mate!}
@Q{What do you think that message means?}
@A{The editor has checked to see whether the 5 examples work with the function definition and they do!}
}
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
Change the *second* `10` to a `15` in the example below, then click "Run" again.

@show{(code '(EXAMPLE (gt 10) (triangle 10 "solid" "green")))}

@Q{What happens?}
@A{The editor lets us know that it has checked what the function would return for each expression against what the examples say it should and they don't match - it's letting us know so that we can fix our mistake!}
}

@lesson-point{
Examples not only help us to identify the pattern to define a function, they also let us double check that the functions we define do what we intend for them to do!
}

@strategy{The Road to Word Problems}{
_Modeling_ is the essence of word problems in Algebra: given a particular story, students are asked to (1) identify the underlying functional relationship at work and (2) use that function with the right input, to produce the right output. For students who are comfortable with basic arithmetic, the second step is relatively easy. _Setting up the equation in the first place_, however, is where many students struggle!

Functions can be thought of in multiple representations. In a typical K12 math class, students confront functions in the form of:

- A mapping between Domain and Range
- A ordered pairs of inputs and outputs
- A symbolic formula
- A line on a graph

At this point in the lesson, Bootstrap students will have seen the first three (framed as @vocab{contracts}, @vocab{examples}, and @vocab{definition}).

In the lessons that follow (@lesson-link{functions-dr, Solving Word Problems} in particular), students will learn how to create these representations from scratch, and how to _combine_  into a powerful modeling tool for solving word problems, called the *Design Recipe*. This will require them to understand the connections between representations, and how one can be used as a scaffold or assessment of the others.

For now, however, the goal is simply about understanding _what these representations are_ at a high level, and get comfortable matching them.

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
Think about these three representations of functions by completing:

- @printable-exercise{match-examples-contracts.adoc}
- @printable-exercise{match-examples-definitions.adoc}
- @printable-exercise{create-contracts-examples.adoc}
}

@teacher{There are many more materials for students to work with in the Additional Practice section at the end of the lesson, including a Desmos card sort!}

=== Synthesize

- What strategies did you use to match the @vocab{examples} with the @vocab{contracts}?
- What strategies did you use to match the @vocab{examples} with the @vocab{function definitions}?

== Defining bc and Other Functions

=== Overview
Using `gt` as an example, students will write the @vocab{Contract}, @vocab{examples}, and @vocab{definition} for several other @vocab{functions}.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{contracts-examples-definitions.adoc}
- On the top half of the page, you will see the Contract, examples, and function definition for `gt`.
- Circle what is changing and label it with the word `size`.
- Using `gt` as a model, complete the Contract, examples and function definition for `bc`.
- When you're done, type the Contract, Examples and Definition into the Definitions Area, click “Run”, and make sure all of the examples pass!
}

@teacher{
Check-in with students to gauge their confidence level. (Thumbs up? Thumbs to the side? Thumbs down?)... 

If they were given a word problem about another shape function, how confident are students that they could write

- the @vocab{Contract}
- @vocab{Examples} 
- the @vocab{Function Definition} 

}

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{contracts-examples-definitions-stars.adoc}.
- Complete @printable-exercise{contracts-examples-definitions-name.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
As students work, walk around the room and make sure that they are circling what changes in the @vocab{examples} and labeling it with a @vocab{variable} name that reflects what it represents.
}

@strategy{Optional Project: Create Your Own Function}{
In this lesson, students defined functions given a specific set of parameters. In @lesson-link{project-function}, students get additional practice thinking about functions before developing and defining a function of their own.
}

=== Synthesize

- How were each of the representations helpful?
- Why is it important to write examples in our code?
