Make sure you’ve loaded @starter-file{editor}, clicked “Run”, and are working in the @vocab{Interactions Area} on the right. Hit Enter/return to evaluate expressions you test out.

== Strings

_String values are always in quotes._

** Try typing your name _(in quotes!)_.

** Try typing a sentence like "I'm excited to learn to code!" _(in quotes!)_.

** Try typing your name with the opening quote, but _without the closing quote._ Read the error message!

** Now try typing your name _without any quotes._ Read the error message!

@n Explain what you understand about how strings work in this programming language.

== Numbers

@n Try typing `42` into the Interactions Area and hitting “Enter”. Is  `42`  the same as  `"42"`  ? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. 42 is a number and "42" is a string.}}

@n What is the largest number the editor can handle?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I didn't find a number that was too big!}}

@n Try typing `0.5`. Then try typing `.5`. Then try clicking on the answer. Experiment with other decimals. +
Explain what you understand about how decimals work in this programming language. @fitb{}{}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Regardless of how we type it in, the editor returns it with a zero in front of the decimal.}}}

@ifproglang{pyret}{@fitb{}{@ifsoln{In Pyret, decimals need to be typed with a zero in front of the decimal point.}}}

@n What happens if you try a fraction like `1/3`?
 @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@proglang will return the decimal equivalent. It even does repeating decimals!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Try writing *negative* integers, fractions and decimals. What do you learn? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@proglang can handle negatives.}}

@fitb{}{}

@ifproglang{pyret}{

== Operators

@n Just like math, Pyret has @vocab{operators} like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. +
Try typing in  `4 + 2` and then  `4+2`  (without the spaces). What can you conclude from this?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Operators require spaces.}}

@n Type in the following expressions, *one at a time*:  `4 + 2 * 6` @hspace{1em} `(4 + 2) * 6`@hspace{1em} `4 + (2 * 6)` @hspace{1em} What do you notice?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If you use more than one operator you have to insert parentheses to tell the computer which operation to apply first.}}

@n Try typing in `4 + "cat"`, and then `"dog" + "cat"`. What can you conclude from this?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{You can combine two strings, but you can't combine a number and a string.}}
