== Strings and Numbers @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Working together using a Driver/Navigator group setup, students experiment with the Editor. They explore Number and String data types, and how they behave in this programming language.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/driver-navigator.png, 150 }}
When programming in this class, you'll be working together using the _Driver/Navigator_ model. 

- Each group can only have one "Driver" - their hands are on the keyboard, and their job is to manage the typing, clicking, shortcuts, etc. 

- If you're not a Driver, you're a "Navigator" - your job is to tell the Driver where to go, what to type, etc. 

- A good Driver types only what the Navigator tells them to, and a good Navigator makes sure to give clear and precise instructions.

@strategy{The Driver/Navigator Model}{
This model of pair programming is extremely useful for teasing apart the "thinking" step from the "typing" one. Students - especially those who are new to text-based programming or typing itself - can struggle to put their thoughts into the programming environment. This model allows them to focus on _communicating their ideas_, but letting the Driver focus on the coding. Likewise, the Driver has a chance to focus on syntax and programming. Finally, the requirement that ideas are translated through another person's hands is an excellent scaffold for getting students talking about their thinking and about code.

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
Open @starter-file{editor}.
}

@right{@image{images/editor.png, 250}} This screen is called the @vocab{Editor}, and it looks something like the diagram you see here. There are a few buttons at the top, but most of the screen is taken up by two large boxes: the @vocab{Definitions Area} on the left and the @vocab{Interactions Area} on the right.

The @vocab{Definitions Area} is where programmers define values and functions that they want to keep, while the @vocab{Interactions Area} allows them to experiment with those values and functions. This is like putting a set of function definitions on the board, and having students use those functions to compute answers on scrap paper. 

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{
Anytime we open a file or make a change in the @vocab{Definitions Area}, we need to click "Run" to load the program.
}

Clicking "Run" will also clear the @vocab{Interactions Area}. For now, we will only be writing programs in the @vocab{Interactions Area} on the right.

=== Investigate

Math is a language, just like English, Spanish, or any other language. 

- Languages have *nouns* (e.g. “ball”, “tomato”, etc.) and *verbs*, which are actions we can perform on these nouns (e.g. - I can “throw a ball”). 
  * Math and programming have *values*, like the numbers 1, 2 and 3. 
  * Instead of verbs, math and programming have functions, which are actions we can perform on values (e.g. - “I can square a number”).

- Languages have rules for *syntax*. 
  * In English, for example, words don’t have `!` and `?` in the middle. 
  * In math and programming numbers don’t have `&` in them.

- Languages also have rules for *grammar*. 
  * _The cat sat._ is a sentence. 
  * _The sat cat._ is nonsense, even though all the words are valid syntax. 
  * The order of the words matters!

@slidebreak

Keeping the importance of *syntax* and *grammar* in mind is helpful when learning to program!.

@A{Check out the Synthesize section, below, for a list key takeaways from this activity.}
@Q{Did you get any error messages? What did you learn from them?}
@A{Most of the error messages we've seen were drawing our attention to @vocab{syntax errors}: missing commas, un-closed strings, etc.}
}



@ifproglang{pyret}{
@teacher{
Error messages are a way for Pyret to explain what went wrong, and are a really helpful way of finding mistakes. Emphasize how useful they can be, and why students should read those messages out loud before asking for help. Have students see the following errors:

- `6 / 0`. In this case, Pyret obeys the same rules as humans, and gives an error.
- `(2 + 2`. An un-closed quotation mark is a problem, and so is an unmatched parentheses.

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

You discovered these rules, on your own! We didn't tell you. Your kids will too. The purpose of this worksheet is to scaffold the inquiry just enough for them to feel this out on their own. Rules that they discover on their own, they will remember a lot better than rules that we put on a visual at the front of the classroom.

@slidebreak

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

We often don't think about what kind of values are reflected in the tools that we use. We *don't* want error messages to teach kids that mistakes are opportunities to be powerless.

That's why we spent a lot of time testing these error messages! We wanted to make sure that they are both readable but that they also use and teach vocabulary that is important for kids to learn.

@slidebreak

*Connect to the Classroom: Mistakes as Learning Opportunities*

This activity has a very specific intention. It is designed to let students practice (1) reading and interpreting error messages and (2) using driver/ navigator.

The section on Numbers, Strings, and Booleans can be done in a single class period. It is literally two worksheets that students do in small groups. But it is incredibly valuable.

You're teaching kids to read error messages and you're teaching them to be precise. Using driver/navigator helps to eliminate errors later.

=== Common Misconceptions

In Pyret, writing decimals as `.5` (without the leading zero) results in a @vocab{syntax error}. Make sure students understand that Pyret needs decimals to start with a zero!

== Booleans @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
This lesson introduces students to @vocab{Booleans}, a unique data type with only two values: "true" and "false", and why they are useful in both the real world and the programming environment.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
What's the answer: is 3 greater than 10?
}

Boolean-producing expressions are yes-or-no questions and will always evaluate to either `true` (“yes”) or `false` (“no”).  

The ability to separate inputs into two categories is unique and quite useful!

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/at-least-this-tall-to-ride.jpeg, 300 }}}
@ifnotslide{@right{@image{images/login.png, 300 }}}
For example:
Some roller coasters with loops require passengers to be a minimum height to make sure that riders are safely held in place by the one-size-fits all harnesses. The gatekeeper doesn't care exactly how tall you are, they just check whether you are as tall as the mark on the pole. If you are tall enough, you can ride, but they don't let people on the ride who are shorter than the mark because they can't keep them safe.

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/login.png, 300 }}}
Similarly, when you log into your email, the computer asks for your password and checks whether it matches what's on file. If the match is `true` it takes you to your messages, but, if what you enter doesn't match, you get an error message instead.
