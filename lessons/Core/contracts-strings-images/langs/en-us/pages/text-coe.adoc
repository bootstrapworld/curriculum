== Notice and Wonder

@do{
(define exp1 '(rotate 90 (text "Diego" 150 "yellow")))
(define exp2 '(rotate 45 (text "Shriram" 90 "purple")))

}

_Suppose we want to see the `text` "Diego" written vertically in yellow letters of size 150. Let's use Circles of Evaluation to look at the structure:_

[cols="^4, ^.^1,^5", grid="none", stripes="none", frame="none"]
|===

|We can start by generating the Diego image.
|
|And then use the `rotate` function to rotate it 90 degrees.

| @show{(coe '(text "Diego" 150 "yellow"))}  | &rarr; 	| @show{(coe exp1)}

| @show{(code '(text "Diego" 150 "yellow"))} | 			| @show{(code exp1)}

== Let's Rotate an Image of Your Name!

_Suppose you wanted the computer to show your name in your favorite color and rotate it so that it's diagonal..._

[.FillVerticalSpace, cols=".<1a, .<1a", stripes="none"]

| @n Draw the circle of evaluation to generate the image of your name in your favorite color.

| @n Draw the circle of evaluation to `rotate` it so that it's diagonal.
