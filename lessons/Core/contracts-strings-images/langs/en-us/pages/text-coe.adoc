_Suppose we want to see the `text` "Diego" written vertically in yellow letters of size 150. Let's use Circles of Evaluation to look at the structure:_

[cols="^4, ^.^1,^5", grid="none", stripes="none", frame="none"]
|===

|We can start by generating the Diego image.
|
|And then use the `rotate` function to rotate it 90 degrees.

| @show{(coe '(text "Diego" 150 "yellow"))}  | &rarr; 	| @show{(coe exp1)}

| @show{(code '(text "Diego" 150 "yellow"))} | 			| @show{(code exp1)}
