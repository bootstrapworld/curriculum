Alice's code has some new elements we haven't seen before, so let's experiment a bit to figure out how it works! *Open the @opt-starter-file{alices-restaurant}, click “Run”, and try using the `cost` function in the Interactions window.*

@vspace{2ex}

@n What does @show{(code '(cost "hamburger"))} evaluate to?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{6}}


@n What does @show{(code '(cost "pie"))} evaluate to?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{2.25}}


@n What if you ask for @show{(code '(cost "fries"))}?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_"Sorry, that's not on the menu!"_}}

@n Explain what the function is doing in your own words.

@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{Every if-expression has a test, which contains a Boolean expression. If the test is true, Pyret evaluates what comes after it. Otherwise, it evaluates whatever comes after 'else'.}
}

@n What is the function's name? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{cost}} @hspace{2em} Domain? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{String}} @hspace{2em} Range? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{Number}}


@n What is the name of its variable?
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{menu-item}}


@n Alice says onion rings have gone up to $3.75. Change the `cost` function to reflect this.


@n Try adding menu items of your own. What's your favorite? @fitb{}{}


@n For an unknown food item, the function produces the String `"That's not on the menu!"` Is this a problem? Why or why not?

@blanklines{5}{}


@n Suppose Alice wants to calculate the price of a hamburger, _including a 5% sales tax_. Draw a Circle of Evaluation for the expression below.

@ifsoln{
@vspace{4ex}

@show{(coe `(* 1.05 (cost "hamburger")))}
}
