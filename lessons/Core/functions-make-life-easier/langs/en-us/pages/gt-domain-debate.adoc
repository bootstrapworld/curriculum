= The Great gt domain debate!

[.indentedpara]
--
*Kermit*: The domain of `gt` is `Number, String, String`.

*Oscar*: The domain of `gt` is `Number`.

*Ernie*: I'm not sure who's right! 

[.indentedpara]
In order to make a triangle, we need a size, a color and a fill style... 

[.indentedpara]
but all we had to tell our actor was @show{(code '(gt 20))}...and they returned @show{(code '(triangle 20 "solid" "green"))}.

*Please help us!*

@n What is the correct domain for gt?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Number}}

@n What could you tell Ernie to help him understand how you know?

@blanklines{8}{
@ifsoln{`gt` _only takes in a number._ It feeds that number -- along with "solid" and "green" -- to the triangle function, whose domain is Number, String, String.}
}
