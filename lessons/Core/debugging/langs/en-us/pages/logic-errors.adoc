*Zahara was given this Word Problem:* 

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{_It's normal to tip 20% on a bill at a restaurant. Write a function that takes in the total on the bill, and returns the new total that adds a 20% tip._}

@vspace{1ex}

*And defined the following function to solve it:* 

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
@show{(code '(define (check-total bill) (* 0.2 bill)))}
}

@vspace{1ex}

*The function runs without any errors, but...*

@n Can you see what is wrong with this definition?

@fitb{}{
	@ifsoln{The function computes the tip, but does not add it to the price of the bill.}
}
@fitb{}{}
