*Louis was given this Word Problem:* 

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{_All students are given five (5) pencils at the beginning of the school year. Write a function called calc-pencils that takes in the number of students in the school and calculates the number of pencils needed for that school._}

@vspace{1ex}

*And defined the following function to solve it:* 

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
@show{(code '(define (calc-pencils p) (/ p 5)))}
}

@vspace{1ex}

*The function runs without any errors, but...*

@n Can you see what is wrong with this definition?

@fitb{}{
	@ifsoln{The word problem is supposed to take in the number of students and compute the number of pencils, but this does the opposite.}
}
@fitb{}{}

To explain their thinking, they filled out the following Design Recipe:

@n Read each step in the recipe carefully. In which step did their thinking first go wrong? (circle one)

@n What could they have done to find or avoid the mistake in the first place?
@fitb{}{
	@ifsoln{Their purpose was incomplete, and did not match the word problem.}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Thinking through a simple example with 1 student would have helped.}}
