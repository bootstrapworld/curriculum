*Sai was given this Word Problem:* 

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{_Write a function that returns the area of a circle given its diameter._}

@vspace{1ex}

*And defined the following function to solve it:* 

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
@show{(code '(define (circle-area diameter) (* (sqr diameter) pi)))}
}

@vspace{1ex}

*The function runs without any errors, but...*

@n Can you see what is wrong with this definition?

@fitb{}{
	@ifsoln{To compute the area of a circle, we need the radius - not the diameter. This code needs to divide diameter in half.}
}

@fitb{}{}

To explain their thinking, they filled out the following Design Recipe:

[cols="1a"]
|===
| @include{fragments/circle-area.adoc}
|===

@n Read each step in the recipe carefully. In which step did their thinking first go wrong? (circle one)

[cols="^1,^1,^1", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| Contract {amp} Purpose
| Examples {amp} Labels
| @ifnotsoln{Definition} @ifsoln{*_Definition_*}
|===

@n What could they have done to find or avoid the mistake in the first place?
@fitb{}{
	@ifsoln{They should have checked that their definition matched their examples.}
}
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Typing in the examples would automatically have generated a test failure!}}
@fitb{}{}
