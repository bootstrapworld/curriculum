    "description": "First Computer Bug. Moth found trapped between points at Relay # 70, Panel F, of the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator while it was being tested at Harvard University, 9 September 1947. The operators affixed the moth to the computer log, with the entry: First actual case of bug being found. (The term debugging already existed; thus, finding an actual bug was an amusing occurrence.)",
