@n On the line below, *write the Code* to define `PRIZE-STAR` as the pink outline of a size 65 star.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(define PRIZE-STAR (star 65 "outline" "pink"))) }}

@vspace{1ex}

Using the `PRIZE-STAR` definition from above, draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the Code for each of the exercises. +
Be sure to test out your code in @starter-file{editor} before moving onto the next item. One Circle of Evaluation has been done for you.
