= Defining Values in a Nutshell

In math, we use values, expressions and definitions.

- *Values* include things like: @hspace{1em} @math{-98.1} @hspace{1em} @math{\frac{2}{3}} @hspace{1em} @math{42}
- *Expressions* include things like:@hspace{1em}  @math{1 \times 3} @hspace{1em} @math{\sqrt{16}} @hspace{1em}  @math{5 - 2} 
  * These evaluate to results, and typing any of them in as code produces some answer.
- *Definitions* are different from values and expressions, because _they do not produce results_. Instead, they simply create names for values, so that those names can be re-used to make the Math simpler and more efficient.

  * Definitions always have both a name and an expression. 
  * The name goes on the left and is defined by an equals sign to be the result of a value-producing expression on the right: +
  @math{x = 4} +
  @math{y = 9 + x}
  * The above examples tells us: +
  "x is defined to be 4." +
  "y is defined to be 13." 
  * *Important: there is no "answer" to a definition*, and typing in a definition as code will produce no result.
  * Notice that _once a value has been defined, it can be used in subsequent definitions_. In the example above... + 
  The definition of `y` refers to `x`. +
  The definition of `x`, on the other hand, _cannot_ refer to `y`, because it comes before `y` is defined. 

@ifproglang{pyret}{
In Pyret, definitions are written the _exact same way_!
}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
In WeScheme, these definitions are written a little differently, making it clear that we're talking about definitions:

- Try typing these definitions into the Definitions Area on the left, clicking "Run", and then _using_ them in the Interactions Area on the right.

  * @show{(code '(define x 4))}
  * @show{(code '(define y (+ 9 x)))}

Just like in math, definitions in our programming language can only refer to previously-defined values.

@vspace{1ex}

- Here are a few more value definitions. Feel free to type them in, and make sure you understand them.

  * @show{(code '(define x (+ 5 1)) )}
  * @show{(code '(define y (* x 7)) )}
  * @show{(code '(define food "Pizza!") )}
  * @show{(code '(define dot (circle y "solid" "red")) )}
