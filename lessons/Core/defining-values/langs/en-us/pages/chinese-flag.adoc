@n Write the code to *define a value* for the repeated expression.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(define yellow-star (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))) }}

@n Open the @starter-file{flags-china}, *save a copy* and click "Run". *Simplify the code*, replacing the repeated expressions with the value you defined. Do you still get the same image when you click "Run"? If not, check your work.

@n Change the color of all the stars to black, then change their size to 20. Would this have been easier with the original code? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The original code would have been harder, because the change needed to be made in many places.}}

@n Here is the same code shown above, but all crammed into one line.

@show{(code '(define china
  (translate
     (rotate 40 (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))
     120 175
     (translate
       (rotate 80 (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))
       140 150
       (translate
          (rotate 60 (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))
          140 120
          (translate
             (rotate 40 (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))
             120 90
             (translate
                (scale 3 (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))
                60 140
                (rectangle 300 200 "solid" "red"))))))))}

@hspace{1em}Is it easier or harder to read, when everything is all on one line? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Much harder!}}

@n Professional programmers _indent_ their code, by breaking long lines into shorter, more readable lines of code. In the indented code at the top of the page, notice that each `translate` is followed by several lines of code that all line up with each other, and that the lines under the _next_ `translate` are shifted farther and farther to the right. What do you think is going on?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The lines under each `translate` are all inputs to that function.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Each new `translate` happens _inside_ the one that comes before it, so the inputs shift farther and farther to the right}} +
@fitb{}{}

@star This file uses a function we haven’t seen before! _Hint: Focus on the last instance of the function._ What is its name? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`translate`}}. +
How many inputs are in its domain? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{4}}. What are the types of those inputs? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Image, Number, Number, Image}}
