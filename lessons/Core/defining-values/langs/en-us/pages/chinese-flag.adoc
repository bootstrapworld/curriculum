@n Write the code to define a value for the repeated expression.

@fitb{}{@showsoln{(code '(define yellow-star (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))) }}

@n Open the @starter-file{flags-china} and click "Run". +

** Type `china` into the Interactions Area and hit *Enter*.
** *Save a copy* of the file, and simplify the flag code using the value you defined.
** Click "Run", and confirm that you still get the same image as the original.
** Now change the color of all of the stars to black, in both files.
** Then change the size of the stars.

@n Why is it helpful to define values for repeated images?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{More efficient. Avoids mistakes. Easier to make changes. Easier to read the code.}}

@star This file uses a function we haven’t seen before! What is it? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{`put-image`}} Can you figure out its Contract? _Hint: Focus on the last instance of the function._
