# What's in Common? 

Take a look at the expressions below:

@ifproglang{wescheme}{

```
(star 50 "solid" "green")
(scale 3 (star 50 "solid" "green"))
(scale .5 (star 50 "solid" "green"))
(rotate 45 (star 50 "solid" "green"))
(rotate 45 (scale 3 (star 50 "solid" "green")))
```
- What code do they all have in common?
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
```
star(50, "solid", "green")
scale(3, star(50, "solid", "green"))
scale(0.5, star(50, "solid", "green"))
rotate(45, star(50, "solid", "green"))
rotate(45, scale(3, star(50, "solid", "green")))
```
- What code do they all have in common?
}

- What would happen if you were asked to change the color of all the stars to gold?

# What's in Common? 

Duplicate code is almost always bad! 

- __Readability:__ The more code there is, the harder it can be to read.
- __Performance:__ Why re-evaluate the same code a dozen times, when we can evaluate it _once_ and use the result as many times as we need?
- __Maintainability:__ Suppose we need to change the size of the stars in the examples above. We would have to make sure every line is changed, which leaves a lot of room for error.

# What's in Common? 

In math, if we **define** a value, like @math{x = 4}, we can **evaluate** expressions using that value, like @math{x + 2}.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
WeScheme uses the word "define" to make this even clearer! We can type `(define x 4)` to define `x` to be the value 4.
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
Pyret is no different!
}

# What's in Common? 

Open the @starter-file{defining-values} and complete @printable-exercise{pages/defining-values-explore.adoc} with your partner.

Add some definitions of your own in the Definitions Area. Be sure to click *Run* again before you try testing them out.

Then complete @printable-exercise{which-value-to-define.adoc}.

# What's in Common? 

- What data types can we define values for?

- What values did you decide to define? When might they be useful?

# Using Defined Values

Complete @printable-exercise{chinese-flag.adoc}

<!--
It will direct them to open the @starter-file{flags-china} once they complete the first half of the questions on the page.

# Using Defined Values

- Open a new file in @starter-file{editor} and name it sunny.
- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/coe-why-define-values.adoc}
- The first row of the table has been completed for you. Could I get a volunteer to explain what they see happening in that first row?
- What code is being replaced by `sunny`? 
- Write the code on the line provided in question 2. Then type it into the Interactions Area and click "Run".
- Define the value `sunny` in the definitions area.
- Complete the page and test your code in the editor.

<!--
The code for sunny is @show{(code '(radial-star 30 20 50 "solid" "yellow"))}
