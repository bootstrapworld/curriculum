Thomas David Petite

[.title]
Inventor, Wireless Mesh Networks

[.text]
Petite is one of the early inventors of wireless mesh networks, which allow our cell phones and other wireless devices to communicate. He holds over 40 U.S. issued patents and is a highly recognized inventor in the worldwide energy and communications community. A registered member of the Fond Du Lac Tribe and son of a Chippewa Chief from Wisconsin, Petite founded the Native American Inventors Association to support Native inventors with patenting. His love of technology started with taking apart radios and putting them back together with his Dad, a sonar engineer. He has written about how dyslexia and his short attention span were "mental challenges that have helped me to become who I am today, a downright stubborn American Indian Inventor that happens to be a business junkie, Innovator with over 100 patents worldwide."
