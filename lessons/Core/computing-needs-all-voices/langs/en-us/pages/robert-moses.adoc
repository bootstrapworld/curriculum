Robert Moses

[.title]
Educator and Civil Rights Leader

[.title]
Algebra Project Founder

[.text]
Born in 1935, Moses was raised in Harlem, where he played basketball and attended public schools. After earning his MA in philosophy from Harvard in 1957, he returned to New York City to teach math. The sit-ins called him to Mississippi, where he directed the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee’s Mississippi Voter Registration Project from 1961-1964 and was a lead organizer of the 1964 Mississippi "Freedom" Summer Project. His work to organize share croppers earned him a MacArther Fellowship in 1982. Believing math literacy to be one of the greatest civil rights issues of our time and a prerequisite for full citizenship in society, Moses used the funds to found the Algebra Project, which organizes communities to create a culture of literacy around Algebra and build a network of youth leaders across the country. Moses' pedagogy roots algebra in lived experiences, asking students to draw, write about and discuss patterns they observe before using symbols to represent them.
