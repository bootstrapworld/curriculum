Marine BioEngineer connecting AI, Data & Robotic Vehicles

[.text]
Dr. Kakani Katija is an active scientific diver, dedicated to developing underwater technologies to better observe biological and physical processes where they happen in the ocean. As lead engineer of the BioInspiration Lab at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, she and her team investigate ways that imaging can enable observations of life in the deep sea. They use robotic vehicles to collect underwater visual data and AI to automate its classification. Tools they've developed include DeepPIV, EyeRIS, FathomNet, ML-Tracking, Mesobot and LRAUV. They hope to spark collaborative research and engineering innovations. Before earning her PhD in Bioengineering from CalTech, Kakani studied Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington, researching the Mars Gravity Biosatellite.  She was named a National Geographic Emerging Explorer in 2011 for her investigation into the role swimming animals might play in mixing and moving the oceans and other large bodies of water. “The creatures in our seas could be as important to ocean circulation and global climate as the winds and tides,” she said. Originally from Hawaii, Kakani was also a member of the US International Figure Skating Team!
