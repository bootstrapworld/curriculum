Jerry Lawson

[.title]
video games, Electronic Engineer

[.text]
Long before PlayStation, X-Box, and Wii hit the scene, Lawson made it possible to play video games at home! His first grade teacher in Brooklyn suggested that he could be the next George Washington Carver and he remembers thinking, "I want to be a scientist. I want to be something.”  As a teenager, he earned money repairing televisions, gained an amateur ham radio license and built his own station at home. In 1976, Lawson led the team of engineers that developed "The Fairchild Channel F," the first video game console with removable cartridges, allowing users to have a library of games. Lawson and Ron Jones were the sole Black members of the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of early computer hobbyists and entrepreneurs that played an influential role in the development of the microcomputer revolution and the rise of that aspect of Silicon Valley.
