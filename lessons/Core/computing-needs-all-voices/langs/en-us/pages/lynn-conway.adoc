Lynn Conway

[.title]
Supercomputer Technology, Microchips

[.text]
Conway's career began at IBM Research in 1964, where she helped develop supercomputer technology. In 1968, when Conway told IBM about her planned gender transition, she was fired from the company. For the next thirty years, she continued revolutionizing microchip technology while working in what she calls "stealth mode", presenting herself as a cisgender woman. As she neared her retirement in 1998, she came out as transgender via her personal website and has since been an activist for transgender rights. In 2020, IBM publicly apologized to Conway; IBM's director stated that Conway "forever changed microelectronics, devices, and people's lives."
