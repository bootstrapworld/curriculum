Jon "Maddog" Hall is the executive director of Linux International, a non-profit group dedicated to spreading Free Open Source Software, which has been his focus since 1994.  Based in New Hampshire, Maddog has consulted with the governments of China, Malaysia, and Brazil, as well as with the United Nations. He is the co-founder of Caninos Loucos (bringing inexpensive, locally designed and manufactured single board computers to Brazil) and President of Project Cauā (whose goals are to help university students better afford an education while improving the support of small businesses in using their computers). Maddog began his career in commercial computing in 1969, and decided to publicly come out as gay at the age of 61. His efforts on all fronts are making the tech community stronger, smarter, and more connected.
