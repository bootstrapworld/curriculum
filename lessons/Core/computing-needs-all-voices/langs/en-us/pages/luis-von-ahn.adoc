[.name]
Luis Von Ahn

[.title]
Founder of reCAPTCHA, CEO of Duolingo

[.text]
Von Ahn's first claim to fame was his role in developing CAPTCHAs, computer-generated tests that humans can pass but that computers cannot -- for example, deciphering hard-to-read text or matching images. CAPTCHAs stop bots from perpetrating large-scale abuse on websites, such as buying huge amounts of tickets for resale by scalpers. Von Ahn, who was born and grew up in Guatemala City, is also the CEO of Duolingo, a language learning mobile app and website where users can learn over 30+ different languages. All of his work centers around his mission of building systems that "combine humans and computers to solve large-scale problems that neither can solve alone."
