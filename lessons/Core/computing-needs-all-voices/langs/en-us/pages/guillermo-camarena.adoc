[.name]
Guillermo González Camarena

[.title]
Electrical Engineer, Inventor

[.text]
In 1939, Guillermo González Camarena independently developed a trichromatic field-sequential color television system, which he patented at age 23. During his childhood in Mexico, Guillermo loved to tinker and invent toys powered by electricity -- including a radio transmitter at age 8 and a hobby radio at age 12. Guillermo also loved music and folklore, and composed his own songs. His best-known song is called "Río Colorado," and the royalties he collected from it allowed him to develop his color TV system.
