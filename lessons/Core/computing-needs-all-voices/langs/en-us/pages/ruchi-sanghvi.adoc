Ruchi Sanghvi

[.title]
Computer Engineer, Business Woman

[.text]
Sanghvi was raised in the industrial town of Pune, India, where her father owns a company that lends equipment to industrial projects. Sanghvi recounts, "I've been obsessed with taking it over since I could talk. I'd follow him and repeat conversations about how many tons of cranes were arriving. He said it was a man's world, so I studied electrical engineering because it was related." After excelling in her studies at Carnegie Mellon, Sanghvi was hired as one of Facebook’s founding engineers -- as well as the company’s first female engineer. Her first big project was as a lead developer of Facebook's Newsfeed. As a result of Sanghvi's work (and the increased site traffic that resulted), newsfeeds have since become a common feature of social networking sites. Since her days at Facebook, Sanghvi has also served as an investor and advisor to a number of Silicon Valley companies.
