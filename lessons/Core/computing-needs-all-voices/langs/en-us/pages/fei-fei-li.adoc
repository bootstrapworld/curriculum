Fei Fei Li

[.title]
A "Godmother" of Artificial Intelligence

[.text]
Born in Sichuan, China, Li moved to the US with her family in high school and learned to speak English. While attending Princeton University, she returned home on weekends to help run the family drycleaning business. Li's curiosity for exploring the most challenging questions in nature led her to pursue research in how the brain works... and eventually led her to artificial intelligence. Dr. Li earned her PhD from the California Institute of Technology. Now a leading expert in the branch of AI known as computer vision, one of her many contributions to the field includes leading the effort to create ImageNet - a database of hundreds of thousands of labeled images used to train computer vision algorithms to recognize objects and the contexts they appear in. She continues her research as Co-Director of Stanford University’s Human-Centered AI Institute. One of her hopes is that as computers learn to “see”, they will help humans do things like make medical diagnoses and drive more safely. Dr. Li has been working with policy makers in the US and at the UN to ensure the responsible use of technologies. In 2023 she published "The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration and Discovery at the Dawn of AI". Li also cofounded AI4ALL, a non-profit organization that encourages diverse groups of high school students to become involved in artificial intelligence.
