Fei-Fei Li

[.title]
A "Godmother" of Artificial Intelligence

[.text]
Born in Sichuan, China, Li learned to speak English when she moved to the US with her family in high school. While attending Princeton University, she returned home on weekends to help run the family dry cleaning business. Li's curiosity for exploring the most challenging questions in nature led her to pursue research in how the brain works... and eventually to artificial intelligence. Now a leading expert in the branch of AI known as computer vision, she led the effort to create ImageNet - a database of hundreds of thousands of labeled images used to train computer vision algorithms to recognize objects and the contexts they appear in. One of her hopes is that as computers learn to “see”, they will help humans do things like make medical diagnoses and drive more safely. As Co-Director of Stanford University’s Human-Centered AI, Dr. Li works with policy makers in the US and at the UN to ensure the responsible use of technologies. Her book "The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration and Discovery at the Dawn of AI" was published in 2023. Li also cofounded the non-profit AI4ALL to encourage diverse groups of high school students to become involved in AI.
