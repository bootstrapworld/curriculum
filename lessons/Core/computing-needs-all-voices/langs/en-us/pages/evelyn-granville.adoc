Evelyn Granville

[.title]
Mathematician, Computer Scientist, Educator

[.text]
Granville worked for NASA, writing computer programs that tracked the paths of vehicles in space.  Before that, she taught at Fisk University, a highly rated Historically Black University in Nashville.  When Granville earned her PhD in Mathematics from Yale University in 1949, she was the second African-American woman to receive an advanced degree in math from an American University. In reflecting on her childhood, Granville recounts, "We heard about and read about individuals whose achievements were contributing to the good of all people. These individuals, men and women, served as our role models; we looked up to them and we set our goals to be like them. We accepted education as the means to rise above the limitations that a prejudiced society endeavored to place upon us."
