| Lesson Goals
| Students will understand that:

@objectives
@objective{There are programmers of wide-ranging racial, ethnic, gender and sexual identities.}
@objective{Programming is creative and collaborative.}
@objective{Programming is useful in a wide range of fields.}
@objective{People who wrote the sophisticated programs we use every day started out writing simple programs.}
@objective{There are lots of programming jobs, but not enough programmers to fill them.}
@objective{Teams benefit from diversity.}

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
- Let's learn about some Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics and what they contributed.
- Let's explore some concrete ways in which teams benefit from diversity.
- Let's learn about how programming impacts our lives and things that we care about.

| Preparation
|
@preparation{
- Figure out what structure you will use to engage students with  @printable-exercise{computing-pioneers.adoc, these pioneers}. If a gallery walk works for your students, print a set of our posters. 
- Make a copy of the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16tCvWZmTvHrztrVvQeInusQovwoK61WLsg3OTV0VIwg/copy, Ketchup Use Survey Google Form} so that you can examine your class's data. _If you are using our Google Slides, be sure to add the link to your copy of the form to the appropriate slide._
- *Have you established a classroom culture in which students will feel safe sharing their lived experiences with a partner?* If not, plan to shift the Windows and Mirrors portion of this lesson (and the Google Slides if you're using them) to a whole group discussion in which students can opt in or out of sharing their reflections.
- Choose a gentle timer sound on your phone, to facilitate transitions while students are sharing personal experiences.

== Who writes the Code?

=== Overview
Students watch a 5-minute video, hearing from programmers about how they got their start and seeing some of their projects and work environments. Then, students engage in a gallery walk of computing pioneers. Finally, students reflect on how what they've seen connects to their own identify and also helps them to understand the broader world.

=== Launch

@teacher{
Explain to students that they are going to watch a short clip and then share what they noticed and wondered. They may either record their thoughts as they watch, or do so for a few minutes after the film is over.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- We're going to watch @online-exercise{https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc, What Most Schools Don't Teach}.
- When we're done you'll have a few minutes to write down what you @printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc}.
  * Notice's should be statements about what stood out to you, or what you remembered, not questions.
  * If the video sparks questions for you, write them down under the "Wonder" section.
- If you'd like to record your thinking while the video is play, that's OK, too.

@QandA{
@Q{What did you notice?}
@Q{What did you wonder?}
}

@strategy{Pedagogy Note: Notice and Wonder!}{


This pedagogy is a @link{https://sadlerscience.com/notice-and-wonder/, widely-used best practice in Math-Ed}, and is used throughout this course. In the "Notice" phase, students are asked to crowd-source their observations. No observation is too small or too silly! By listening to other students' observations, students may find themselves taking a closer look. The "Wonder" phase involves students raising questions, but they must also explain the context for those questions. Sharon Hessney (moderator for the NYTimes excellent @link{https://www.NYtimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's Going On in This Graph?} activity) sometimes calls this "what do you wonder...and *why*?". Both of these phases should be done in groups or as a whole class, with adequate time given to each.
}

=== Investigate

@ifnotslide{
Assuming that you have printed and hung posters of @link{pages/computing-pioneers.html, Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics} for a gallery walk:


@lesson-instruction{
- There are posters of Mathematicians and Programmers hanging around the room.
- When I ask you to get up, you will head to the walls and have some time to move clockwise around the room to read them.
- Please spread out so that you can read the posters you are looking at.
}

Depending on your class and your timing, you may want to consider ending the gallery walk by having each student find a pioneer to present to the class.

If you aren't doing a gallery walk, decide on another format for engaging students with these pioneers.

@ifslide{
@centered-image{images/pioneers-header3.png}

We are going to take some time to explore these @link{pages/computing-pioneers.html, Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics Posters}.
}

=== Synthesize

@lesson-instruction{
Take a few minutes to reflect on the stories you've just encountered through the posters and the video by completing @printable-exercise{windows-mirrors.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
The next section of this lesson is an opportunity for students to learn and grow from sharing with each other. If you haven't yet established a classroom culture in which students will feel safe sharing their lived experiences with a partner, you may want to facilitate a whole group discussion instead in which students can opt in or out of sharing their reflections.

@lesson-instruction{
We are going to take turns sharing your windows and mirrors with your partners. +
@ifslide{ }
_This activity is all about holding space for someone else to share!_ 

- Each of you will get a minute to share your mirrors, then a minute to share your windows. 
- When it's your turn to speak, share what feels comfortable. You do not have to read what you wrote. 
- If it's your partner's turn and they finish before it's time to switch, leave space for them to think, and decide if they have anything else to add. 
- I will set a timer and let you know when it's time to switch. 
- You will have time to discuss after you've both had two turns to speak. 

Decide which of you will go first and raise your hand when you're ready.

@slidebreak

@ifslide{I will start the timer and you'll hear me give directions:}
@lesson-instruction{
- The first speaker now has one minute to share their mirrors.
- It's time to switch. The second speaker now has one minute to share their mirrors.
- It's time to switch. The first speaker now has one minute to share their windows.
- It's time to switch. The second partner now has one minute to share their windows.
- Thank you for taking turns listening, and holding space for one another. You now have 3 minutes to discuss and ask each other follow-up questions.

== Where would you look for the ketchup?

=== Overview

Students will complete a 30-second survey about how ketchup is used in their home, read a short article that uses ketchup placement in the kitchen as a metaphor for describing the advantages of diversity on a team when it comes to problem solving, reflect on the article, and then Notice and Wonder about the results of the class' ketchup survey.

=== Launch
@teacher{
Be sure to copy the google form below and update the link before sharing it, so that you can look at your data as a class!
}

@lesson-instruction{
Complete this two-minute @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16tCvWZmTvHrztrVvQeInusQovwoK61WLsg3OTV0VIwg/copy, Ketchup Use Survey}.
}

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Read @handout{ketchup-problem.pdf, LA Times Perspective: A solution to techâ€™s lingering diversity problem? Try thinking about ketchup}.
- After you've read the brief article, complete @printable-exercise{reflection-ketchup.adoc}.
}

@teacher{Facilitate a conversation with your students about their reflections on the article. Then display the results of the google form (as pie charts) and facilitate a discussion. What do students Notice? What do they Wonder?}

=== Synthesize

- Had you ever considered that different people keep their ketchup in different places in the fridge?
- Did considering differences in people's kitchens make you have any other thoughts you'd like to share?
