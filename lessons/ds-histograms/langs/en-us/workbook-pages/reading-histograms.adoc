= Reading Histograms

// use double-space before the *bold* text to address a text-kerning bug in wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 (with patched qt)
Students watched 5 videos, and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10. While the  *average score* for every video is the same (5.5), the *shapes* of the ratings distributions were very different! Match the summary description (left) with the histogram of student ratings (right). For each histogram, *the x-axis is the score, and the y-axis is the number of students who gave it that score*.
