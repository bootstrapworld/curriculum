* Analyze the work of another and provide constructive feedback
* Identify and correct syntax errors independently

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can analyze someone else's work and give them useful feedback
* I can find and correct errors in code myself.

|
* This task provides many opportunities for the facilitator to probe student understanding through questioning and observation.
* There may be more than one way to correct some of the errors.
* This lesson can also be facilitated without computers by asking students to correct and comment on code that has been printed out.
