= Adding Levels

@description{Students parameterize other parts of their
game, so that the experience changes as the score increases. This
track delves deeper into conditionals and abstraction, offering
students a chance to customize their games further while applying

== Adding Levels

=== Overview
This activity introduces a programming pattern to add _levels_ to students' games. For now, the only thing a level does is change the background - but students can easily extend this to change other aspects of the game.

=== Launch
You can add depth to your game by adding _levels_. In this lesson, we’ll cover making new levels based on the game’s score. To start, we want @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=0B9rKDmABYlJVVkpkTmEyd1ZTaE0,our Ninja Cat game} to have a different background image when the player progresses to the next level. We’ll say that *the player reaches level two when his or her score is greater than 250*.

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Where do you define the `BACKGROUND-IMG` image in your game?
- Keep your original background for the first level, but define a new variable `BACKGROUND2-IMG`, that will be used for level 2.
- For the best results, use an image that is the same size as your original background.
}

@slidebreak

Once you have your second background image, it should be drawn into the game  -- but only when a certain condition is met. Think back to the @vocab{helper function} we wrote to @lesson-link{re-functions-that-ask-questions, change the color} of the sunset animation in @lesson-link{re-build-your-own-animation}.

We need to do the same thing here!

@lesson-instruction{
- What must be true for the player to progress to level 2?
- Write a function draw-bg, which consumes the score and produces the appropriate background image.
}

Now that we have our helper function, we can use it to draw of that one part of the animation. Instead of blindly putting `BACKGROUND-IMG` into our function, now we’ll use `draw-bg(g.score)`:


@slidebreak

```
fun draw-state(g):
  translate(text(
  string-append("NinjaCat! Score: ", num-to-string(g.score)),
            20, "white"),
      310, 470,
      translate(
      text("Use arrow keys to move. Jump on the dog & catch the ruby!",
            12, "white"),
        320, 450,
        translate(PLAYER-IMG, g.playerx, g.playery,
          translate(CLOUD-IMG, 150, 350,
            translate(RUBY-IMG, g.targetx, g.targety,
              translate(DOG-IMG, g.dangerx, g.dangery,
                draw-bg(g.score)))))))
  ...
```

=== Investigate
Now our Ninja Cat game has a level 2! You can add more conditions to `draw-bg` to have multiple levels. You can use this same technique in lots of ways:

@lesson-instruction{
- Write `draw-player` and change `draw-state` so that have the Player transform if the score is above 250.
- Change your animation functions so that your characters move faster if the score is above 250.
- Add a special key (jumping? firing? warping?) that is only unlocked if the score is above 250.
}
