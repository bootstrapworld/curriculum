@description{This lesson removes earlier scaffolding from working with Reactors, having students brainstorm an original animation of their own and implement it from start-to-finish. This requires them to plan out what kind of data structure they will need, and how it will be drawn and updated.}

== Drawing with a Single Number

=== Overview
Students practice writing a simple function to draw the state of a Reactor, when that state consists of only a single number.

=== Launch
The majority of reactive programs you’ll write in this course will use data structures consisting of multiple pieces of data, whether that be Numbers, Strings, Images, or Booleans. However, it’s not _required_ to have a full data structure in order to use a reactor. In fact, we can create an animation based on just a single number!

@lesson-instruction{
Open the @starter-file{single-number} file and take a look at the code. Can you guess what this code will do?
}

[cols="1a,1a", frame="none"]

```
# next-state-tick :: Number -> Number
fun next-state-tick(n):
  n + 1
end

# draw-state :: Number -> Image
fun draw-state(n):
  "fix me!"
end
```
|
```
r = reactor:
  init: 1,
  # to-draw: draw-state,
  on-tick: next-state-tick
end

r.interact()
```

@slidebreak

Notice how there is no `data` block in this file. Both the `next-state-tick` and the `draw-state` function consume a *single number*, so the initial value given to the reactor is just a number (in this case, 1.)

@QandA{
@Q{Click "Run". What do you see?}
@A{Just a single number, increasing in increments of 1}
@Q{Why is the number increasing by 1?}
@A{That's what `next-state-tick` does}
@Q{Why don't we see any picture, or even the `"fix me"` from `draw-state`?}
@A{The reactor has the `to-draw` handler commented out.}
@Q{What do you think would happen if we had a reactor hooked up to a complete `draw-state` function, but a `next-state-tick` function that _never updated_ the state?}
@A{We'd see an image, but it would never change because the state doesn't change.}
}

@teacher{Reinforce the fact that, although the draw-state and next-state-tick functions work together within a reactor to produce an animation, each function can work without the other. In this example, next-state-tick will update the state even without a function to draw the state.}

There are much more interesting things we can display using a number as the state of the reactor, however!

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
- Change the `draw-state` function so that it consumes a Number and produces an image. You get to decide what the image is, as long as it uses that number in some way.
- Un-comment the `to-draw: draw-state` line in the reactor to see an animation when the program runs!
}

Some ideas, to get you started:

- Draw a star of size `n`, so that it gets larger on each tick
- Display `n` as an image using the `text` function

@teacher{Have students share back the draw-state functions they wrote.}

== Drawing with Two Numbers

=== Overview
This activity turns up the cognitive load: students practice writing a function to draw the state of a Reactor, when that state consists of a structure containing two numbers.

=== Launch
You’ve practiced writing a `draw-state` function using a single number as a state, now let’s look at something a bit more familiar.

@lesson-instruction{
Open the @starter-file{two-number} and take a look at the code.
}

[cols="1a,1a", frame="none"]
|===
|
```
data AnimationState:
  \| state(
      a :: Number,
      b :: Number)
end

START = state(1, 100)

# next-state-tick :: AnimationState -> AnimationState
fun next-state-tick(s):
  state(s.a + 1, s.b - 1)
end
```
|
```
# draw-state :: AnimationState -> Image
fun draw-state(s):
  "fix me!"
end

r = reactor:
  init: START,
# to-draw: draw-state,
  on-tick: next-state-tick
end

r.interact()
```

@slidebreak

This code includes a data structure (called `AnimationState`) containing two numbers as its fields, `a` and `b`. As before, the `draw-state` function is incomplete, and commented out from the reactor.

@lesson-instruction{
Based on the `next-state-tick` function defined here, what do you think will happen when you hit "Run"? Discuss with your partner, then try it out!
}

With only the `next-state-tick` function, we can see the state updating, increasing the first number by 1 and decreasing the second number by 1 each tick.

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{
- How could you define a `draw-state` function to show something interesting when the program runs?
- Brainstorm with your partner, then change the existing, broken `draw-state` function to consume an `AnimationState` and produce an image.
- Un-comment the `to-draw: draw-state` line in the reactor, to see an animation when the program runs!
}

Some possible ideas for this activity:

- Display two shapes of size a and b, which get larger and smaller, respectively, as the reactor runs.
- Make a and b the (x, y) coordinates of an image, moving down and to the right across a background as the reactor runs.

=== Synthesize
Share back what you brainstormed, and then share the completed `draw-state` functions you wrote and the animations you created!
