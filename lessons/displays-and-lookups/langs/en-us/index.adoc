= Data Displays and Lookups

@add-to-lang{.row-n}

@lesson-description{Students use displays to answer questions, focusing on which displays make sense for the data they are working with. They also learn how to extract individual rows from a table, and columns from a row. }

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Given a human-language request for a data display involving the entire Animals Dataset, break it down into parts and generate the display.
* Given a Table, use the `row-n` method to extract any Row from that table
* Given a Row, use the column lookups to extract the value of any column in the Row

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's practicing making data displays to answer our questions about the data and retrieving information from tables.

| Preparation

* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs
* Computer for each student (or pair), with access to the internet
* link:{pathwayrootdir}/workbook/workbook.pdf[Student workbook], and something to write with
* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Animals Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1ZupMVPWvVUOM0HCWyA7cRBghSLKxPWv1, open a new one}

== Displaying Data @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students get some more practice applying the plotting functions and working with Contracts, and begin to shift the focus from _programming_ to _data visualization_. This activity stresses a hard programming skill (reading Contracts) with formal reading comprehension (identifying key portions of the sentence).

=== Launch
The Contracts page in the back of students' workbooks contains @vocab{contracts} for many plotting functions.

Suppose we wanted to generate a display showing the ratio of fixed to un-fixed animals from the shelter? How do we go from a simple sentence to working code that makes a data display?

[.lesson-point]
To make a data display, we ask "Which Rows?", "Which Column(s)?", and "What Display?"

@span{.right}{@image{images/AnalysisPipeline.png}}

. We start by asking *which rows* we're talking about. In this case, it's all the animals from the shelter.
. We also need to know *which column(s)* - or "which variable(s)" - we are displaying. In this case, it's the `fixed` column.
. Finally, we need to know *which display* we are using. Is it a histogram? Bar chart? Scatter plots are essential for displaying relationships _between_ columns, but the other displays only deal with one column. Some displays work for @vocab{categorical data}, and others are for @vocab{quantitative data}.

Once we can answer these questions, all we need to do is find the Contract for that display and fill in the Domain!

To display the categorical data, we can choose between pie and bar charts. Which one of these two is best, and why?
@span{.clear}{}

=== Investigate
Do you know what kind of data is used for each display?

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/type-v-display.adoc}, and see if you can identify what kind of data each display needs!

Let's get some practice going from questions to code, making visualizations.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/data-displays.adoc}, and see if you can fill in these three parts for a number of data display requests. When you're finished, try to make the display in Pyret using the appropriate function.

=== Synthesize
Debrief the activity with students.

Optional: As an extension, have students break into teams and come up with additional Data Display challenges, then race to see which team can complete the other team's challenges first!

== Row and Column Lookups @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to define values in Pyret, and practice by defining Numbers, Strings, and Images. They also learn how to define an individual row from a table in Pyret, and how to access a particular column from that row.

=== Launch
Have students open their saved Animals Starter File (or make a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1ZupMVPWvVUOM0HCWyA7cRBghSLKxPWv1, new copy}), and click “Run”.

Sometimes we have a value that we want to use again and again, and it makes sense to define a name for it. Every definition includes a _name_ and a _value_. In the code below, we have definitions for a String, a Number and an Image.

  name = "Flannery"
  age = 16
  logo = star(50, "solid", "red")

- What are the names given in each of these? __name, age, and logo__
- What are the values? __the String "Flannery", the Number 16, and an Image of a solid red star__

=== Investigate
We can even define Rows from our tables!

Tables have special functions associated with them, called @vocab{Methods}, which allow us to do all sorts of things with those tables. For example, we can get the first data row in a table by using the `.row-n` method:

  animals-table.row-n(0)

[.lesson-point]
Don't forget: data rows start at index _zero_!

[.lesson-instruction]
In the Interactions Area, use the `row-n` method to get the second and third data rows.

What is the Domain of .row-n? What is the Range? Find the contract for this method in your contracts table. A table @vocab{method} is a special kind of function which always operates on a specific table. In our example, we always use .row-n with the animals table, so the number we pass in is always used to grab a particular row from animals-table.

The code below will define the first row from the animals table:

  sasha    = animals-table.row-n(0)

Pyret also has a way for us to get at individual columns of a Row, by using a Row Accessor. Row accessors start with a Row value, followed by square brackets and the name of the column where the value can be found. Here are three examples that use row accessors to get at different columns from the first row in the animals-table:

  animals-table.row-n(0)["name"]
  animals-table.row-n(0)["age"]
  animals-table.row-n(0)["fixed"]

And of course, we can use our defined name, substituting it in place of all the redundant code:

  sasha["name"]
  sasha["age"]
  sasha["fixed"]

[.lesson-instruction]
- How would you get the `weeks` column out of the _second_ row? The third?
- Complete the exercises on @printable-exercise{pages/lookup-questions.adoc}.

Flip back to page 2 of your workbook and look at The Animals Dataset. Which row is animalA? Label it in the margin next to the dataset. Which row is animalB?  Label it in the margin next to the dataset.

Now turn back to your screen.
What happens when you evaluate `animalA` in the Interactions Area?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Define _at least_ two additional values to be animals from the `animals-table`, called `animalC` and `animalD`.

=== Synthesize
Have students share their answers, and see if there are any common questions that arise.
