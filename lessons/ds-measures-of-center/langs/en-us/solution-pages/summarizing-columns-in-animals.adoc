= Summarizing Columns in the Animals Dataset

Find the measures of center and spread to summarize the @fitb{20ex}{pounds} column of the Animals Table. 

Be sure to add examples to your Contracts page as you work.

@vspace{1ex}

== Measures of Center

The three measures of center for this column are: 

@vspace{1ex}

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"] 
|===

| Mean (Average)| Median | Mode(s)

| ~40.9 		| 13.4 	 | 6.5
|===

@vspace{1ex}

Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{higher}{[higher/lower/about equal]} compared to the median, this suggests this suggests the shape is @fitbruby{60ex}{skewed left}{[skewed right (or high outliers) / skewed left (or low outliers) / symmetric]}.

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Median | Q3 | Maximum

| 0.1	  | 4.3| 13.4	| 68 | 172
