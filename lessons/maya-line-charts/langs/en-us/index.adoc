@description{In today’s lesson, students will further explore the effects of deforestation by looking at modern day rates of deforestation in the Maya Bioreserve (MBR). Students will make line charts to compare the rate of deforestation for the Maya Biosphere Reserve (where deforestation is currently a practice) and compare it to modern-day Costa Rica (where reforestation policies are at work). Students will make connections between what happened to the Maya civilization and what lessons we can apply to modern-day environmental policies. By the end of class, students will learn about the extremely rapid rate of deforestation that is occurring in the Amazon in Brazil and will begin to draft an essay about the dangers of deforestation,  based on the lessons learned from the Maya civilization.

| Preparation
Be prepared to share the results of the surveys students conducted about what people know about the ancient Maya.

== Review

Have students complete the @printable-exercise{do-now.adoc}.

Debrief: Students turn and talk to share answers. Then, have students share out answers to their worksheet while you reveal answers at the front of the room.

[.lesson-instruction]
By now we should be able to answer our Big Questions:

- How can we learn about people about whom there are few written records?
- What caused the Maya empire to collapse?

== Deforestation & Reforestation

=== Overview
Students will learn to model change over time using line charts, looking at deforestation in the Mayan Biosphere Reserve, reforestation efforts in Costa Rica, and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

=== Launch

Today, we are going to begin to answer a new question: What can past civilizations like the Maya teach us about the environment’s role in a society’s survival?

Let’s first take a look at what the Maya forests look like today. Have the remaining Maya learned lessons from the past? Have they protected their forests?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Watch this 2-minute clip on the @online-exercise{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy2PFDxqmiY, Maya Biosphere Reserve} together and have students complete the first two questions on @printable-exercise{biosphere.adoc}.
- Read the article as a class.
- Complete a think aloud with students to complete the calculations.

=== Investigate

Now, let’s see how we could utilize our data science skills to visualize this data and learn more. What trend can we see in this data? What story does this data tell us?

TURN AND TALK: Earlier in this unit, we saw pie charts and averages. Does either of them seem useful for helping us see the effects of deforestation over time?

[.lesson-instruction]
- We're going to need a new kind of data visualization in order to examine change over time!
- A @vocab{line chart} is a display that uses lines to connect individual data points to show the progression of quantitative data over a specific time period.

Make a copy of the @starter-file{deforestation} and model how to create line charts together with the class.

*Making a Line Chart using Google Sheets:*

. Select the data you want to include in the line graph including the column titles.
. Go to “Insert” → “Chart”.
. In the Chart Editor, go to Chart Type and select the first chart under Line [Chart].
. Your line chart should appear.

[cols="1a,2a"]

[.lesson-instruction]
- With your partner, make a copy of @starter-file{deforestation} and complete the line chart for the first sheet (Deforestation Rate 1).
- Give me a thumbs up when you have it working.
- What if Guatemala didn’t protect the reserve? And the rate was more than 80 square miles per year? The second sheet (Deforestation Rate 2) models more rapid deforestation. How many square miles of forest are lost per year in this scenario? _200_
- Create a line chart for Deforestation Rate 2.
- Turn and talk: What do you notice?
- Complete @printable-exercise{deforestation.adoc} independently.

Check answers together as a class.

Is it possible for a country not to lose any forest? Or to actually have forest area increase instead of decrease? Let’s find out what another country is doing about deforestation.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{reforestation.adoc} and complete question 1 with your partner by reading the text and the line chart. Be prepared to share.

[.lesson-instruction]
- What is Costa Rica doing? What does this line chart show us?
- Do you think most countries like Costa Rica, working to protect forests?

Let’s take a look at what’s happening in another country nearby (Brazil) in the world’s biggest rainforest (Amazon).

[.lesson-instruction]
- Play Video: @online-exercise{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxyffwgxaRY, Fires in the Amazon Rainforest}
- Have students complete the remaining questions on @printable-exercise{reforestation.adoc}

Have students turn and talk and share out.
- What’s happening in Brazil?
- What is the root cause?

=== Synthesize

Have students think about the @opt-printable-exercise{journal.adoc, journal questions}.

- What did we learn about modern civilization today?
- How does this relate to the Maya?
- What evidence did we examine?
- What data science skills did we learn?

On the first day of this unit, you surveyed people you know about what they know about the ancient Maya. Turn to @printable-exercise{survey.adoc} and see if you can answer all the questions correctly yourself now.

_The answers are: [b, c, d, a, b]_

After students take that “quiz”, teacher summarizes not only how well the class did, but also how well the surveyed family etc. did:
It turns out that X out of XX knew that the Maya civilization began about 3,000 years ago. Y out of YY knew they lived in Central America, Z out of ZZ knew that their victims of human sacrifice tended to be warriors. A out of AA knew that the best way to learn about what the Maya ate is to study their bones, and B out of BB knew their civilization probably fell apart because of too much deforestation.

== Summative Project @duration{flexible...will not be completed in class today}

If we study the ancient Maya, we learn that cutting down too many trees can harm a civilization. The modern charts we have looked at show that some societies have learned this lesson, while others have not. History is important because it reminds us of what people before us have already learned. History plus data science help us explore how old lessons affect modern times.
