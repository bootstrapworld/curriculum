== The Commutative Property

=== Overview

Students analyze pairs of Circles to determine if they have been manipulated in a valid way. The Circles make visible the structural changes that occur when we apply the Commutative Property.

=== Launch

Build on prior knowledge by reminding students of the activity that they completed in the previous lesson. You might even refer to the list of category names that the class created, and then draw students’ attention to any category names that allude to or suggest the commutativity. (Any mention of “changing the order” is a strong hint that students’ have clued into the Commutative Property!)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Now, turn to Discover the Commutative Property. Look at the first problem. What do you Notice about the two Circles? What do you Wonder?
- Work through the remaining problems with your partner. Be sure to evaluate the circles to confirm if they produce equivalent outcomes.
- What did you observe about the Commutative Property?
** _Possible responses: In each of the examples, the values were the same and the Circle structure stayed the same - but the order of the values was different. The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not subtraction or division._

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to Commutative Property Table.
- How many different ways can you apply the Commutative Property? Draw as many different Circles of Evaluation as you can.

This activity is similar to one students’ completed during the Computation as a Circle Transformation lesson.  In both activities, students are developing equivalent expressions. That said, in this lesson, students cannot write down any equivalent circle; they must develop Circle Transformations that apply the Commutative Property.

Note that each of these Circles can be represented in at least one alternative way. Some circles, however, include subtraction and division. You may need to draw some students' attention to the operation as they rearrange the values inside the circle, helping them to notice that the Commutative Property does not apply for division and subtraction..

Rather than reminding students to "pay attention to the sign!", we recommend getting curious. For instance, ask, "What’s 8 divided by 4? And what do we get when we divide 4 by 8?""

=== Synthesize

- For which operations does the Commutative Property hold?
** _The Commutative Property holds for multiplication and addition, but not division or subtraction._
- When applying the Commutative Property, did the groupings of the numbers ever change?
** _No - when we apply the Associative Property, the order of the numbers should always remain the same._
- Which type of Circle could only be transformed once? Which type of Circle could you transform more than once?


== Putting it All Together

=== Overview

Students connect and apply what they have learned so far about translation, computation, and the Commutative Property.

=== Launch

Claire and Walker are translating expressions in words into Circles of Evaluation. Their teacher asks them to represent the following expression: "one half the product of five and six."

Claire draws this: ½ * (5*6)
Walker draws this: (5*6) * ½

[.lesson-instruction]
- Their teacher looks at their work. She definitely likes Claire’s answer, but she can’t decide if she should give full credit to Walker. What do you think? Let’s consider arguments both for and against.
** _Arguments for not giving Walker credit: The expression states that we start with one half, and then multiply that 5x6. Walker’s Circle is not a direct translation._
** _Arguments for giving Walker credit: When we use computation, both Circles evaluate to 15. Both Walker and Claire are taking half of 30. The Commutative Property indicates that we can multiply factors in any order._

In the end, the teacher decides that - although Claire’s Circle is a more direct translation - Walker has demonstrated (1) an understanding of the Commutative Property, and (2) an understanding of how to compute the solution using Circles. She decides to give him credit.

=== Investigate

Before moving on to the next activity, emphasize to students that Walker and Claire’s Circles do in fact represent different mathematical expressions - but that the transformations between those expressions are valid and reliable. Computation helps us to verify that!

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at this worksheet with some additional work by Claire and Walker. Remember, their teacher awards credit when her students either translate the expression precisely, OR when they show both a deep understanding of computation and the Commutative Property.
- In the column on the right, record if Claire, Walker, or both students drew a valid Circle representation of the expression in words.
- Optional: Complete the Challenge to analyze Circles of Evaluation and commutativity for a more complex expression in words.

Discuss and debrief with students. Invite students to verbally share their responses to reinforce important vocabulary and concepts that students will use again and again in future lessons.

=== Synthesize

Do you translate words into Circles precisely and directly–or do you sometimes make Circle Transformations as you translate? Why?

If you were a teacher, what would you require exact translations of circles, or would you allow students to apply Circle Transformations when translating?
