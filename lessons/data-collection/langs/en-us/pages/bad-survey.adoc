The @starter-file{bad-survey} has __lots__ of problems, which can lead to many kinds of dirty data: Missing Data, Inconsistent Types, Inconsistent Units and Inconsistent Language! Try filling it out with bad data. Record the problems and make some recommendations for how to improve the survey!

*NOTE: make sure your teachers gives you a link to their _own copy_ of the survey. You should be able to the data after you submit it!*

|Question
| What examples of bad data were you able to submit?
| How could the survey be improved to avoid bad data?

|*A*
| @ifsoln{*Inconsistent Types* I could enter 13 as an answer (a number), but I could also enter “teenager” (a string). This would mess up anyone who is trying to find the median age of the survey, for example. *Inconsistent Units* I could also enter "13 years" or "4,745 days".}
| @ifsoln{Add some kind of input validation so only valid answers can be submitted}

|*B*
| @ifsoln{*Inconsistent Types*  I could select 5 or 6, but I can also select both grades. That means the resulting column might have lots of numbers….and then a few cells that look like “5, 6” (a string).}
| @ifsoln{Use a dropdown, or some other format that only allows single responses}

|*C*
| @ifsoln{*Inconsistent Units* The questions for inches, but people don't always read carefully. There's nothing to stop someone from submitting "1.5" (maybe they're thinking of meters?) or "2000" (millimeters?).}
| @ifsoln{Add validation so impossible values get rejected}

|*D*
| @ifsoln{*Inconsistent Types* Nothing to stop someone from answering with numbers, strings, booleans, etc. *Inconsistent Units* Someone could easily answer with a number of inches, feet, meters, etc.}
| @ifsoln{Add some kind of input validation so only valid answers can be submitted}
