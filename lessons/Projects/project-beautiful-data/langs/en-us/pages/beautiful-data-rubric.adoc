| &#9744; Wow!
| &#9744; Getting There
| &#9744; Needs Improvement

| Get Inspired
| I found a terrific visualization and provided its title. I gave detailed reasons why it matters to me and what I like about it. I included clear reasons why the artistic quality of the visualization adds to its appeal and usefulness.
| I found a visualization that I liked and provided its title. I came up with at least one reason why it matters and what I like. I wrote something about how the creativity in the visualization adds to it.
| I found a visualization, but didn't say much about why I liked it or why it's creative.

| Find Your Data
| I found data and made a display that is interesting to me. I submitted my Pyret file so that my teacher could see the code used to generate the display. I wrote detailed reasons about why my data and visualization matter.
| I found data and made a display that is interesting to me. I submitted my Pyret file so that my teacher could see the code used to generate a display. I wrote something about why the data and/or the display are interesting.
| I found data and made a display, but did not describe why it was interesting to me.

| What Data is Missing?
| I thought of at least two columns in my dataset that would be really important to consider, in addition to the visualizations I made earlier. For each of those columns, I wrote a clear observation and question about how those columns might influence the visualizations.
| I thought of at least two columns in my dataset that matter, but had trouble explaining what my observation was or what the question about those columns might be.
| I could not think of two columns that mattered, so I picked them at random. I could not explain what the observation or questions would be.

| Make it Beautiful
| I included my custom display and submitted the Pyret file with the code used to make it. My customized display uses color, shapes, and/or images that are relevant to the topic, visually appealing, and make the data easier to understand. My writing clearly communicates all of this.
| I included my custom display and submitted the Pyret file with the code used to make it. My customized display uses color, shapes, and/or images that are relevant to the topic. I adequately describe what my code does.
| I included my custom display, but I am missing a description of what I did, or my customization isn't really relevant to the topic.
