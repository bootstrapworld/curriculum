== Function Refresher 1:  `maroon-square`

@link-instructions{Open the @starter-file{functions-study} and "Save a Copy".}
Before you click "Run", answer questions 1-3 by reading the Contract, Examples, and Definition for the function `maroon-square` in the Definitions area.

@n What is the Domain of `maroon-square`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a Number}}

@n What is the Range of `maroon-square`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{an Image}}

@n What do you expect the function `maroon-square` to do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The purpose statement says it should produce solid maroon squares of the given size, but the definition has it producing orange squares...}}

@n Click "Run". @ifproglang{pyret}{
What do you learn about `examples-block-1` when you click "Show Details"? 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The test failed because the left side (orange squares) don't match the right side (maroon squares)}}
} 
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
What happens?	
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The three examples failed at line 9, line 10, and line 11.}}
} 
}

@n What happens when you type @show{(code '(maroon-square 20))} in your Interactions Area and hit enter? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{I see an orange square.}}

@n Change the code in the Definitions Area so that all 3 @ifproglang{pyret}{tests in examples-block-1} @ifproglang{wescheme}{exmaples} pass when you click "Run" (and save your changes). What did you change? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Changed the color in the definition from "orange" to "maroon" to match the Examples and description.}}

== Function Refresher 2: `mystery`

@n What are the names of the 3 defined values at the beginning of this section? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`small-yt`, `big-bt`, `hello-text`}}

@vspace{1ex}

Let's examine what happens when we use each of those values as inputs for `mystery`. 

- Type `small-yt` into the Interactions Area and hit enter. 
- Then, test out @show{(code '(mystery small-yt))}. 

@n What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{I get a yellow triangle. And then a teal star with a purple rectangle and the same yellow star, but rotated a little.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{How much is it rotated? Why aren't all of the objects centered on the star? etc.}}

@n What do you expect to happen when you test `hello-text` and @show{(code '(mystery hello-text))}? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a pink "hello". And then a teal star with a purple rectangle and a diagonal pink "hello".}}

Note: If you like, you can run `mystery` with __any__ image-producing function!

@n In your own words, describe how the function `mystery` transforms its input. @fitb{}{}

@n Take another look at the `EXAMPLES` section. Notice how the programmer made use of indentation and new lines. Why do you think they wrote the code that way? @fitb{}{}
