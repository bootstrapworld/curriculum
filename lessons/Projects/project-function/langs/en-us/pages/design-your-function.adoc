In this project, you will develop and define a function of your own! This function must take in a shape and manipulate it using *at least three transformations*. This is the planning sheet. You will also create, save, and share a Pyret file with your teacher.

@n Put a checkmark by each of the shape functions that you plan to use in your personal function. *You must choose at least one.* If you plan to use a function multiple times, you can add additional checkmarks next to it.

@n What do you want your function to do?

- _Example: I want my function to take in a shape, double its size, turn it upside down, and center it on a solid blue square that's 100 pixels wide._

- I want my function to take in a shape, and then: @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}


@n Draw a sketch of the image you want your function to produce given each of the inputs below.
