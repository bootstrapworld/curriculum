= Designing Your Function

In this project, you will develop and define a function of your own! This function must take in a shape and manipulate it using **at least three transformations**. This is the planning sheet. You will also create, save, and share a Pyret file with your teacher.

@n Put a checkmark by each of the shape functions that you plan to use in your personal function. **You must choose at least one.** If you plan to use a function multiple times, you can add additional checkmarks next to it.

@n What do you want your function to do?

- Example: @fitb{}{_I want my function to take in any shape, and then: double its size, turn it upside down, and place it in the center of a solid blue square_}

@fitb{}{_that is 100 pixels wide._}

- Your response: @fitb{}{I want my function to take in a shape, and then: }

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}


@n Draw a sketch of what your function would produce for two different provided inputs.
