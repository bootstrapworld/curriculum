== Maroon Square

@n We're going to test out the function `maroon-square`. Let's think about its domain and range.

- What does `maroon-square` consume? @fitb{15em}{}
- What does `maroon-square` produce? @fitb{15em}{}

@n What do you think the function `maroon-square` does? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Let's test it out. Type @show{(code '(maroon-square 20))} in your Interactions Area, then hit enter. Repeat this for the other two examples that you see in the Definitions Area. What happens and why? @fitb{}{}

== Sample

@n On @ifproglang{pyret}{lines 23-27}@ifproglang{wescheme}{lines 17-23} some different values have been defined. What are their names? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Let's examine what happens when we use each of those values as inputs for `sample`. Hit "Run". Type `small-yt` into the Interactions Area and hit enter. Then, test out @show{(code '(sample small-yt))}. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{}

@n What do you expect to happen when you test `big-bt` and @show{(code '(sample big-bt))}? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n If you'd like, test out `hello-text` and @show{(code '(sample hello-text))}. You can run `sample` with __any__ image-producing functions.

@n In your own words, describe how the function `sample` transform its input. @fitb{}{}

@n Take another look at the `EXAMPLES` section. Notice how the programmer made use of indentation and new lines. Why do you think they wrote the code that way? @fitb{}{}
