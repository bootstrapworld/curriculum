| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| Sample Logo Study
| I thoroughly described my favorite logo and explained why I like it. I also listed each and every specific color, image-producing function, and transformation function that the programmer used. I did not omit any details.
| I described my favorite logo and explained why I like. When I listed the functions that the programmer used, however, I missed one or two.
| My description of why I like a certain logo was brief. My list of the functions used by the programmer left out three or more functions.

| Sketching my Logo
| My logo sketch is attractive and creative. Its design looks intentional. I've annotated the shapes and colors I plan to use.
| My logo sketch is attractive and creative, when I annotated, I forgot to label one or two shape and color names.
| My logo sketch look nice, but I forgot to annotate three or more shape or color names.


| Circle of Evaluation
| My Circle of Evaluation shows my very best attempt to compose the functions in my logo. I've followed the rules for creating a Circle. It is clear that I've used contracts to determine what belongs inside of each Circle.
| My Circle of Evaluation shows a solid attempt to compose the functions in my logo. I've followed the rules for creating Circles. There are no more than three Contract or Syntax errors.
| My Circle of Evaluation is hard to for the reader to interpret, and occasionally breaks rules for creating Circles. I have made four or more Contract or Syntax errors.

| My Logo Program Submission
| Running my code produces no errors. The image that I sketched (or something very close to it) appears after typing in `my-logo`. I've responded thoughtfully via comment to the two reflection questions.
| Running my code produces no errors. An attractive logo appears after typing in `my-logo`, but it doesn't quite resemble the sketch that I created. My responses to the reflection questions are brief.
| Running my code produces errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` doesn't at all resemble the sketch that I created. I forgot to include responses to the reflection question.
