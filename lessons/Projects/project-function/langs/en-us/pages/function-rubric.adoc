| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| Sample Function Study
| I reflected on `maroon-square` and clearly explained how it works. I made thoughtful observations about why code runs down and to the right, like a stair case. I demonstrated my understanding that `sample` consumes an image (produced by a shape function).
| My reflection demonstrated understanding of `maroon-square`, but I showed only a partial understanding of `sample`.
| I left parts of the page incomplete, or provided incorrect responses. It is unclear if I understand `maroon-square` and `sample`.

| Circle of Evaluation
| My Circle of Evaluation shows my very best attempt to represent my function. Every Circle has a function at the top, and one or more inputs at the bottom. My inputs are in the correct order, because I've used contracts to determine what belongs inside of each Circle. There are no syntax errors, because every String is in `"quotation marks"` and any decimals have at least one number to the left of the decimal point.
| My Circle of Evaluation shows a solid attempt to represent my function. I've followed the rules for creating Circles. There are no more than three Contract or Syntax errors.
| My Circle of Evaluation is hard to for the reader to interpret, and occasionally breaks rules for creating Circles. I have made four or more Contract or Syntax errors.

| My Logo Program Submission
| Running my code produces no errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` looks very close to my drawing. I've responded thoughtfully via comment to the two reflection questions.
| Running my code produces no errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` looks a little like my drawing. My responses to the reflection questions are brief.
| Running my code produces errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` doesn't really look like my drawing. I forgot to include responses to the reflection question.
