= Coding Your Function

== Represent Your Logo with a Circle of Evaluation

@n Draw a Circle of Evaluation to show how you will compose the functions you selected on @printable-exercise{../design-your-function.adoc} in order to create your function. If you need more space, use a separate sheet of paper. For your variable, you can just write the word "image".

== Peer Review

@n Swap papers with a partner. Write your name on the line so that your teacher knows who is reviewing this function. @fitb{}{}

@n Did your parter put a function at the top of each Circle? If no, explain what the problem is. @fitb{}{}

@n Are all of the inputs in the correct order? If not, which contracts does your partner need to revisit to solve the problem? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Are there any syntax errors (strings missing quotation marks, decimals without at least one number before the decimal point, etc.)? If so, where? @fitb{}{}

== Add Your Examples to Pyret

@vspace{1ex}

Open @starter-file{editor} on your computer.

@n In the Interactions Area, translate and type your Circle of Evaluation into code. Since you haven't defined your function yet, Pyret won't recognize `image` as your variable. You'll need to use a specific shape function (and its arguments!) instead. Test it out!

@n If you get an error, or if the function isn't working how you expected, try again until it works. Describe one adjustment that you made. @fitb{}{}

@n Once you've got the code working how you'd like, you're mostly done creating your first *_example_*! In the definitions area, type `my-function( )`. Inside the parentheses, provide _the input you just used_. Next, type in the word *is*, and then paste in the code you just wrote.

@n Repeat this process to create two additional examples. Don't forget to format the examples.

@n Once you have entered your three examples, be sure to hit run to confirm that Pyret likes your examples. You should see the message, "Looks shipshape, all 3 tests passed, mate!" If you encounter errors, try your best to fix them.
