= Coding Your Function

== Peer Review of Function Design


== Represent Your Logo with a Circle of Evaluation

@n Draw a Circle of Evaluation to show how you will compose the functions you selected on @printable-exercise{../design-your-function.adoc} in order to create your function. If you need more space, use a separate sheet of paper. For your variable, you can just write the word "image".

== Peer Review

@n Swap papers with a partner. Write your name on the line so that your teacher knows who is reviewing this function. @fitb{}{}

@n Did your parter put a function at the top of each Circle? If no, explain what the problem is. @fitb{}{}

@n Are all of the inputs in the correct order? If not, which contracts does your partner need to revisit to solve the problem? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Are there any syntax errors (strings missing quotation marks, decimals without at least one number before the decimal point, etc.)? If so, where? @fitb{}{}

== Put Your Logo's Code in Pyret

You'll need the @starter-file{functions} open on your computer.

@n In the Definitions Area (left side), type `my-logo =`, then translate your Circle into code and add it after `my-logo =`. This defines the variable name `my-logo` to be _your logo image_!

@n Test it out. Hit "Run", then type `my-logo` into the _Interactions Area_. If you get an error, or if the logo doesn't look like the one you drew, try again until it works. Describe one adjustment that you made. @fitb{}{}

@n Add a comment to the Definitions Area describing (1) why you designed your logo the way you did, and (2) one thing you learned from completing this project.

@n Save your program. Select "File", then "Save a Copy." Go to "Publish", and copy the link that appears. Follow your teacherâ€™s instructions and submit the link.
