= Coding Your Function (1)

== Represent Your Logo with a Circle of Evaluation

@n Draw a Circle of Evaluation to show how you will compose the functions you selected on @printable-exercise{../design-your-function.adoc} in order to create your function. If you need more space, use a separate sheet of paper. For your variable name, you can just write the `img`.

@n Did your parter put a function at the top of each Circle? If not, explain what the problem is. @fitb{}{}

@n Ask your partner to give you their copy of @lesson-link{project-function/pages/design-your-function.adoc}. Look at their responses for numbers 3 and 4. Do you think the code represented by the Circle of Evaluation above will do what they want it to do? If not, tell them what you think needs to change. @fitb{}{}
