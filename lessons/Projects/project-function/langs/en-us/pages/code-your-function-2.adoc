= Coding Your Function

== Translate Your Circle of Evaluation to Code

@n Code: @fitb{}{}

== Add Examples and Define Your Function

[linkInstructions]
Open @starter-file{my-function} on your computer. Sign in and save a copy.

@n Notice how we've defined two images (`pink-tri` and `yellow-rec`) at the top of the starter file. These are the images we will use to test out our functions. On line 6, type in a third image definition of your choosing. What function will you use? @fitb{}{}

@n In the Interactions Area, translate and type your Circle of Evaluation into code - but instead of using the word "image" as your input, type in one of the defined values.

@n If you get an error, or if you are not getting the result that you expected, try again until it works. Describe one adjustment that you made. @fitb{}{}

@n Once the code is working how you want it to, you're mostly done creating your first *_example_*! In the definitions area, type `my-function( )`. Inside the parentheses, provide _the input you just used_. Next, type in the word *is*, and then paste in the code you just entered.

- Repeat this process to create two additional examples with different inputs.
- Be sure to format your examples to make them more readable. (If you need help with formatting, you can refer to the @starter-file{functions}.)

@n After entering your examples, click "Run" to confirm that your tests passed in @proglang, with no error messages. @ifproglang{pyret}{You should see the message, "Looks shipshape, all 3 tests passed, mate!"}

@n Define `my-function` in @proglang. (If you don't remember how to define a function, you can refer to the @starter-file{functions}.)


== Peer Review

@n Swap papers with a partner. You'll also want to have your partner's @proglang program open. Write your name on the line so that your teacher knows who is reviewing this function. @fitb{}{}

@n Did your partner write 3 different and correctly formatted examples? If not, what was the issue? @fitb{}{}

@n When you click "Run", do you see @ifproglang{wescheme}{any error messages? If so,} @ifproglang{pyret}{the message, "Looks shipshape, all 3 tests passed, mate!"? If not,} work with your partner to find and fix the problem. Describe what was wrong, if there was a problem. @fitb{}{}
