== Add Examples and Define Your Function

@n In the Interactions Area, translate and type your Circle of Evaluation into code. Since you haven't defined your function yet, Pyret won't recognize `image` as your variable. You'll need to use a specific shape function (and its arguments!) instead. Give the code for the shape function and its arguments that you will use to test your code.

@n If you get an error, or if the function isn't working how you expected, try again until it works. Describe one adjustment that you made. @fitb{}{}

@n Once the code is working how you'd like, you're mostly done creating your first *_example_*! In the definitions area, type `my-function( )`. Inside the parentheses, provide _the input you just used_. Next, type in the word *is*, and then paste in the code you just entered.

@n Repeat this process to create two additional examples. Don't forget to format the examples to make them more readable. (If you need help with formatting, you can refer to the @starter-file{functions}.)

@n Once you have entered three examples, hit run to confirm that Pyret likes your examples. You should see the message, "Looks shipshape, all 3 tests passed, mate!"

@n Define `my-function` in Pyret. (If you don't remember how to define a function, you can refer to the @starter-file{functions}.)


== Peer Review

@n Swap papers with a partner. You'll also want to have your partner's Pyret program open. Write your name on the line so that your teacher knows who is reviewing this function. @fitb{}{}

@n Did your partner write 3 correctly formatted examples? If no, what was the issue? @fitb{}{}

@n Did your partner use 3 different inputs in their examples? @fitb{}{}

@n When you hit run, do you see the message, "Looks shipshape, all 3 tests passed, mate!"? If not, work with your partner to find and fix the problem. Describe what was wrong, if there was a problem. @fitb{}{}
