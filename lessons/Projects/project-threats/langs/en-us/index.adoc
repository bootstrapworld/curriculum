= Project: Threats to Validity

@description{Students investigate four types of threats to validity by pretending to be “bad data scientists” who fail to consider the impact of selection bias, bias in the study design, poor choice of summary data, and confounding variables.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* consider how threats to validity can emerge when research is conducted
* gain awareness of how data can be misconstrued


| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's be "bad data scientists"!

* Students will work with a partner for this project. You may assign partners, or allow students to choose.
* This project is designed to span approximately 2-3 class periods.

== Threats to Validity @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students develop a faulty research plan on a question of their choosing to demonstrate their understanding of four unique threats to validity.

=== Launch

Congratulations! You're a data scientist who has been granted funds to conduct research on a topic of your choosing! There's one complication...

You're a *BAD* data scientist!

For this project, you and a partner will develop a statistical question that you would be interested in exploring. It must be, however, a statistical question that lends itself to many threats needing to be addressed.

@teacher{Note: We recommend printing and distributing the student-facing @handout{rubric-threats-to-validity.adoc} to help students understand the scope of the project - and your expectations - at the outset. Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the rubric for their unique classroom context.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Review with your partner the four threats to validity to ensure that the two of you understand what each one entails.
- With your partner, agree on a statistical question that will lend itself to these threats to validity.
- Record your question on @opt-printable-exercise{threats-project-notes.adoc}.
}

@teacher{As a class, invite students to share their questions and begin to consider how they might incorporate the threats to validity. You'll want to ensure that students have developed appropriate questions before moving onto the next portion of the project.}

@lesson-instruction{
- With your partner, develop a brief research plan and record it on @opt-printable-exercise{threats-project-notes.adoc}.
- Complete the rest of the page, describing in detail how you plan to misrepresent your data.
}

=== Investigate

It's time to do some analysis!

@lesson-instruction{
- In the first column of @opt-printable-exercise{threats-project-notes-2.adoc}, explain how the validity of your conclusions will be impacted by selection bias, bias in the design study, poor choice of summary data, and confounding variables.
- In the second column, describe what you could change to minimize each threat.}

Finally, students share their results. With their partners, students will create a presentation (poster, slide deck, etc) that outlines:

- the research question

- the faulty research plan (including a discussion of each threat

- an analysis of the validity of the conclusions

- a discussion of how to minimize threats

=== Synthesize

* Along the way, encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. If there's time, consider having students use @handout{rubric-threats-to-validity.adoc} for peer review.

* Finally, celebrate students' work! In many instances, students will want to share their project, given how much time they have invested. Class or public presentations can instill a sense of pride. (In this case, you can even invite students to wear their "bad data scientist" costumes!)
