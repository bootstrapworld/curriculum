| Selection bias
| The research plan lays out clearly and specifically how information will be gathered from a non-representative sample of the population.
| The research plan lays out how information will be gathered from a non-representative sample of the population, but is lacking in detail and specificity.
| The research plan does not address how information will be gathered from a non-representative sample of the population.


| Bias in the study design
| The study is clearly biased, with “loaded” questions that lead to misrepresentation of true opinions.
| The study includes some bias, but it is unclear how the plan will lead to misrepresentation of true opinions.
| The study design does not include bias.



| Poor choice of summary data
| The research plan includes extreme outliers that will shift the results of the analysis in ways that do not represent the population as a whole.
| The research plan includes some outliers, but they are perhaps not adequately extreme to shift the results and misrepresent the population.
| The research plan does not include extreme outliers.


| Confounding variables
| The study overlooks factors that clearly influence a relationship, leading to invalid claims.
| The study overlooks factors that might influence a relationship, perhaps leading to invalid claims.
| The study does not include any confounding variables.


| Discuss Conclusions
| The concluding discussion clearly articulates how all of the threats to validity cause problems to the study’s conclusions. 
| The concluding discussion only articulates how some of the threats caused problems or is lacking in detail and evidence / analysis. 
| The concluding discussion is lacking in detail and evidence. Understanding of how threats to validity influence a study is not demonstrated. 

| Good Data Scientists would...
| Clear explanations are provided of what changes could be made to minimize the threats.
| Some explanation is provided of what changes could be made to minimize threats, but more details are needed.
| Understanding of how to revise the study to minimize threats is not demonstrated.
