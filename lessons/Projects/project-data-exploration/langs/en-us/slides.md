# Dataset Exploration Project

The official launch of this project took place during @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset}. There are four project-related items that you accomplished during the lesson:

1. You selected a dataset of interest.
2. You copied, saved, and explored the @starter-file{exploration-project} template.
3. You completed the "About My Dataset" section of the slide deck.
4. You added a bar chart and a pie chart to the "Making Displays" section of the slide deck, and then interpreted them.

<!--
_Note: Students add their bar and pie charts during @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset} rather than during the @lesson-link{bar-and-pie-charts}, which comes before they'll have chosen a dataset. For all other displays, students will add to their slide deck during the relevant lesson._

As we continue to work on this project, you will want to refer to @handout{exploration-paper-rubric.adoc, "page 1"} and @handout{exploration-paper-rubric-2.adoc, "page 2"} of the rubric.

This will help you to understand the scope of the project at the outset. 

<!--
Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the rubric for their unique classroom context. For instance, some teachers will assess the entire project at its close, while some will offer intermittent checkpoints.

There are eight lessons when we will apply what we have learned to one particular dataset. The lessons are:

- Histograms
- Visualizing the "Shape of Data"
- Measures of Center
- Box Plots
- Standard Deviation
- Scatter Plots
- Correlations
- Linear Regression

When it's time to work on the _Data Exploration Project_, you will need on hand:

- Your copy of the starter file for the dataset they chose from our @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.adoc, "Library of Datasets"} 

- Your copy of the @starter-file{exploration-project}

<!--
_When working on their Data Exploration Project, encourage students to create *multiple* displays._ 

This project - as its name suggests - is all about _exploration_.

At the end of the project, you will have time to customize your slides, add graphics, and beautify your slide decks.

<!--
* @optional For teachers who have additional time available or students who are interested, the @lesson-link{project-research-paper} is a challenging extension, where students investigate the questions they've developed through their _Data Exploration Project_ and use their data to tell a story.
