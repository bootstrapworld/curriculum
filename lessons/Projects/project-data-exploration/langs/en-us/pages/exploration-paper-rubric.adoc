| About this Dataset
| I explained why this dataset is interesting to me, others like me, and why others should care about this data. I considered why the dataset was collected, and what purpose it might serve. I correctly identified all the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.
| I explained why this dataset was interesting to me and at least one other person/group, and shared _something_ about where it came from. I correctly identified most of the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.

| Bar and Pie Charts
| I added at two or more bar charts to my slide deck. I added two or more pie charts to my slide deck. For each display, I indicated which columns I used and added the relevant code. If the display is useful or interesting, I have made a strong attempt to interpret it. When interesting questions emerged, I added them to the "My Questions" section of my slide deck.
| I added one bar chart and one pie chart to my slide deck. For each display, I provided the column name and relevant code. When displays were useful or interesting, I attempted to interpret them, but my interpretations need more details. When interesting questions emerged, I added them to the "My Questions" section of my slide deck.
| I included one display or no displays in my slide deck. (I forgot either the bar chart, the pie chart--or both.) My slides do not include a correct column name or code. I either failed to interpret my data, or did so inaccurately.

| Histograms
| I made at least one type of each display, with descriptive and accurate titles. I included all of the code and columns I used, along with a detailed interpretation of what the display might mean.
| I made at least one type of each display, with titles. I included the columns and code I used, and tried to explain what the display tells me.
| I made some of the displays and titles. For the ones I made, I included the columns and code I used. I tried to explain some of the displays.

| Measures of Center
| I selected at least two columns in my dataset, and correctly filled out the entire summary table for each one. Based on these measures, I was able to pick which measure of center was best for each column, and I provided a detailed interpretation of what these measures tell me about the dataset.
| I selected at least two columns in my dataset, and correctly filled out the entire summary table for each one. I tried to interpret what these measures tell me about the dataset.
| I selected two columns in my dataset, and filled out most of the table. My interpretation was mostly restating the numbers from the table.

| My Questions
| I had lots of questions by the end of the exploration, and I chose at least two that I thought were most interesting. I explained why I thought they were interesting, and wrote about grouped samples that might be good to explore when answering those questions.
