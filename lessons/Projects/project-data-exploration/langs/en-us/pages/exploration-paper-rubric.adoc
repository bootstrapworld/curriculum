| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| I included two or more displays of this type. I indicated which column(s) I used and @ifproglang{pyret}{added the relevant code}@ifproglang{codap}{described how I made it}. I made a strong attempt to interpret the interesting and/or useful displays. I added the questions that emerged to the "My Questions" section.
| I included one display of this type. I provided the column name @ifproglang{pyret}{and relevant code}@ifproglang{codap}{and a description of how I made it}. My interpretation lacked detail. When interesting questions emerged, I added them to the "My Questions" section.
| I included one or no displays of this type. My slides do not include a correct column name or @ifproglang{pyret}{code}@ifproglang{codap}{description of how I made the display}. I either failed to interpret my data, or did so inaccurately.
