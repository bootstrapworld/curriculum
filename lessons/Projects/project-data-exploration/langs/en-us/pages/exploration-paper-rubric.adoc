| I added two or more of the specified display to my slide deck. For each display, I indicated which column(s) I used and @ifproglang{pyret}{added the relevant code}@ifproglang{codap}{described how I made it}. If the display was useful or interesting, I made a strong attempt to interpret it. When interesting questions emerged, I added them to the "My Questions" section of my slide deck.
| I added one of the specified display to my slide deck. For the display, I provided the column name @ifproglang{pyret}{and relevant code}@ifproglang{codap}{and a description of how I made it}. When displays were useful or interesting, I attempted to interpret them, but my interpretations lacked detail. When interesting questions emerged, I added them to the "My Questions" section of my slide deck.
| I included one display or no displays in my slide deck. My slides do not include a correct column name or @ifproglang{pyret}{code}@ifproglang{codap}{description of how I made the display}. I either failed to interpret my data, or did so inaccurately.
