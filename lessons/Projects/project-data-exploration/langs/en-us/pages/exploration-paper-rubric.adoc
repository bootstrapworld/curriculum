| About this Dataset
| I explained why this dataset is interesting to me, others like me, and why others should care about this data. I considered why the dataset was collected, and what purpose it might serve. I correctly identified all the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.
| I explained why this dataset was interesting to me and at least one other person/group, and shared _something_ about where it came from. I correctly identified most of the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.

| Making Displays
| I made at least one type of each display, with descriptive and accurate titles. I included all of the code and columns I used, along with a detailed interpretation of what the display might mean.

| Measures of Center and Spread
| I selected at least two columns in my dataset, and correctly filled out the entire summary table for each one. Based on these measures, I was able to pick which measure of center was best for each column, and I provided a detailed interpretation of what these measures tell me about the dataset.

| I selected two columns in my dataset, and filled out most of the table. My interpretation was mostly restating the numbers from the table.

| Looking towards the Research Paper
| I had lots of questions by the end of the exploration, and I chose at least two that I thought were most interesting. I explained why I thought they were interesting, and wrote about grouped samples that might be good to explore when answering those questions.
