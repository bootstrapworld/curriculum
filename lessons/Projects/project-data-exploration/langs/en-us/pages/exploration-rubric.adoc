| &#9744; Wow!

| &#9744; Needs Improvement

| I either included multiple visualizations of this type or wrote about why I my data didn't allow for multiple. I indicated which column(s) I used and @ifproglang{pyret}{added the relevant code}@ifproglang{codap}{described how I made it}. I made a strong attempt to interpret the interesting visualizations and report about the visualizations that weren't useful. I added the questions that emerged to the "My Questions" section.
| I included one display of this type. I provided the column name @ifproglang{pyret}{and relevant code}@ifproglang{codap}{and a description of how I made it}. My interpretation lacked detail. I added the questions that emerged to the "My Questions" section.
| I included one or no visualizations of this type. My slides may be missing a correct column name or @ifproglang{pyret}{code}@ifproglang{codap}{description of how I made the display}. My data interpretation may be missing or inaccurate. I may not have added to the "My Questions" section.
