| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* create a variety of displays about a dataset of their choosing
* compute a the measures of center and spread about a dataset of their choosing

| Student-facing Lesson Goals

* Let's explore and interpret a dataset that we find intriguing.

| Preparation

* This project spans multiple lessons in the data science curriculum.
* Before introducing students to this project, we recommend that you review and revise the template to meet the needs of your students. We've included a vast array of displays and measures of center; you don't need to use all of them!

== Dataset Exploration Project  @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

In this multi-lesson capstone project, students explore and interpret a chosen dataset. First, they reflect on the dataset's source, structure, and relevance. Then, they create and interpret a range of categorical and quantitative displays. They also compute and analyze various measures of spread and center. This work culminates in students developing a research question for possible further study.

=== Launch

The official launch of this project occurs during @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset}. There are four project-related items to accomplish during this lesson:

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Students select a dataset of interest from the Bootstrap @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.adoc, "List of Datasets"}.

- Students copy, save, and explore the @starter-file{exploration-project} template.
** _Invite them to peruse the slide deck and familiarize themselves it; they'll be revisiting and adding to it often._

- Students complete the "About My Dataset" section of the slide deck.

- Students add a bar chart and a pie chart to the "Making Displays" section of the slide deck, and then interpret them.
--

_Note: Students add their bar and pie charts during @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset} rather than during the @lesson-link{bar-and-pie-charts}. For all other displays, students will add to their slide deck during the relevant lesson._

We recommend printing and distributing the student-facing @opt-printable-exercise{exploration-paper-rubric.adoc} to help students understand the scope of the project and your expectations at the outset. Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the rubric for their unique classroom context.

=== Investigate

We've titled the closing section of *eight* different data science lessons _Dataset Exploration Project_. This title is an indication that it is time for students to revisit their chosen dataset and apply what they have learned in that particular lesson.

[.lesson-instruction]
The eight lessons include: @lesson-link{histograms} - @lesson-link{visualizing-the-shape-of-data} - @lesson-link{measures-of-center} - @lesson-link{box-plots} - @lesson-link{standard-deviation} - @lesson-link{scatter-plots} - @lesson-link{correlations} - @lesson-link{linear-regression}

For these lesson sections, students will always need on hand (1) the starter file for their chosen dataset and (2) the slide deck template.

_When working on their Dataset Exploration Project, encourage students to create *multiple* displays._ This project - as its name suggests - is all about _exploration_. For teachers who have additional time available or students who are interested, the @lesson-link{project-research-paper} is a challenging extension, where students investigate a single question and use their data to tell a story.

=== Synthesize

Invite students to customize their slides, add graphics, and beautify their slide decks.

Encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. Peer review is a powerful tool if time allows! The @opt-printable-exercise{exploration-paper-rubric.adoc} is a useful resource for facilitating both self and peer review.

Finally, celebrate students' work! In many instances, students will want to share their project, given how much time they have invested. Class or public presentations can instill a sense of pride.

@optional Use the questions students have developed as the jumping-off point for @lesson-link{project-research-paper}!
