= Project: Make an Infographic

@description{Infographics are a powerful tool for communicating information, especially when made by people who understand how to connect visuals to data in meaningful ways. This project is an opportunity for students to become more flexible math thinkers while tapping into their creativity.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* think critically and creatively about ratio relationships
* represent ratio relationships using either repeated images, scaled images, or area models

| Student-facing Lesson Goals

* Let's make an infographic on a topic of interest!

| Preparation
|
* Think about what data will be the basis of your students' infographics. We offer four different options in the "Investigate" section of this lesson. Some require teacher preparation.
* Students may create their final product with construction paper, markers and art supplies - or using a slide deck / word processor. It's up to you.
* This project is designed to span multiple days. Consider what work you want students to complete at home and at school.

== Make an Infographic @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students get curious about a variety of provided infographics, then complete research and plan to create their own - either electronically, or with paper and art supplies.

=== Launch

A good *infographic* is worth a thousand words!

Infographics are graphic visual representations of data, information, or knowledge that present information quickly and clearly. You probably see infographics all around you - in advertisements, political campaigns, your textbooks, on the news... they're everywhere, because they are so impactful.

@teacher{Explain to students that they are going to create their own infographics. To launch the project, they will look at and consider a variety of infographics, such as the one on the right created by Mona Chalabi. As you peruse the infographics in the @online-exercise{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14D98yI7XPzZ-e8PDJrP0iXrvVNxhsFjm_m-1goKSRuw/edit?usp=sharing, "Sample Infographics"} slide deck together, discuss as a class what students observe.

Before you dive in, we recommend printing and distributing the student-facing @handout{rubric-infographic.adoc} to help students understand the scope of the project and your expectations at the outset. Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the rubric for their unique classroom context.

As you move through the slide deck, discuss the questions below.}

[.lesson-instruction]
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
- Are the words on the infographic clear and impactful? Why or why not?
- Are the images in the infographic impactful? Why or why not?
- Is the infographic accurate (e.g., every element is in the same proportion)?
- Why do you think each author chose to use a certain strategy to represent their ratio statement (e.g., illustrate ratios using repeated images)?

Emphasize to students that a tricky thing about making infographics with images of people is that not all images accurately represent the diversity of the communities described by the statistics. We encourage the use of silhouetted images in infographics.

=== Investigate

For the remainder of the project that, students will (1) do some research (with varying levels of teacher support, depending on age and ability), (2) write a ratio statement or create a display, and (3) make the actual infographic.

First, students must select and consider the information that will form the basis of their infographics. Below, we offer a number of options for data that might be the basis of your students' infographics.

- *Option 1:* Students can build bar or pie charts in Pyret from the @starter-file{food} or any of the @link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.html, data sets in our library}. _This option is appropriate for students who are comfortable independently building and interpreting displays._

- *Option 2:* Students may find a pie or bar chart on the internet about a topic of interest to use as a starting point. _This option works best for students who can confidently conduct an internet search and discern which internet sources are reliable._

- *Option 3:* Students build a pie or bar chart in google sheets based on a summary statistic that they find about an issue that is of interest. _For this option, students need to be able to recognize reliable internet sources. Option 3 is also valuable if there is a school-wide interest in students developing comfort with google sheets._

- *Option 4:* _This option is the most appropriate for younger students, who need more teacher support._ As a class, agree on a topic of interest, and then generate as many quantitative questions as possible about that topic. (E.g., if the topic is veterans, students might ask: What's the gender breakdown? Do veterans have higher suicide rates? What percentage of veterans struggle with mental health?) Then, spend some time locating data that answers each question to develop a list of ratio statements for students to choose from. Students will use that statement in making a bar or pie chart and a corresponding infographic.

Some teachers prefer that all students work from the same dataset while others encourage students to pursue their own unique interests. It is up to you how much freedom or structure you offer your students during this phase.

Once students have conducted their research, it is time to write a ratio statement (for options 1-3) or create a bar/pie chart (for option 4). Urge students to refer to their rubrics for guidance on doing this well!

Some teachers have students submit their work up to this point to monitor progress and ensure that all students have a solid foundation for the remainder of the project. Others opt to conduct a peer review using the @handout{rubric-infographic.adoc}.

As students write their ratio statements and work on their infographics, one important point to emphasize is that all percentages are ratios! 40% is equivalent to 40 out of 100. If 40% of students wear baseball hats we can show 100 people, of which 40 are wearing hats. Or we could scale 40/100 down to 2/5 and show 5 people of which 2 are wearing hats.

At this point, students should be ready to independently complete their projects. You may choose to allot class time (when students could use computers or art supplies), or you can direct students to complete the remainder of their infographics at home.


=== Synthesize

* Once finished, encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. Peer review is built into the lesson, but you might also have students use the @handout{rubric-infographic.adoc} to facilitate further self and peer review.

* Finally, celebrate students' work! In many instances, students will want to share their project, given how much time they have invested. Class or public presentations can instill a sense of pride.
