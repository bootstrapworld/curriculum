| &#9744; Wow!
| &#9744; Getting There
| &#9744; Needs Improvement

| Preparatory Work
| The display or ratio statement formed a strong foundation for the rest of my infographic project.
| The display or ratio statement needed revision in order to inspire a meaningful infographic (e.g., it was unclear or it was not interesting).
| I did not create a display or ratio statement or what I produced was not conducive to creating a meaningful infographic.

| Ratio statement: Impact
| My ratio statement will really give those who read it something fascinating to contemplate!
| My ratio statement is interesting but probably wonâ€™t spark any deep conversations.
| My ratio statement is dull and uninspired.

| Images chosen: Accessibility
| The imagery that I used when creating my infographic is inclusive. My images avoid stereotyping and help the viewer relate to and understand the topic.
| The imagery that I used mostly avoids stereotyping. More inclusive imagery might help viewers connect with my topic better.
| The imagery that I included reinforces stereotypes and might leave some viewers feeling disconnected from my message.

| Infographic: Accuracy
| The infographic is correctly drawn to scale (every element is in the same proportion).
| There were some minor errors made in drawing the infographic to scale.
| The infographic is not accurately scaled.

| Infographic: Impact
| The strategy that I chose (repeated images / bars on a grid / area model) makes sense for my ratio statement and has a strong impact.
| The strategy that I chose makes sense but is not terribly impactful; another strategy might have been more effective at conveying my ratio statement.
| The strategy that I chose did not make sense in this context nor did it have an impact.
