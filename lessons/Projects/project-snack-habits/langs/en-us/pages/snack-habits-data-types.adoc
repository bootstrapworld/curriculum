*Note:* Most snacks come in packages with nutritional value labels that will help you to answer many of these questions. When eating a snack whose package does not include the nutritional value, a simple google search will return an image that looks just like those labels, e.g. "Nutritional Value of an Apple". Similarly, if you get a snack from the cupboard rather than the store, you can google for the price.
