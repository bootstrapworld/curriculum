| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

- develop interesting statistical research questions 
- analyze class data, using Pyret displays to support their analysis
- search for relevant graphs on the internet to use as points of comparison

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

- Let's collect data, create a collective spreadsheet, and understand what it means to “clean” a spreadsheet.  
- Let's develop statistical research questions to investigate.
- Let's analyze our class data, using Pyret to create displays that will support our analysis.  
- Let's compare our snacking habits to the class and to the U.S. population to find out how they are similar and different.

@preparation{
- Make a copy of @link{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PklP5FhpsWlUrQU6UaV0OKYxzq_Pz5YheLoiGs3yTeM/copy, this Google form} and decide how best to share the link with your students so that all of their responses will end up in the class' collective spreadsheet. 
- None of the handouts for this project are in the workbook, so be sure to print copies of whatever you'll be distributing.
- Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the student-facing @handout{rubric-snack-habits.adoc} for their unique classroom context and distribute it to help students understand the scope of the project - and your expectations - at the outset.
}

| Facilitation Note
| 

- This project involves 5 days of data collection about the snacks and non-water beverages students consume between meals before students can do any analysis in Pyret. It is most efficient to introduce the project midweek so that two of the data collection days fall on the weekend!_In a full-year, 5x/week class with no homework, for example, students could:_ 
   * Thursday: start collecting data
   * Friday: look at the spreadsheet as a class
   * Monday: during class, students conduct internet research in search of statistics and displays about snack habits in the U.S.
   * Tuesday: with your class dataset complete, students can use class time to build categorical displays from your class data in Pyret and complete the project by the end of the week
- This project scratches the surface of what it means to clean data. If you find yourself wanting to dig deeper into that, we offer an entire Bootstrap lesson on @lesson-link{data-collection} that could be taught during this project.
- Some veteran Bootstrap teachers opt to have their students push beyond the scope of this project in the following ways:
  * Building displays for Quantitative Columns using @ifproglang{pyret}{their @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Page} and }@dist-link{pages/2-blank-data-cycles.adoc, Blank Data Cycle Pages}
  * Building displays for their own personal data from a filtered table made 
  @ifproglang{codap}{with teacher support} 
  @ifproglang{pyret}{with a teacher-provided filter function}

| Project Origins
| 

- This project was developed based on a project named *Food Habits* from the @link{http://introdatascience.org/, Mobilizing IDS project}.

== Building a Data Set: Our Snacking Habits @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students track their snacking habits over the course of 5 days to generate a collective data set. In preparation, they'll identify the data types of each variable. By revisiting the spreadsheet the class is generating throughout the data collection phase, you'll have an opportunity to discuss what it means to clean a data set.

@teacher{Note: This phase of the project should be started right away, but does not need to be completed before moving on to the Researching U.S. Snacking Habits phase of this project.}

=== Launch

As a result of advocacy, food packaging is required to provide consumers with nutritional information so we can make informed choices.  

We're going to track our snacking habits for 5 days to generate a collective dataset that we can analyze. For our purposes we will define a snack as any food or beverage other than water that you consume between meals. For each snack that you consume over the next 5 days you will be reading the Nutrition Facts on the labels (or googling for them) in order to enter a number of data points into a google form.

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's turn to @handout{snack-habits-data-types.adoc} and take a look at the kinds of data we'll be collecting.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? Record your thoughts (Q1).
- With your partner complete the third column of the table by deciding what data type each variable will be.
}

Confirm that students have correctly identified the data types.

@teacher{
Make sure you've made a copy of @link{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PklP5FhpsWlUrQU6UaV0OKYxzq_Pz5YheLoiGs3yTeM/copy, this Google form} and shared a link with your students.
}

@lesson-instruction{ 
- Your task is to complete the google form for every snack you eat over the next 5 days. 
- Please save the link I shared with you somewhere that will be easy for you to find. (In "Notes" on your phone? In a text message? In an email?)
- If you eat a snack when you don't have time to fill out the form, please take a picture of it and/or make a note to help you fill out the form later on.
- We will be looking at the spreadsheet together in our next class to see how our dataset is shaping up.
}

@teacher{You may want to have students complete @handout{snack-habits-check-in.adoc} part way through the data collection process.}

=== Investigate

@teacher{
To access your class' data:

- *Link the Google Form Responses to a Google Sheet* from the Responses of the form by clicking the button that reads *Link to Sheet*. The sheet will automatically continue to populate the Google Sheet each time the form gets submitted.

- When your class is done collecting data, 
  * duplicate the sheet in a new tab 
  * name the new tab "cleaned" 
  * remove the timestamp column and the image column
  * make sure the sharing settings are set to "Anyone with the link can view"
@ifproglang{pyret}{
  * copy the url into the @starter-file{snack} to import the data, publish the file and share a link with your students
}
@ifproglang{codap}{
  * import the spreadsheet into CODAP and share a link with your students
}

We have set the form up with data verification for most questions to minimize the amount of cleaning you will have to do, but we would expect that the one word answers to "Why are you eating this snack?" will require some attention to address: 

- typos
- inconsistent capitalization
- words that mean the same thing as each other and should be combined 
- perhaps there are a number of nonsense words that might make more sense to be replaced by "idk" why I'm snacking?

If you have the time, we encourage you to project the spreadsheet and tackle cleaning the data with your students, asking:

- What inconsistencies do you see in the data?
- How should we address them?

Ideally, by the time you're done you could make a pie-chart of the "why" column and the breakdown of reasons would be informative. 
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Now that we have finished collecting our data, let's see what we can learn about our habits!
- Open the starter file I shared with you and use it to complete @handout{data-cycle-categorical.adoc}
}

For reference, here's an example of a display from one Bootstrap teacher's class. Consider the kinds of discussions your class might have if the data from your class came back looking like this.

=== Synthesize

- What did you learn as you interpreted the distribution of categorical columns?
- What new questions do you have?

== Research: U.S. Snacking Habits Data

=== Overview

Students will gather information from studies about U.S. snacking habits and compare them to the data we've just gathered as a class.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
Do you think the sample we've made of our snack habits is representative of snacking in the United States?
}

We don't have to guess! There's plenty of research out there for us to look at. In fact, enough data has been collected about childhood obesity in the United States that soda machines and unhealthy snacks have been pulled from many schools.

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your favorite search engine (Google, Brave, DuckDuckGo, etc.) and type +
"What do Americans eat for snacks?”
- Look for graphs and statistics that relate to the kinds of data we're collecting about our own snacking habits.
}

=== Synthesize

Compare and contrast your findings from our class data and the research you've been doing about U.S. Data. 

@scrub{Make a similar and different handout}

== Analysis: A Statistical Question of Your Own

=== Overview

Building on their explorations of the class data and initial research about U.S. Snacking habits, students develop a statistical question to present their findings on.

=== Launch

Now that you've had some time to explore both our class data and the research that's been done about snacking habits in the U.S., it's time to identify a statistical question that is of particular interest to you and present your findings.

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Make your own copy of @link{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nnPpgCQDYknyxTzc_dvs34R2szxS3izz2Ya5gpAKDtE/copy, this slide template}.
- Edit each slide to share your thinking and findings. 
Add more slides if you need!  
}

=== Synthesize

- What were the pros and cons of working with data generated by you and your classmates?
- What other data do you wish had been part of our collective data set? What other questions would you suggest adding to the form?

@teacher{
- Once finished, encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. 
- Decide what form of sharing their projects works best for you. 
  * Class presentations can instill a sense of pride. 
  * Presenting in small groups can take less time. 
  * You may also want to have them print some part of their presentation to display on a bulletin board.
- Did your students have brilliant suggestions for how we could improve the form for future classes? Please share your ideas with @link{contact@bootstrapworld.org}!
