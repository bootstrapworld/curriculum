= Project: Build a Video Game

@description{Students build a video game of their own design! Every game must have a player (their avatar), a danger (something to avoid), and a target (something to chase). Students build their world using function composition, animate their characters through linear functions, detect boundaries with compound inequalities, and detect collisions with the distance formula.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* recognize meaningful applications of multiple algebraic concepts.
* express their creativity through the design of a game context.
* share their completed video game with friends and family to play.

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's create a video game!

| Preparation
|
* Following the default lesson order for Bootstrap:Algebra (e.g., teaching every lesson) will result in students building video games! That said, some teachers prefer to save all _game-focused lessons_ for the end of the year, allowing students to create games in 1-2 weeks.
* Decide if you want to teach concepts first - and culminate with students creating their games... or take an integrated approach, where students gradually add to their games over a longer period of time. It is up to you!

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Students add to their game's code during a variety of lessons in Bootstrap:Algebra.
* This project can be extended! Students can add their own "cheat codes" (piecewise/conditional functions). They can also add more complex movement (using quadratic, exponential, and trigonometric functions).

== Build Your Own Video Game  @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

This project can be used as the capstone for Bootstrap:Algebra. It is designed to provide real-world and engaging connections to the following mathematical concepts: Coordinates; Simple and Compound Inequalities; Domain and Range; Composing Functions; Connecting Representations and Defining Functions;
Rotation, Dilation, and Translation; the Distance Formula and Pythagorean Theorem; Piecewise Functions.

=== Launch

There are five phases of video game creation: (1)
Designing the Game; (2) Creating Game Images; (3)
Making Characters Move; (4) Defining Boundaries; (5) Animating the Player; and (6) Detecting Collisions.

Each phase (except the first one) requires that you teach:

- up to four lessons during which students learn relevant coding skills and concepts
- one lesson where students use newly acquired skills to update the code of their @starter-file{game} to eventually make their video game playable.

In our Bootstrap:Algebra curriculum, there are _many_ more lessons where students can develop their math and coding skills. _The lessons outlined below are the ones considered essential for video game creation._

*Designing the Game* is the only phase of game creation where students do not learn new programming skills, nor do they edit their @starter-file{game}.

| @lesson-link{numbers-inside-video-games}
| In this optional lesson, students identify objects in a video game that change. They consider the time, money, and resources it takes to create a popular video game.

| @lesson-link{coordinates}
| Students create a sample mock-up (proof of concept) of their games.

@vspace{1ex}

During the *Creating Game Images* phase, students learn core the most fundamental coding basics, then update Section 0 of their @starter-file{game}.

|===

| @lesson-link{order-of-operations}
| Students model arithmetic expressions visually with Circles of Evaluation, and then translate those Circles of Evaluation into code.

| @lesson-link{simple-data-types}
| Students identify what makes each of three data types (Numbers, Strings, and Booleans) unique.

| @lesson-link{contracts}
| Students learn to interpret the information contained in Contracts: Name, Domain, and Range.

| @lesson-link{defining-values}
| Students learn to improve readability, performance and maintanability of code by defining values that repeat in code, just as we would define variables in math.

| @lesson-link{making-game-images}
| Students choose, import, scale and orient images for their game, practicing reading comments to make sense of and begin to edit a large body of code.

=== Investigate

@teacher{We recommend printing and distributing the student-facing rubric to help students understand the scope of the project and your expectations at the outset.

The next set of lesson instructions involves a walk-through of the slide deck template, with periodic discussion the relevant rubric rows. Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the rubric for their unique classroom context.}


=== Synthesize

* Invite students to customize their slides, add graphics, and beautify their slide decks.

* Encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. Peer review is a powerful tool if time allows!

* Finally, celebrate students' work! In many instances, students will want to share their project, given how much time they have invested. Class or public presentations can instill a sense of pride.
