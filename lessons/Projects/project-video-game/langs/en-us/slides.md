# Build a Video Game

You're going to make a video game! There are six phases of video game creation, which will happen over time.

0. Brainstorming
1. Game Imagery
2. Character Movement
3. Boundaries
4. Player Movement
5. Collisions


@teacher{
This slide deck is brief! See the associated lesson for more details. If you are interested in hooking student interest, we recommend teaching our Coordinates lesson. Each phase of game creation (except for the first and the last) requires that you teach:

- up to four prerequisite lessons during which students learn relevant coding skills and algebra concepts
- one lesson where students use what they've learned to update the code of their @starter-file{game, "Game Starter File"}.}

Be sure to check out the @handout{video-game-rubric.adoc} to understand expectations for the game!

The rubric can be a valuable tool for self-assessment while we are constructing the game and also once you are finished!
