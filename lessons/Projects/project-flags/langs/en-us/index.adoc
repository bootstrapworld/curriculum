| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...


* express a piece of their identity by creating a flag of personal importance or interest
* create a coded image of a flag by applying their knowledge of ratios, the coordinate plane, and function composition

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's program the computer to generate flags from around the world!

| Materials
|[.materials-links]

@material-links

| Preparation
|
* We recommend offering students the tactile experience of creating flags by layering pieces of construction paper. If you opt to include this activity, you will need construction paper, scissors, and glue for your stuents.
* Note that for this project, students submit: (1) Decomposing Flags, (2) Decomposing My Flag, and (3) a link to my @proglang file. It is up to you whether you collect student work all at once (at the end of the project) or intermittently, after each worksheet has been completed.


| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Before launching this project, ensure that students are comfortable using image-producing functions, `put-image`, and function composition. Student knowledge of ratios and the coordinate plane is also necessary.
* The `put-image` function treats the second image as the first quadrant of a cartesian plane. Having students sketch their flag on a sheet of graph paper drives this point home, and makes the programming easier.
* This is an excellent opportunity to introduce students to __indenting code__. The readability difference between poorly-indented flag code and well-indented flag code is dramatic.
* This project is designed to span multiple days.

== Making Flags @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students select a flag that they will recreate via code. They learn about decomposing flags before writing the code that will produce an image of their chosen flag in @proglang.

=== Launch

During Putting Images Together lesson, we
worked together to create some different flags. For this project, you will build a flag of your own - one that is important to you - and you'll use what you know about value definitions and function compositions to build it.

@slidebreak

The first step is to determine which flag you are going to create.

@QandA{
@Q{Let's brainstorm. *What are some different flags that you connect with in some way?*}
@Q{Think about places you've visited, a country you're interested in or connected to, or even a group you identify with or support.}}

@teacher{Invite students to share out - either with the class or with a partner - emphasizing that this is simply a time to share ideas and excitement! You will find that the opportunity to focus on a flag of their choosing is a big motivator for students. Coding flags also presents a rare opportunity for students to share a piece of their identity in math class.

Be mindful of the fact that not every student will know their family’s geographical history, and that immigration can be a sensitive topic for some students. For this reason, it is important that students have the option to choose a flag based on interest instead of just family history.

Note that students might choose flags representing groups other than countries. Indigenous students might choose a flag that represents their indigenous nation or the American Indian Movement. Students might also choose to focus on the pride flag (representing solidarity amongst members of the LGBTQ+ community) or an ethnic flag (representing solidarity amongst members of different ethnic groups, such as the Hispanic flag). There are also some flags that represent political or activist groups. It is important for the teacher to be open to different beliefs and ideologies, but it is also up to the teacher’s discretion as to whether or not a flag is appropriate for use in this project. Flags associated with hate groups, or any institution that denies the dignity of other students, are not appropriate.}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- In the first section of @printable-exercise{choosing-flags.adoc}, write down some ideas of flags you are interested in. Don't worry - you don't need to commit to any particular flag yet.
- Once you've brainstormed your flags and explained why you are interested in them, you will conduct an internet search to locate images of your flag.
- Reflect on each flag (its design, colors, shapes, etc) and respond the remaining questions on the page.}


@teacher{@printable-exercise{choosing-flags.adoc} is designed to support students in choosing a flag. Encourage students to choose an appropriately challenging flag that will demonstrate what they've learned. You may introduce parameters if necessary, such as “Flags need at least 5 different shapes”.
}


=== Investigate

@teacher{Now that you've selected your flags, it is time to start _decomposing._ @printable-exercise{decomposing-flags.adoc} includes four different flags. We urge you to complete at least one flag as a class. This process will involve three steps: (1) Decompose the flag, (2) consider the flag's parts (including color, width, and height), (3) determine the x and y coordinates for each part.

We recommend printing and distributing the student-facing @handout{rubric-flags.adoc} to help students understand the scope of the project and your expectations at the outset. Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the rubric for their unique classroom context. Many teachers opt to collect @printable-exercise{decomposing-flags.adoc} and grade it as a component of the project.

For this activity, you will want to project the color version of @printable-exercise{decomposing-flags.adoc}. Otherwise, students with black-and-white photocopies will be unable to identify the colors on the the flags.

Note that flags on @printable-exercise{decomposing-flags.adoc} are listed with their width:length @vocab{ratios} in the opposite order of how we define the sides of a flag in code. e.g. 2:3 could be scaled up to a 300 x 200 flag or 8:11 could be scaled up to 330 by 240.

- Let's complete Cameroon's flag together.}

@teacher{Guide students through this process. Here are some tips:

- We strongly recommend that either you or your students *build the flag with construction paper*. The act of physically building the flag from layers of paper makes the layering of the coded images visible and helps students to remember that white space is not just "blank".

- *Identifying coordinates is much easier when students have graph paper handy!* To streamline this process and improve accuracy, encourage students to use fractions for widths and heights.

- Confirm that all students have accurately decomposed the flag before inviting students to work in @proglang.}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
Referring to an image of your chosen flag, complete @printable-exercise{decomposing-my-flag.adoc}.}

@teacher{Coding flags will be a smoother process if students have accurately composed their flags with paper and pencil! Some teachers like to check student work before coding of flags begins. Others invite students to participate in peer review.}


@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
Build the image in the @starter-file{flags} and check that it matches the target image.}

This will involve defining flag parts, then stacking those parts on top of the bottom image using the coordinates we found.

@slidebreak

Some suggestions for elegant and accurate code:

- Don't cram everything into one line! If you break code up into new lines (for example, hitting "Return" before the x-coordinate and after the y-coordinate), you'll notice that the code forms a "staircase" pattern.

- Consider defining `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` of their flags as values - and then __replace the numbers in each flag__ with expressions relative to width and height. For example, if the `dot` in the Japanese flag is at (150, 100), those numbers would be replaced with @show{(code '(/ WIDTH 2))} and @show{(code '(/ HEIGHT 2))}.

- Be sure to compare the image you get with the target image!


@strategy{Additional Practice to Support Students}{


For students who need additional support and practice before diving into building their own flags, we offer a variety of resources. Many teachers complete additional flags from @printable-exercise{decomposing-flags.adoc} as a class. @ifproglang{pyret}{
Additionally, these matching activities further support student thinking.

=== Synthesize

* Encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. Peer review is a powerful tool if time allows! The @handout{rubric-flags.adoc, "rubric"} is a useful resource for facilitating both self and peer review.

* Finally, celebrate students' work! In many instances, students will want to share their project, given how much time they have invested. Class or public presentations can instill a sense of pride. Consider hosting a tour of flags of the world in your classroom.
