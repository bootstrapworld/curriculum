| Preparation
|
* Before launching this project, ensure that students are comfortable using image-producing functions, `put-image`, and function composition.
* Student knowledge of ratios and the coordinate plane is also necessary.
* Note that for this project, students must submit four different components: (1) Sample Logo Study, (2) Designing Your Logo, (3) Coding Your Logo, and (4) the link to their published Pyret program. It is up to you whether you collect student work all at once (at the end of the project) or intermittently, after each worksheet has been completed.
* This project is designed to span multiple days.

== Making Flags @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students focus on decomposing complex images into simple ones and using `put-image` to combine images.

=== Launch
Let's dig into the process for how the flags we’ve seen so far were made:

*1) Decompose the Image*

We observe that the Japanese flag is made up of two simpler images: a black, outline rectangle and a red dot.


*2) Define those Parts*

We define `dot` and `background`. Once we’ve defined those images, we test them out in the Interactions Area to make sure they look right!


*3) Find the Coordinates*

For each image, calculate what the x- and y-coordinates of where the center should be. __TIP: this is a lot easier if you have a sheet of graph paper handy!__


*4) Build the Image & Check that it Matches the Target Image*

We stack the parts on top of the bottom image using the coordinates we found.
__TIP: don't cram all the code into one line! If you break it up into new lines (for example, hitting "Return" before the x-coordinate and after the y-coordinate), you'll notice that the code forms a "staircase" pattern.__ Be sure to compare the image you get with the target image!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{decomposing-flags.adoc}, and choose ONE flag to focus on. On the blank lines below, describe the parts that make up that flag.
** _Note: You may want to project the color version of this page; otherwise, students using black-and-white photocopies will be unable to identify the colors on the the flags._
- For a more tactile experience, construct your flag using construction paper.
** _If you have time, this is a valuable activity! The act of physically building the flag from layers of paper makes the layering of the coded images visible and helps students to remember that white space is not just "blank"._
- Once you're done, return to the @starter-file{flags} and define those parts.
- Then, compose those parts using `put-image`, and make your flag!
}

The opportunity to focus on a flag of their choosing is a big motivator for students. Coding flags also presents a rare opportunity for students to share a piece of their identity in math class. If you have more time to devote, we highly encourage you to give students the opportunity to create the image of a flag they connect with in some way.  Students might choose the flags of countries related to their heritage, a place they’ve visited, a country they’re interested in, or a group they identify with or support.

Encourage students to choose an appropriately challenging flag that will demonstrate what they've learned.  The teacher may introduce parameters if necessary, such as “Flags need at least 5 different shapes”. Once students have coded their flags, host a tour of the flags of the world in your classroom!


Note: To reinforce ratio and proportion concepts, have students define the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` of their flags as values, and then __replace the numbers in each flag__ with expressions relative to width and height. For example, if the `dot` in the Japanese flag is at (150, 100), those numbers would be replaced with @show{(code '(/ WIDTH 2))} and @show{(code '(/ HEIGHT 2))}.


@strategy{
@span{.title}{Around the World in your Classroom}

Be mindful of the fact that not every student will know their family’s geographical history, and
that immigration can be a sensitive topic for some students.  For this reason, it is important that students have the option to choose a flag based on interest instead of just family history.

Be prepared that students might choose flags representing groups other than countries.  Indigenous students might choose a flag that represents their indigenous nation or the American Indian Movement. Students might also choose to focus on the pride flag (representing solidarity amongst members of the LGBTQ+ community) or an ethnic flag (representing solidarity amongst members of different ethnic groups, such as the Hispanic flag).  There are also some flags that represent political or activist groups.  It is important for the teacher to be open to different beliefs and ideologies, but it is also up to the teacher’s discretion as to whether or not a flag is appropriate for use in this project. Flags associated with hate groups, or any institution that denies the dignity of other students, are not appropriate.

Optional: @opt-printable-exercise{pages/flags-of-the-world-resource.pdf, Flags of the World} and @opt-online-exercise{http://www.flagwizard.net/, Flag Wizard} may be useful to students looking for ideas. Flags are listed with their width:length @vocab{ratios} in the opposite order of how we define the sides of a flag in code. e.g. 2:3 could be scaled up to a 300 x 200 flag or 8:11 could be scaled up to 330 by 240.

=== Synthesize

Which flags were the easiest to make? The hardest?

Why is it useful to define each part of the flag first, before stitching the images together?

== Additional Exercises

- @opt-starter-file{flags-pr} - This starter file generates a jumbled pile of shapes. Students work to fix the code by resizing, rotating, and correctly locating the components on the background in order to compose an image that looks like the original flag.

- @opt-starter-file{flags-ak} - For a quick dive into why it’s more efficient to @vocab{define} shapes before building the image.

- @opt-starter-file{flags-lebanon} - For practice @vocab{scaling} imported graphics.

- @opt-starter-file{flags-mx} - Similar to the Puerto Rico Flag Starter File, but this one involves an imported image.

- @opt-starter-file{flags-trinidad} - If you’ve already studied Pythagorean Theorem and are ready to apply it.

- @opt-starter-file{flags-turkey} - For a fun function-composition puzzle.
