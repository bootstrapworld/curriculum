= Coding Your Logo

== Represent Your Logo with a Circle of Evaluation

@n Draw a Circle of Evaluation to show how you will compose the functions you selected (above) in order to create your logo. If you need more space, use a separate sheet of paper.

== Peer Review

@n Swap papers with a partner. Write your name on the line so that your teacher knows who is reviewing this design. @fitb{}{}

@n Did your parter put a function at the top of each Circle? If no, explain what the problem is. @fitb{}{}

@n Are all of the inputs in the correct order? If not, which contracts does your partner need to revisit to solve the problem? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Are there any syntax errors? If so, specify where. (Are all strings in quotation marks? Do all decimals have at least one number to the left of the decimal point?) @fitb{}{}

== Put Your Logo's Code in Pyret

@n Open Pyret. Log in. In the Definitions Area (left side), type `my-logo =`.

@n Translate your Circle into code and type it into the Definitions Area after the words `my-logo`. (You just defined `my-logo` to be _your logo_!)

@n Test it out. Hit "Run", then type `my-logo` into the _Interactions Area_. If you get an error, or if the logo doesn't look like the one you drew, try again until it works. Describe one adjustment that you made. @fitb{}{}

@n Add a comment to the Definitions Area describing (1) why you designed your logo the way you did, and (2) one thing you learned from completing this project.

@n Save your program. Select "File", then "Save a Copy." Go to "Publish", and copy the link that appears. Follow your teacherâ€™s instructions and submit the link via email, a web form, or your favorite LMS (Google Classroom, Schoology, etc).
