= Logo Study

@link-instructions{
We're going to look at three logos made by Bootstrap students in San Diego. Open the @starter-file{logos} and click "Run". Type `sample-logo-1` in the Interactions Area (right side) and hit enter, then repeat for the other sample logos.
}

@n Which logo's *picture* looks the most complex to you? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{students will either point to logo 1 or logo 2}}

@n Which logo's *code* looks the most complex to you? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{logo 2. In addition to having more lines of code, nearly every line of code involves a rotation.}}

@n Which logo was your favorite? @fitb{10em}{} What did you like about it? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Look at the code for the logo you chose in the previous question. List all of the _colors_ that the programmer used to create this logo. +

@n List all of the _image-producing functions_ (`triangle`, `rectangle`, etc.) that the programmer used to create this logo. +
@fitb{}{} +

@ifnotsoln{@vspace{1ex}}

@n List all of the _image-transforming functions_ (`above`, `rotate`, etc.) that the programmer used to create this logo.

@n How many layers does this logo have? (_Note: When 2 images sit beside each other, they are in the same layer._) @fitb{}{}

@n When thinking through complex code, it can be helpful to use simplified versions of Circles of Evaluation that show the structure but not the nitty gritty details of colors and sizes of shapes.

@vspace{1ex}

Make a rough sketch of a logo that would satisfy the vision represented by the Circle of Evaluation below.
@do{
(define logo3 '(overlay
(above 
(triangle (?ANS ...))
(overlay 
(rotate 90 (text "LOGO" ...))
(square (?ANS ... ))))
(ellipse (?ANS ...))))
}

@vspace{1ex}

@show{(coe logo3)}

@ifsoln{
Two possible sketches...

@image{../images/logoa.png,80}
}
