| &#9744; Wow!
| &#9744; Getting There
| &#9744; Needs Improvement

| Sample Logo Study
| I described my favorite logo fully, and explained why I like it. I listed each and every specific color, image-producing function, and transformation function that the programmer used. I did not leave out any details.
| I described my favorite logo and explained why I like it. When I listed the functions that the programmer used, however, I missed one or two.
| My description of why I like a certain logo was brief. My list of the functions used by the programmer left out three or more functions.

| Drawing my Logo
| My logo sketch is attractive and creative. I've annotated the shapes and colors I plan to use.
| My logo sketch is attractive and creative, when I annotated, I forgot to label one or two shape and color names.
| My logo sketch looks nice, but I forgot to annotate three or more shape or color names.


| Circle of Evaluation
| My Circle of Evaluation shows my very best attempt to compose the functions in my logo. Every Circle has a function at the top and the order in which the functons are to be combined is clear and logical.
| My Circle of Evaluation shows a solid attempt to compose the functions in my logo but some logic, organization or details could be clearer.
| My Circle of Evaluation is hard for the reader to interpret.

| My Logo Program Submission
| Running my code produces no errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` looks very close to my drawing. I've commented thoughtfully on the thinking behind my logo.
| Running my code produces no errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` sort of looks like my drawing. My explanation is brief.
| Running my code produces errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` doesn't really look like my drawing. I forgot to include responses to the reflection question.
