| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| Sample Logo Study
| I described my favorite logo fully, and explained why I like it. I listed each and every specific color, image-producing function, and transformation function that the programmer used. I did not leave out any details.
| I described my favorite logo and explained why I like it. When I listed the functions that the programmer used, however, I missed one or two.
| My description of why I like a certain logo was brief. My list of the functions used by the programmer left out three or more functions.

| Drawing my Logo
| My logo sketch is attractive and creative. I've annotated the shapes and colors I plan to use.
| My logo sketch is attractive and creative, when I annotated, I forgot to label one or two shape and color names.
| My logo sketch looks nice, but I forgot to annotate three or more shape or color names.


| Circle of Evaluation
| My Circle of Evaluation shows my very best attempt to compose the functions in my logo. Every Circle has a function at the top, and one or more inputs at the bottom. My inputs are in the correct order, because I've used contracts to determine what belongs inside of each Circle. There are no syntax errors, because every String is in `"quotation marks"` and any decimals have at least one number to the left of the decimal point.
| My Circle of Evaluation shows a solid attempt to compose the functions in my logo. I've followed the rules for creating Circles. There are no more than three Contract or Syntax errors.
| My Circle of Evaluation is hard to for the reader to interpret, and occasionally breaks rules for creating Circles. I have made four or more Contract or Syntax errors.

| My Logo Program Submission
| Running my code produces no errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` looks very close to my drawing. I've responded thoughtfully via comment to the two reflection questions.
| Running my code produces no errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` looks a little like my drawing. My responses to the reflection questions are brief.
| Running my code produces errors. The logo that appears after typing in `my-logo` doesn't really look like my drawing. I forgot to include responses to the reflection question.
