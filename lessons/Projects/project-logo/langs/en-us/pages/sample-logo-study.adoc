= Sample Logo Study

Respond to the questions below using @starter-file{logos}.

@n First, we're going to look at three different sample logos.

- Hit "Run".
- Type `sample-logo-1` in the Interactions Area (right side) and hit enter. What do you see?
- Now type `sample-logo-2` in the Interactions Area. What does this logo look like?
- Finally, make `sample-logo-3` appear in your Interactions Area.

@n It's your turn! In the space below (or on a separate page), sketch out the logo of your dreams. You can make a logo to represent yourself, a friend, an activity or an artist that you loveâ€¦ the possibilities are endless.

@n Annotate your sketch. In other words, if you used a rhombus (or any other shape!), label it "rhombus". If one shape is a combination of a few shapes, label those. If something is "cornflower-blue" or "fire-brick" (or @link{https://pyret.org/docs/latest/color.html, "any other color!"}), make a note of that too.
