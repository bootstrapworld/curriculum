= Create Your Own Logo

Let's think more deeply about the logo we are going to create. You'll want to refer to your logo drawing in order to respond to the prompts below.

@n After getting feedback from a friend, are there any changes you'd like to make to your logo? @fitb{}{}

@n Put a checkmark by each of the **shape functions** that you are going to include in your logo. **You must choose at least two!** If you plan to use a function multiple times, you can add additional checkmarks next to it.

@n Draw a Circle of Evaluation to show how you will compose the functions you selected (above) in order to create your logo. If you need more space, use a separate sheet of paper.

@n Open Pyret. Log in. Translate your circle into code, then type that code into the Interactions Area and hit Enter. Did it work? @fitb{}{}

@n If your logo doesn't look like the one you drew, try again until it does. Describe one adjustment that you made. @fitb{}{}

@n Now, we're going to define `my-logo` so that typing `my-logo` produces _your logo_!

- Copy and paste your code from the Interactions Area (on the right) to the bottom the Definitions Area (on the left).
- Click "Run", and make sure your logo appears in the Interactions Area.
- At the beginning of your code, type `my-logo =`
- Click "Run", and type `my-logo` into the interactions area to make sure everything is working as it should! (You should see your logo!)

@n Add a comment to the Definitions Area describing (1) why you designed your logo the way you did, and (2) one thing you learned from completing this project.

@n Save your program. Select "File", then "Save a Copy."

@n Now, go to "Publish", and copy the link that appears. Follow your teacherâ€™s instructions and submit the link via email, google classroom, or some other method.
