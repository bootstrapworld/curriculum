= Designing Your Logo

== Design Your Logo

@n It's your turn! Think about what makes the logos you discussed memorable. In the space below (or on a separate page), draw a logo or design to represent yourself, a friend, an activity -- it's up to you.

@n Choose specific @link{https://pyret.org/docs/latest/color.html, " colors"} for your logo! If something is "tomato" or "chocolate", draw an arrow to the appropriate region and label it with the color's name.


== Plan Your Logo's Code

Let's think more deeply about the logo we are going to create. Refer to your logo drawing in order to respond to the prompts below.

@n Put a check mark by each of the *shape functions* that you are going to include in your logo. *You must choose at least two!* If you plan to use a function multiple times, you can add additional check marks next to it.

| * [ ] square
| * [ ] rectangle

| * [ ] text
| * [ ] rhombus
| * [ ] triangle

@n Put a check mark by each of the *transformation functions* that you are going to use in your logo. *You must choose at least two!* If you plan to use a function multiple times, you can add additional check marks next to it.
