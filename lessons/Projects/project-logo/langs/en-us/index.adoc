| Preparation
|
* Before launching this project, ensure that students are comfortable using image-producing functions and function composition.
* Note that for this project, students must submit three different components: (1) Sample Logo Study, (2) Create Your Own Logo, and (3) the link to their published Pyret program.
* This project is designed to span multiple days.

== Create Your Own Logo @duration{flexible}

=== Overview

Students design their logo and consider which functions they will need to compose in order to build it. Then, they represent their logo first with a Circle of Evaluation, next with code. Finally, they publish and share their logo.

=== Launch

@teacher{To launch this project, begin with a conversation about students' favorite logos. Then, invite students to study some sample logos (and the corresponding code that produced them!). Finally, students begin sketching their own logo design.

Before you dive in, we recommend printing and distributing the student-facing @opt-printable-exercise{logo-rubric.adoc} to help students understand the scope of the project and your expectations at the outset. Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the rubric for their unique classroom context.}

[.lesson-instruction]
- If I ask you to think of a logo (any logo!), what are some of the first that come to mind?
- What makes those particular logos memorable or unique?
** _Possible responses: They include bright colors. The font is interesting. The logo tells some sort of story._
- Open @starter-file{logos}. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
** _Possible Noticing: The programmer has formatted their code with lots of indentations! Possible Wondering: Why are there so many indentations?_
- Why do you think the programmer added so many indentations to their code?
** _The code becomes easier to interpret! There is a new line everytime a new function appears._
- Using the @starter-file{logos}, complete @printable-exercise{sample-logo-study.adoc}.

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete numbers 1-4 on @printable-exercise{create-your-own.adoc}.
- Discuss your work with your partner before finishing the worksheet.

@teacher{Number 7 on @printable-exercise{create-your-own.adoc}} walks students through __defining__ their logo as `my-logo`. We offer an entire lesson on @lesson-link{defining-values} that goes into more depth on this topic - but the notes in Number 7 should be adequate for the purposes of this project! You might want to highlight for students that this is a new skill, and their first time typing in the Definitions Area.}

@teacher{Also note that in number 9, students are asked to publish the link to their program and share it with their teacher. You may use a variety of methods for link submission including (but not limited to!) email, a web form, or your favorite LMS (Google Classroom, Schoology, etc).}

=== Synthesize

* Encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. Peer review is a powerful tool, when there's enough time for it! The @opt-printable-exercise{logo-rubric.adoc} is a useful resource for facilitating both self and peer review.

* Finally, celebrate students' work! In many instances, students will want to share their project, given how much time they have invested. Class or public presentations can instill a sense of pride.
