= WIP Project: Time-Use

@description{Students search for graphs about time use in the U.S. while tracking their own habits. _This project supports the learning goals of our lesson on @lesson-link{data-cycle}._}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

- search for relevant graphs on the internet to use as points of comparison

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

- Let's compare how we use our time to research about how U.S. Americans use their time.

@preparation{
- Make a copy of @link{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PklP5FhpsWlUrQU6UaV0OKYxzq_Pz5YheLoiGs3yTeM/copy, this Google form} and share a link with your students so that all of their responses will end up in the class' collective spreadsheet.
- None of the handouts for this project are in the workbook, so be sure to print copies of whatever you'll be distributing.
- Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the student-facing @handout{rubric-time-use.adoc} for their unique classroom context and distribute it to help students understand the scope of the project - and your expectations - at the outset.
}

| Facilitation Note
| 
Before students will be able to get to the analysis phase of this project, they will need at least 5 days to collect the data to generate the collective data set. Including at least one weekend for tracking snack habits will likely lead to richer data.

== Building a Data Set: How We Use Our Time

=== Overview

=== Launch


Confirm that students have correctly identified the data types.

@teacher{
Make sure you've made a copy of @scrub{@link{, this Google form}} and shared a link with your students.
}



=== Investigate

@teacher{
Reviewing the spreadsheet with students over the course of the next several days is a great opportunity to teach about data cleaning. Some teachers take a deeper dive into the topic during this phase of the project with our lesson on @lesson-link{data-collection}.
}

Project the spreadsheet each day and discuss as a class.

@lesson-instruction{
- Are there any inconsistencies in our data that we need to clean up before we will be able to import this sheet into Pyret?
- What ideas do you have for how we might address them?
} 

=== Synthesize



== Research: U.S. Time Use Data

=== Overview

Students will gather information from studies about US American snacking habits and compare them to the data we've just gathered as a class.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
Do you think the sample we've made of our snack habits is representative of snacking in the United States?
}

We don't have to guess! There's plenty of research out there for us to look at. In fact, enough data has been collected about childhood obesity in the United States that soda machines and unhealthy snacks have been pulled from many schools.

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Open your favorite search engine (Google, Brave, DuckDuckGo, etc.) and type +
"How do Americans spend their time?‚Äù
- Look for graphs that share information related to the kinds of data we're collecting about our own snacking habits.
- Use this to compare with your data and the class data.  
- What question does this inspire?
}

=== Synthesize



== Analysis: A Statistical Question of Your Own

=== Overview

=== Launch


=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Make your own copy of @scrub{@link{, this slide template}}.
- Edit each slide to share your thinking and findings. 
Add more slides if you need!  
}

=== Synthesize

- What were the pros and cons of working with data generated by you and your classmates?
- What other data do you wish had been part of our collective dataset? What other questions would you suggest adding to the form?

@teacher{
- Once finished, encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. 
- Decide what form of sharing their projects works best for you. 
  * Class presentations can instill a sense of pride. 
  * Presenting in small groups can take less time. 
  * You may also want to have them print some part of their presentation to display on a bulletin board.

- Did your students have brilliant suggestions for how we could improve the form for future classes? Please share your ideas with @link{mailto:contact@bootstrapworld.org}!
