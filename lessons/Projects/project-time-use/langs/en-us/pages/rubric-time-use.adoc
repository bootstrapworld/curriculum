| Data collection
| I filled in the tracking spreadsheet with accuracy and care. The time use log perfectly accurately represents how I spent my time over the designated five-day period.
| I filled in the tracking spreadsheet relatively accurately and carefully. I tried my best to give accurate information, but sometimes I made guesses about how I spent my time. Overall, the accuracy of the data collected is decent, however.
| I often forgot to fill in the tracking spreadsheet. I had to go back and dig through my memories to make educated guesses about my time use. The information recorded during the data collection phase is most likely not an accurate depiction of how I used my time.

| Summary of my time use trends (graphics)
| I’ve included a rich variety of plots, tables, and photographs to represent my time use over the five-day period.
| I have a few plots, tables, and photographs to represent my time use - but it is not crystal clear why I chose them or how they represent my time use trends.
| The plots, tables and photographs that I’ve included do not accurately represent my time use. It is confusing to the reader what I am trying to portray.

| Summary of my time use trends (writing)
| The text that I wrote accurately describes interesting trends that I observed when analyzing my time use. My written analysis clearly draws on the evidence that I provided via my graphics. As a result, the viewer has a clear sense of the time use trends that I uncovered.
| The text describing my time use would benefit from additional detail. It is not clear to the viewer that I have thoughtfully analyzed the data presented. My writing is sometimes evidence-based, but sometimes not..
| My written descriptions are confusing, leaving the viewer asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.

| Summary of America’s time use trends (slideshow)
| I’ve included a variety of plots, tables, and photos to represent America’s time use trends. I’ve credited the sources that I borrowed images from.
| I have a few plots, tables, and photographs to represent America’s time use trends - but it is not crystal clear why I chose them.
| The plots, tables and photographs that I’ve included do not adequately represent my America’s time use trends. It is confusing to the reader what I am trying to portray.

| Summary of America’s time use trends (writing)
| The text that I wrote highlights how America’s time use trends are alike and different from my own time use trends. My observations are clearly drawn from the data that I’ve shared and my arguments are compelling.
| The text describing America’s time use trends (and how they differ from my own) would benefit from additional detail. It is not clear to the viewer that I have thoughtfully analyzed the data presented. My writing is sometimes evidence-based, but sometimes not.
| My written descriptions are confusing, leaving the viewer asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.


| My statistical question and its answer (slideshow and writing)
| I developed a compelling and interesting statistical question based on the data I collected. I clearly answered that question by presenting plots, tables, photos and thoughtful written analysis.
| The statistical question I chose is not fully answered by the data presented. I have put in some effort to answer the question with plots, tables, photos and written analysis, but more detail is needed.
| My statistical question is simple and straightforward, and answering it did not require much critical analysis by me /// My statistical question was not adequately answered by my graphics and written analysis.


| Discussion of challenges (writing)
| I truthfully and honestly answered all questions about the challenges of this project. I addressed in detail how the project’s challenges might have affected the quality of my data.
| My discussion of the challenges of this project was brief and lacking in detail. I only partially addressed how this project’s challenges might have affected the quality of my data.
| I did not offer enough thoughtful discussion on the challenges of collecting data. It is not clear to the reader that I understand how challenges I encountered could affect the
