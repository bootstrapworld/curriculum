@description{Students come up with an original research question, conduct the analysis to find results, and share their findings.}

== Overview

This project can be used as the capstone for Bootstrap:Data Science, and is designed to provide real-world and engaging connections to the following math, computing, and data science concepts:

[cols="1a,1a", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
|
- Bar and Pie Charts
- Histograms and Box Plots
- Skew and Symmetry
- Measures of Center & Spread
- Strength and Direction of Correlations
- Linear Regression
- Random and Grouped Sampling

|
- Outliers and Extreme Values
- Data Types and Representations of Data
- Functions and Variables
- Looping and Iteration
- Sorting, Filtering and Transforming Tables
- Importing Data
- Ethics, Privacy and Bias
|===

In addition, this project can address _domain-specific learning goals_ that are appropriate for your classroom. For example, students in a Physics class, might write their paper about data they collected from an experiment.

Many Bootstrap teachers arrange publishing parties or data fairs, complete with tri-fold posters explaining their findings.

=== Students will be able to...

* Use the Data Cycle to develop new questions from the findings their initial questions lead them to
* Identify and explore grouped samples from within their dataset
* Identify Threats to Validity

=== Assessment and Grading
We provide a student-facing @opt-printable-exercise{research-paper-rubric.html, rubric for the paper}, but teachers should always feel free to edit and adapt it for their classroom.
