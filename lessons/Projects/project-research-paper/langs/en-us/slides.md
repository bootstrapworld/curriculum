# Create a Research Project

Data Science is the process of learning from data. Any learning that _you_ do from _your_ data needs to be motivated by a *good question* - one that will produce new insights and rich discussion. That means it can't be too vague, too broad, or too specific!

While working on your Data Exploration, you honed in on a few questions worth further investigation. Let's think about which of those questions would be the best for further study.

# Create a Research Project

In small groups, share and discuss the questions that you found most interesting. Let your peers share their gut reactions to your questions, then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each question.


@teacher{Choosing an appropriate question is the first step toward a successful research project! Some students will likely be confident in their question(s), while others will need to revise and rethink their question(s). This discussion is intended to be an open conversation, allowing students the opportunity to pick the best question for them.}

# Create a Research Project

We are going to spend a lot of class time working on our research projects.

- Let's preview the @starter-file{research-project} to give you a sense of *what* you will be creating.
- But first, take out @handout{research-project-rubric.adoc, "both"} @handout{research-project-rubric-2.adoc, "pages"} of your rubric.
- As we move through the template, ask questions about the rubric descriptors if they are unclear or confusing to you. Use a highlighter to indicate if anything seems especially important on the rubric.
- There are *four* sections of the project: (1) About this Dataset, (2) Research Questions, (3) Analysis, and (4) Discussion.
- Let's talk through the first two sections together.

@teacher{Walk students through sections 1 and 2 of the @starter-file{research-project}, inviting questions and conversation along the way. We've offered some talking points for Sections 3 and 4, as the bulk of student work takes place there.

Explain to students that the bulk of their analysis will happen in the third section of the template - which is where they tell their data stories. In telling their data story, students can use displays from the exploration paper... but some will likely not be worth including! Most students will likely need to make more displays in order to tell the best story that they can.

The @starter-file{research-project} includes every single type of graph that students made during the Data Exploration. They should only use the displays that are relevant to answering their research question. Students should plan to include a wide array of charts and displays to tell their story, although there is no requirement to include each type of display.

If you are also requiring students to submit a written research report, we recommend introducing this component _after_ students have completed and submitted their slide decks. When introducing the @starter-file{research-project}, you can share with students @starter-file{research-paper}, so they know what to expect when it's time to write up their findings.}

# Create a Research Project

Customize your slides! Add graphics and beautify the slide deck.

Spend some time self-assessing using @handout{research-project-rubric.adoc, "both"} @handout{research-project-rubric-2.adoc, "pages"} of your rubric.
