| I selected at least two columns in my dataset, and correctly filled out the entire summary table for each one. Based on these measures, I was able to pick which measure of center was best for each column, and I provided a detailed interpretation of what these measures tell me about the dataset.
| I selected at least two columns in my dataset, and correctly filled out the entire summary table for each one. I tried to interpret what these measures tell me about the dataset, but my interpretation lacked detail.
| I selected two columns in my dataset, and filled out most of the table. My interpretation was mostly restating the numbers from the table.

| I added at least two slides that include correct descriptions of correlations that I observed. I also included the accompanying scatter plots and detailed descriptions of those plots. For at least one of my correlations, I included an additional slide displaying the relevant linear regression plot and a thoughtful interpretation of it.
| I added at least two slides that include __mostly__ correct descriptions of correlations that I observed.  I also included the accompanying scatter plots and brief descriptions of those plots. For one of my correlations, I included an additional slide displaying the relevant linear regression plot and a cursory interpretation of it.
| I added one slide that includes an inaccurate description of a correlation that I observed. I failed to include the accompanying scatter plot and / or a description of it. I either left out the linear regression of that correlation, or offered an incorrect interpretation of it.

| I had lots of questions by the end of the exploration, and I chose at least two that I thought were most interesting. I explained why I thought they were interesting, and wrote about grouped samples that might be good to explore when answering those questions.
