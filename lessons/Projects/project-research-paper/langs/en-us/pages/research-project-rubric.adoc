| &#9744; Needs Improvement

| I used a variety of categorical and quantitative visualizations, including at least 10 different visualizations in my project. I gave each display a descriptive title. I specified how the display changed my thinking and influenced the next display that I chose to make.
| Throughout my project, I used a limited assortment of visualizations. I included at least 8 different visualizations in my project. Most of my visualizations were descriptively titled. I attempted to describe how the display changed my thinking and influenced the next display that I made -- but my descriptions were unclear.
| I included 4 or fewer visualizations in my project. The visualizations did not include titles, or the titles were not descriptive. I did not adequately describe how each display changed my thinking.

| I explained my findings clearly and in detail. I also wrote about possible threats to validity, considering all of the different threats we learned about in the context of diversity, bias, power, and discrimination. I explained why (or why not) the results were enough to make a strong claim. I thought about the ethical implications of collecting this data, or how my research might be used in good or bad ways. I wrote about how I would continue this research, with more data and/or more questions.
| I explained my findings, and wrote about some threats to validity and ethical questions. I considered some issues regarding diversity, bias, power and discrimination -- but not all of them. I wrote about possible ways to continue the research.
| I talked about my findings, but only discussed some threats to validity, ethics, or possible future research. Other parts were missing.
