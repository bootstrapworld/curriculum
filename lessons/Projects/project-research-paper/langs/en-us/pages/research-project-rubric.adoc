| I explained why this dataset is interesting to me, others like me, and why others should care about this data. I considered why the dataset was collected, and what purpose it might serve. I correctly identified all the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.
| I explained why this dataset was interesting to me and at least one other person/group, and shared _something_ about where it came from. I correctly identified most of the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.

| I had lots of questions by the end of the exploration, and I chose at least two that I thought were most interesting. I explained why I thought they were interesting, and wrote about grouped samples that might be good to explore when answering those questions.

| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| I used a variety of categorical and quantitative displays, including at least 10 different displays in my project. I gave each display a descriptive title. I specified how the display changed my thinking and influenced the next display that I chose to make.
| Throughout my project, I used a limited assortment of displays. I included at least 8 different displays in my project. Most of my displays were descriptively titled. I attempted to describe how the display changed my thinking and influenced the next display that I made - but my descriptions were unclear.
| I included 4 or fewer displays in my project. The displays did not include titles, or the titles were not descriptive. I did not adequately describe how each display changed my thinking.

*Discussion: Threats to Validity, Ethical Implications, Questions for Future Study*

[cols="4,4,4", options="header"]

| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| I explained my findings clearly and in detail. I also wrote about possible threats to validity, considering all of the different threats we learned about in the context of diversity, bias, power, and discrimination. I explained why (or why not) the results were enough to make a strong claim. I thought about the ethical implications of collecting this data, or how my research might be used in good or bad ways. I wrote about how I would continue this research, with more data and/or more questions.
| I explained my findings, and wrote about some threats to validity and ethical questions. I considered some issues regarding diversity, bias, power and discrimination - but not all of them. I wrote about possible ways to continue the research.
| I talked about my findings, but only discussed some threats to validity, ethics, or possible future research. Other parts were missing.
