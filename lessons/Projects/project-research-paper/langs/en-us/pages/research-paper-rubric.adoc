| Wow!
| Getting There
| Needs Improvement

| Title Page
| I have a great title for the paper that would make somebody else want to ready it!
I've included the names for my teacher and everyone who worked on the paper. I have links to my Pyret file as well as the spreadsheet for the dataset, and the date is updated to most recent time I saved it.
| My title isn't interesting, but it's usable. I've included the names for my teacher and everyone who worked on the paper. I've got links to my Pyret file as well as the spreadsheet for the dataset, and the date is updated to most recent time I saved it.
| I am missing one or more of the elements needed for the title page.

| About the Data
| I explained why this dataset is interesting to me, others like me, and why others should care about this data. I considered why the dataset was collected, who collected it, and how bias, power, and discrimination may or may not have played a role in the collection. I correctly identified all the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.
| I explained why this dataset was interesting to me and at least one other person/group, and shared _something_ about where it came from.  I wrote a little about how bias, power, or discrimination could have played a role in the collection. I correctly identified most of the rows, columns, and types in my dataset.
| I explained why this dataset was interesting to me, and shared _something_ about where it came from. I correctly identified some rows, columns, and types in my dataset.

| Research Question(s)
| I've explained the research question(s) carefully and clearly, and I've written about why these questions are important and who might care about the answers.
| I've explained the research question(s), and why they are important to me.
| I've written my research question(s).

| Analysis
| I've explained why I need to filter or transform the dataset, and given examples of the code I used. I've written about my Data Stories, explaining each step of my analysis, and how each analysis led me to another Data Story. I've included images of relevant and interesting displays, as well as specific measures of center and spread. Each one is explained thoroughly.
| I've explained which filters or transformations I needed to do, and I wrote about the steps I took to answer my research questions. I included images of displays, as well as  measures of center and spread. Each one has some explanation.
| There were some filters or transformations that I used, but I did not write about them. The images of displays that I used were not always relevant to the research question, and I did not explain them fully.

| Discussion
| I explained my findings clearly and in detail. I also wrote about possible threats to validity, considering all of the different threats we learned about in the context of diversity, bias, power, and discrimination. I explained why (or why _not_) the results were enough to make a strong claim. I thought about the ethical implications of collecting this data, or how my research might be used in good or bad ways. I wrote about how I would continue this research, with more data and/or more questions.
| I explained my findings, and wrote about some threats to validity and ethical questions. I considered some issues regarding diversity, bias, power and discrimination - but not all of them. I wrote about possible ways to continue the research.
| I talked about my findings, but only discussed _some_ threats to validity, ethics, or possible future research. Other parts were missing.
