@preparation{
- Make a copy of @link{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PklP5FhpsWlUrQU6UaV0OKYxzq_Pz5YheLoiGs3yTeM/copy, this Google form} and share a link with your students so that all of their responses will end up in the class' collective spreadsheet.
- None of the handouts for this project are in the workbook, so be sure to print copies of whatever you'll be distributing.
- Teachers are welcome and encouraged to edit and adapt the student-facing rubric for their unique classroom context and distribute it to help students understand the scope of the project - and your expectations - at the outset.

| Facilitation Note

Before students will be able to get to the analysis phase of this project, they will need at least 5 days to collect the data to generate the collective data set.

@lesson-instruction{

=== Synthesize

- What were the pros and cons of working with data generated by you and your classmates?
- What other data do you wish had been part of our collective data set? What other questions would you suggest adding to the form?

@teacher{
- Once finished, encourage students to self-assess and revise their work. 
- Decide what form of sharing their projects works best for you. 
  * Class presentations can instill a sense of pride. 
  * Presenting in small groups can take less time. 
  * You may also want to have them print some part of their presentation to display on a bulletin board.
- Did your students have brilliant suggestions for how we could improve the form for future classes? Please share your ideas with @link{contact@bootstrapworld.org}!
