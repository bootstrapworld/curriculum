| Data collection
| _This data is an accurate reflection of my stress level._ I completed the stress survey each morning, afternoon, and evening. If I was unable to complete the form at the required time, I completed it as soon as possible. I gave accurate information by observing my mood and my surroundings.
|  _This data is a decent reflection of my stress level._ I sometimes forgot to fill in the stress survey. When I responded to the prompts, I tried my best to give accurate information, but sometimes I made guesses because I couldn't quite remember the details.
| _This data not a great reflection of my stress level._ I often forgot to fill in the stress survey. I had to go back and dig through my memories to make guesses about stress at various points throughout the day.

| Summary of my stress levels (graphics)
| I included many visualizations (including box plots!), numerical summaries, and photographs to represent my stress levels over the five-day period.
| I have some visualizations, numerical summaries, and photographs to represent my stress levels -- but I didn't choose them for any particular reason and they don't precisely represent my stress.
| The visualizations, numerical summaries, and photographs that I’ve included do not accurately represent my stress. What I wrote is not as clear as it could be.

| Summary of my stress levels (writing)
| The text that I wrote accurately describes trends that I observed when analyzing my stress. My writing clearly draws on the evidence that I provided via my graphics. As a result, the reader has a clear sense of my typical stress level and what factors affect it.
| The text describing my stress level and stressors could use some extra detail. It is not clear that I have thoughtfully analyzed the data presented. My writing is not always based in the data and evidence I supplied.
| My writing is unclear or confusing, leaving the reader asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.

| Summary of class stress levels (graphics)
| I’ve included a variety of visualizations and numerical summaries to represent our class stress levels and stressors over the five-day period.
| I have a few visualizations and numerical summaries to represent our class stress levels and stressors, but I didn't have a specific reason for choosing them.
| My visualizations and numerical summaries do not adequately represent our class stress levels and stressors. What I wrote is not as clear as it could be.

| Summary of class stress levels (writing)
| The text that I wrote compares my stress levels and stressors to those of the class. My observations are clearly drawn from the data that I’ve shared and my arguments are convincing.
| The text that I wrote, comparing my stress levels and stressors to those of the class, would benefit from additional detail. My writing is not always based in the data and evidence I supplied.
| My written descriptions are confusing, leaving the reader asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.
