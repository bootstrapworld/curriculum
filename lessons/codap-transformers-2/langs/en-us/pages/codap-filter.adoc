== Creating a "Filter" Transformer

Open the Transformers plugin, and select `Filter`.

@n Enter a `filter-is-fixed` as the name. What does this name tell you about the Transformer you are creating?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_The Transformer will filter out only animals that are fixed._}}

@n Which dataset should we select? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Animals Dataset_}}

@n Examine the contract. Why does the provided contract make sense?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_The expression will consume a Row and produce a Boolean._}}

@n Write a purpose statement.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_The expression will consume a Row and produce a Boolean._}}

- Enter `Fixed = true` as the expression.

@n Select `Apply Transformer`. What happens?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_A copy of the original dataset is created, with only animals that are fixed._}}

== More Filtering

- Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-old` that creates a new dataset with animals older than 5 years.

- Create, save, and apply a Transformer called `filter-is-dog` that creates a new dataset with only dogs.
