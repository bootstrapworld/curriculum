| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Connecting representations of Tables and Graphs
* Lines are made of points (try to avoid refering to "lines" as much as "collections of points")
* Linear relationships, defined as _rules that generate one value from another_. These rules form straight lines on a graph and sequences that change at a constant rate in a table

== Simple Sequences and Straight Lines @duration{35 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the concept of _linearity_, as represented in tables and graphs.

=== Launch
Have students turn to @printable-exercise{notice-and-wonder.adoc}, where they'll notice and wonder about the rows in this table and the points on this graph:

[cols="^.^1a,^.^1a", grid="none", frame="none"]

[.lesson-instruction]
- What do you *Notice*?
- What do you *Wonder*?

Each row in the Table represents an (x, y) point on the graph. The "x" column is a list of positions along the x-axis, and the "y" column is filled with values that are computed from those position according to some rule.

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you predict the next two rows in the table? The next points on the graph? __How did you arrive at your prediction?__

The y-column in the table and the y-coordinates on the graph follow a _rule_, which dictates how @math{y} relates to @math{x}. When @math{x} goes up or down by 1, @math{y} goes up or down by 2. We expect that rule to continue for all values of @math{x}, continuing the line and extending the table in both directions, forever.

[.lesson-point]
*Linear Relationships*: Sequences that change at a constant rate, or points forming a straight line on a graph.

Rules that behave this way are called @vocab{linear} relationships. In a linear relationship, if the x-values in a table increase at a constant rate, the y-values in the table will also change at a constant rate. When we plot the x and y-coordinates on a graph, the contant rate of change translates to all of the points falling on the same line and that line not only includes the points represented in the table, but also all of the coordinate pairs that satisfy the same rule, including lots of points whose x and y values are fractions and decimals.

Linear relationships are _everywhere_:

* "A car is traveling at 50 miles per hour"
* "Milk costs $2.50 per gallon"
* "There are 18 wheels on every tractor-trailer"
* "A tree grows 2 inches each year"
* "There are 30 students per teacher"

[.lesson-instruction]
* What other linear relationships can you think of?

=== Investigate

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{notice-wonder-tables.adoc}, where they'll notice and wonder about the two "sideways" data tables below.

[cols="^.^1a,^.^1a", frame="none"]

!===
! x !   1 !   2 !   3 !   4 !   5
! y ! -12 ! -14 ! -16 ! -18 ! -20
!===

|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- What do you *Notice?*
- What do you *Wonder?*
- Can you figure out what the next (x,y) pair should be for each of them?  
- Can you guess what the y-value for each table would be when x is 0?

We can think of the "x" column as counting the __order in which the y-values appear__ (1st value, 2nd value, etc). The "y" column, on the other hand is computed from the x-values according to some function.

When there is a @vocab{linear} relationship, the y-values change at a _constant rate_. If we were to graph those values, all of the points would fall on a straight line.

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note}

To encourage students to look at the _points_ in the table and graph, it is useful to change the scale of the graphs so that all lines look the same. This prevents students from leaning on visual cues like "steepness" to bypass the learning objective.

It can also be useful to list the points in the table __out of order__, both to focus students' attention on the points and to drive home that rows do not have to be ordered!
|===

[.lesson-point]
Axes on a graph need an order. Rows in a table don't!

The rows in a table are _discrete_. They preserve their meaning if the rows are shuffled into a different order. Ordering the rows in a table can make it easier for us to find the function.

In a graph, the points on the x-axis _cannot_ be shuffled, because the x-axis must always be ordered. We can stretch the _scale_ of the axes to making the lines _look_ different, but the points will always be in the same order.

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you match tables and graphs, even if the rows are shuffled and the axes are changed? Complete @printable-exercise{pages/match-tables-graphs2.adoc}.

=== Synthesize
@vocab{Linear} relationships show up all the time in real life, so it's helpful to know how to think about them. We've seen that linear relationships can be represented as tables and graphs. Tables only show us _some points_ on a line, whereas a line itself is made up of an _infinite_ number of points. While a table represents a _sample_ of some larger trend, the graph is a way of seeing the trend itself.

== Linear, Non-Linear, or Bust!  @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students deepen their understanding of linearity, by seeing counterexamples (non-linear relationships), as well as tables and graphs for which there is _no_ relationship.

=== Launch

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{graphs-all-linear.adoc}, where they'll Notice & Wonder about the six graphs below and consider the question,
__If all linear relationships can be shown as points on a graph, does that mean all graphs are linear?__

[.lesson-instruction]
- What do you *Notice?*
- What do you *Wonder?*

[.lesson-point]
Linear relationships in a graph always appear as straight lines

Three of the graphs above represent @vocab{linear} relationships, and three show other, non-linear relationships. As we can see, the linear graphs can go in lots of directions and non-linear relationships can follow patterns that aren't linear!

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{tables-all-linear.adoc}, where they'll Notice & Wonder about the six tables below and consider the question,
__If all linear relationships can be shown as tables, does that mean all tables are linear?__

- What do you *Notice?*
- What do you *Wonder?*
- Can you figure out what the next x,y pair should be for each of them?  
- Can you guess what the y-value for each table would be when x is 0?

[.lesson-point]
Linear relationships in a table show up as sequences that change at a constant rate. The y-value when x is zero is also the value where the line will cross the y-axis.

Three of the tables above show a @vocab{linear} relationships, and three show other, non-linear relationships. As we can see, the linear tables can have y-values that change by zero (no change), by a positive number (constant increase), or a negative number (constant decrease) as the x-values increase. While the other tables may show patterns, they aren't linear!

Sometimes there is __no function__ that will give us a particular table or graph! Take a look at the table and points below. Can you predict the next two rows? Where will the next point be?

=== Synthesize
Data has a "shape", and this shape can emerge when we look for patterns in that data. A @vocab{linear} function is one kind of pattern, and we can see it when viewing data as a table or a graph.

== Is it a Function?

=== Launch

* Imagine a horizontal linear relationship where @math{y = 3} ("for all values of x, _y_ is three"). By what amount is y changing as x-increases by one?
* Now imagine a vertical linear relationship where @math{x = 3} ("for all values of y, _x_ is three"). By what amount is y changing as x-increases by one?

=== Investigate

A linear _relationship_ can exist from x-to-y, or from y-to-x. The two relationships described above are both linear!

But a linear _function_ is strictly x-to-y. We can also describe this as "input-to-output", or "Domain to Range." **Not all linear relationships are linear functions!** Linear functions can only have one possible y-value for a single x-value, so our horizontal line @math{f(x) = 3} can be written as a function but our vertical line @math{f(y) = 3} cannot.

[.lesson-point]
*Linear Functions:* linear rules that only work from __x to y__.

=== Synthesize
[.lesson-point]
Vertical Line Test: If there are two different @math{y} values for the same @math{x}, it can't be a function!

Think back to our vertical line @math{f(y) = 3}: x is three __all the time__, for an infinite number of y-values. If multiple y-values come from the same x-value, we know it's not a function. In math books, this is called the _vertical line test_.
