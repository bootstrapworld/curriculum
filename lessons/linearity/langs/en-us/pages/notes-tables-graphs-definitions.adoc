= Linear Relationships

A relationship between two variables is *linear* if one changes at a _constant rate_ relative to the other. Here are a few examples of linear relationships:

- A car driving at 40mph will travel exactly 40 miles for each additional hour
- A lemonade stand that sells cups of lemonade for $0.75/ea will charge exactly $0.75 for each additional glass

We can see linear relationships show up in *Tables*, *Graphs*, and *Function Definitions*:

In *Graphs*, linear relationships appear as points that form a _straight line_. These lines have a _slope_ ("rise over run") and a y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis, at x=0).

In *Tables*, linear relationships show up as y-values that change by a _constant rate_ relative to their x-values.

We can _define_ linear relationships using *Function Definitions* (either in __function notation__ or Pyret code). Linear functions always include a term for the slope and another for the y-intercept.

If you know how to read the slope and y-intercept for Tables, Graphs and Definitions, you can switch back and forth between each representation. This flexibility is good: sometimes it's just easier to look at a table or a graph, or see the definition!
