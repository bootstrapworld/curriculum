@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. +
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-exploring-quadratics-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- Unlike linear functions, which are governed by slope and y-intercept, quadratic functions are governed by the behavior of _three_ factors.
- Students should gain an intuition for these factors by playing with them first in Desmos, then use them to fit a model in Pyret.

== Quadratic Functions @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to quadratic functions. They become familiar with scenarios involving quadratics and terminology to describe parabolas. They also learn how to identify quadratic sequences, and then explore each of the coefficients in Vertex Form.

=== Launch
Linear models work well for fitting simple relationships, but many relationships in the real world are more complex! _Linear models are often too primitive_.

The relationship we observe between speed and fuel efficiency appears to best be described by a _curve_, where fuel-efficiency increases up to a certain speed, and then decreases again.

@slidebreak

Today, we will learn about one kind of curved model called a @vocab{quadratic relationship}.  Graphs of quadratic relationships are often described as "u-shaped" or "looking like an arch". More formally, mathematicians and data scientists call these kinds of curves @vocab{parabolas}.

There are lots of relationships that change direction like this! For example, when an athlete is young, they improve as they get stronger and more skilled. But as they age, they begin to lose their speed and strength.

In some quadratic relationships, the curve goes the other way - decreasing, bottoming out, and then rising again. For example, the graph of an accelerating car's position over time will look like the right-half of a downward-facing parabola, with the car covering more distance each second than last.

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{Can you think of any other real-world relationships that appear to be quadratic?}
@A{A ball dropped from a tall building will get faster and faster as it falls, so a graph of distance v. time will be quadratic.}
@A{Many nutrients are good for you, and the more you take the healthier you are...up to a point. After that, too much of a mineral or vitamin can cause problems. A graph of health outcomes v. nutrient consumption will be quadratic.}
@A{A ball thrown in the air will rise quickly, slow down, peak, and then begin to fall. A graph of the ball's height v. time will be quadratic.}
@A{The temperature of a puddle will warm and then cool over the course of the day. A graph of temperature v. time will be quadratic.}
@A{The length of a shadow is long in the morning and shortens til the sun is overhead, after which it slowly lengthens til the sun sets. A graph of shadow-length v. time will be quadratic.}

Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-descriptions.adoc} and practice identifying whether the scenarios are best modeled by linear or quadratic relationships.

=== Investigate
Although the examples we just discussed include the characteristic rising and falling or falling and rising of the parabola, we might encounter datasets that include only the _rising_ part of the parabola or only the _falling_ part.

But what if our list of x-y pairs, doesn't show a rise-and-fall. How do we know if we're looking at _just the rise_ or a parabola, or _just the fall_, or something that _isn't a parabola at all?_ In other words:+
*How can we identify quadratic relationships from a sequence of numbers?*

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/difference-table-linear.png}}Remember that linear functions grow by _fixed intervals,_ so the rate of change is _constant_. In the table shown here, each time the x-value increases by 1, we see that the y-value increases by 2. This is true for any set of equal-sized intervals: a line needs to slope up or down at a constant rate in order to be a straight line! +
@vspace{1ex} +
*If the rate of growth is constant, the relationship is linear.*

@clear
@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/difference-table-quadratic.png}}Quadratic functions grow by intervals that _increase by fixed amounts!_ In the table to the right, the blue arrows show a differently-sized jump between identical intervals time, meaning _the function is definitely not linear!_ However, if we take a look at the _difference between those differences_(shown in red), we're back to constant growth! +
@vspace{1ex} +
*If the "growth of the growth" is constant, the relationship is quadratic.*

@teacher{Debrief with students and allow them to share the different strategies that they used. Note: When looking at real-world datasets that can be modeled by linear or quadratic functions, these patterns will not be evident in the tables, because the points won't fit the function perfectly!}

When we graph these points on a plane, they draw our @vocab{parabola}. As we work with parabolas - and eventually fit them to our Fuel Efficiency dataset - we need to know how to talk about and describe them. +
*Let's define the parts of a parabola together.*

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{Linear relationships can be described with terms like "slope" and "y-intercept". But what about quadratic relationships? Do parabolas have slope?}
@A{No. They curve because they *do not* have a constant rate of change.}
@Q{Do all parabolas have x-intercepts?}
@A{No. Some do and some don't!}
@Q{Can you point out or describe other important parts of a parabola?}
@A{Even without knowing the names for these things, students might point to the vertex, the axis of symmetry, etc.}

| The point at which a parabola "changes direction" and goes from climbing to sinking (or vice versa).
| Like linear models, parabolas always cross the y-axis once when @math{x=0}.
| Also known as @vocab{roots} or @vocab{zeros}. A quadratic function can cross the x-axis once, twice, or not at all.
|===

There are two more specific terms that we can use to describe a parabola's @vocab{vertex}:

- The @vocab{maximum} is the vertex of a parabola that "opens up."
- The @vocab{minimum} is the vertex of a parabola that "opens down."

For parabolas representing @math{y} as a quadratic function of @math{x}, we can imagine a vertical line through the @vocab{vertex} that splits the curve into two congruent parts that mirror each other. This line is the @vocab{axis of symmetry}, which for quadratics always passes through the vertex (these axes exist in other shapes and functions, as well!).

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @printable-exercise{parabolas.adoc} to apply our new terminology by sketching and labeling some graphs.
}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{What key characteristics of a scatter plot would provide the clue that we should look for a quadratic model rather than a linear model?}
@Q{Why do some parabolas have roots and others don't?}
@A{If the minimum is negative, it will fall below the x-axis and the parabola will cross the x-axis twice as it opens up so there will be two roots. Similarly, there will be two roots if the maximum is positive.}
@A{If the minimum or maximum is zero it will fall directly on the x-axis and there will be one root}
@A{If the minimum is greater than zero or the maximum is less than zero, the parabola won't cross the x-axis and there won't be any roots.}
@Q{What is the difference between a minimum and a maximum?}
@A{A minimum is the vertex of a parabola that opens up, while a maximum is the vertex of a parabola that opens down.}
