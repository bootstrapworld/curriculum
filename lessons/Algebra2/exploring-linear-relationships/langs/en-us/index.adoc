== Looking for Patterns @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the State Demographics dataset, and create scatter plots to search for relationships between columns. They share and discuss their findings with the class.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Today we'll be looking at data from each state in the US, and searching for possible relationships within the data!
- Open the @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=10bWYM4rOq_ZshtX6_M-xf-bPbfz61rd1, State Demographics Starter File}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete questions 1 and 2 in @printable-exercise{exploring-states.adoc}.

Have students share back what they Notice and Wonder about the dataset.

=== Investigate

The code on lines 13 and 14 show us how Pyret defines values:

```
alabama = row-n(states-table, 0)
alaska  = row-n(states-table, 1)
```

Just as in math, the code `x = 4` will define a variable `x` to be the value `4`. But in Pyret, values can be more than just numbers! The variables `alabama` and `alaska` were _rows_ from the table.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete question 3 (making displays and suggesting possible relationships) in @printable-exercise{exploring-states.adoc}.
- **Do not go on to question 4!** We'll be returning to that later in the lesson.

Note: during this activity, don't let students just make scatter plot for random pairs of columns. Instead, encourage them to first _think about which columns might be related_, and then create the scatter plot to search for this relationship. The dataset is designed so that students will quickly begin searching for relationships between varying levels of education and income, and there are linear relationships in each of these.

=== Synthesize

- Share your scatter-plots with one another (copying and pasting scatter plot displays into a shared document, for example, and then labeling those displays). What possible relationships did you find in question 2?

== Measuring the Strength of a Pattern @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students identify and make use of correlations in scatter plots, learning to characterize their form as being linear, curved, or showing no clear pattern. They learn how to describe the @vocab{strength} of correlations, and that linear patterns have direction.

=== Launch
We can use a histogram or box-plot to analyze a single quantitative variable, such as `hs-or-higher` or `pop-2010` to identify a value that is **typical**, how much the values **vary**, and what kind of values are **usual or unusual**.

But those tell us nothing about the _relationship_ between those variables. In order to understand such relationships, we have to expand our view from one column to two. This goes hand-in-hand with expanding our display from a 1-dimensional histogram or box plot to a 2-dimensional scatter plot.

When we build scatter plots, we are searching for a pattern - or @vocab{correlation} between two quantitative variables. Sometimes a pattern looks like a straight line, or a curve, or a hockey stick. And sometime, there's no clear shape at all! The shape of these patterns is called @vocab{form}.

[.lesson-point]
Form indicates whether a relationship is linear, non-linear or undefined.

@right{@image{images/1b1.gif, 250}} Some patterns are @vocab{linear}, and cluster around a straight line sloping up or down.

@clear

@right{@image{images/2NL.gif, 250}} Some patterns are **non-linear**, and may look like a curve or an arc.

@clear

@right{@image{images/B.gif, 250}} And sometimes there is **no relationship** or pattern at all!

@clear
[.lesson-point]
Linear relationships have direction

For straight-line relationships, we can talk about _direction:_

@right{@image{images/C.gif, 200 }}**Positive**: the line slopes up as we look from left-to-right. Positive relationships are by far the most common because of natural tendencies for variables to increase in tandem. For example, “the older the animal, the more it tends to weigh”. This is usually true for human animals, too!

@clear

@right{@image{images/A.gif, 200}}**Negative**: the line slopes _down_ as we look from left-to-right. Negative relationships can also occur. For example, “the older a child gets, the fewer new words he or she learns each day.”

@clear

NOTE: Not every shape has a direction! For example, a curve can start out sloping upwards, but then peak and slope downwards.

[.lesson-point]
Strength indicates how closely the two variables are correlated.

How well does knowing the x-value allow us to predict what the y-value will be?

@right{@image{images/A.gif, 200}}**A relationship is strong if knowing the x-value of a data point gives us a very good idea of what its y-value will be** (knowing a student's age gives us a very good idea of what grade they're in). A strong linear relationship means that the points in the scatter plot are all clustered _tightly_ around an invisible line.

@clear

@right{@image{images/1a.gif, 200}}**A relationship is weak if x tells us little about y** (a student's age doesn't tell us much about their number of siblings). A weak linear relationship means that the cloud of points is scattered very _loosely_ around the line.

@clear


=== Investigate

Now that you've dug into the role the form, direction and strength play in quantifying a correlation, it's time to put those concepts to work!

[.lesson-instruction]
In pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{pages/identifying-form-matching.adoc}.

Review student answers, and have students _explain their thinking_ for this activity. For students who are struggling, hearing what their peers are looking for is especially helpful at this stage.

[.lesson-instruction]
In pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{pages/identifying-form.adoc}

Review student answers. Some of the answers are not so clear-cut, and students may disagree about what constitutes a "strong" vs. "weak" correlation. We've tried to choose scatter plots that clearly fall into on category or the other, but without diving into the algorithm for linear regression students may find this exercise somewhat subjective.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Students often conflate strength and direction, thinking that a strong correlation _must_ be positive and a weak one _must_ be negative.
- Students may also falsely believe that there is ALWAYS a correlation between any two variables in their dataset.
- Students often believe that strength and sample size are interchangeable, leading to mistaken assumptions like "any correlation found in a million data points _must_ be strong!"


=== Synthesize

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Return to @printable-exercise{exploring-states.adoc}, and look at the possible relationships you listed in question 2.

- On your own paper, put a star by any relationships that you think might be linear.

- Place a "P" by any relationships (above) that were positive.

- Place an "N" by any relationships (above) that were negative.

- Place an "S" by the strongest-looking relationship you found.

- Place a "W" by the weakest-looking relationship you found.
--

Have students discuss the form, direction and strength of the relationships they investigated.


== Making Predictions with Linear Models @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

The line of best fit is framed as a _predictor function_, which attempts to predict where a new point would fall on the plane based on the relationship in the data. Students define their predictors (linear functions) to find the line of best fit, using @vocab{R-squared} to determine fitness and making predictions with the result. They explore the impact that slope and and y-intercept have on fitness.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
In Pyret, make a scatter plot showing the the relationship between `college-or-higher` and `median-household-income`.

@center{@image{images/college-v-income.png}}

This scatter plot appears to show a positive, linear relationship: states with higher percentages of college graduates tend to have higher median household incomes.

[.lesson-instruction]
**Suppose the United States were to add a new state**. What median household income would you predict for that state, if exactly 50% of its citizens had attended college? What about 90%? 10%

Let students discuss, and explain their thinking. If possible, mark off a single point for each of the hypothetical percentages, then connect those points to show a straight line. Note that some of these new points would require changing the x- and y-axes of our display!

When we see patterns in data, we can use those patterns to __make predictions__ based on that data. We can even draw a line to show all the possible predictions at once! These predictions represent our "best guess" at the underlying relationship in the data, as we try to model that relationship using math.

These models are just functions being graphed on top of the scatter plot, with the goal of minimizing the distance between the line and all the points on the plot. For straight-line relationships, these are _linear functions_ or "linear models". The straight-line graph of these models is sometimes called the "regression line" or the "predictor function", but you may have heard it called the @vocab{line of best fit}.

When we make a model, we want it to be the closest possible approximation of all the points. A "good fit" has most of the points very close to the line, and a "bad fit" has the points very far away.


=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete the first section ("Build a Model from Samples") in @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income.adoc}.
- Discuss as a class: how well did your model work for Alabama and Alaska? Why didn't it work as well for other states? How can we measure "how well a model fits"?

Before students complete the remainder of the workbook page, confirm that they were able to successfully compute slope and y-intercept, define and test `f(x)` in Pyret; and evaluate the predictive value of `f(x)`.

Pyret includes a function called `fit-model`. Find this contract in your contracts pages! Like `scatter-plot`, it consumes columns for our labels, our xs and ours ys. However, it __also consumes a function!__ It produces a scatter plot, with the function graphed on top of it.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete the second section ("Fit the Model") in @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income.adoc}.
- Discuss as a class: what does @math{R^2} mean?

@math{R^2} describes the _percentage of the variation in the y-variable that is explained by the x variable_ in our model. In other words, an @math{R^2} value of 0.20 could mean that “20% of the variation in median household income is explained by the percentage of college degrees in a state, according to our linear model”. Better models will explain a higher percentage of that variation!

If the model is a perfect, the @math{R^2} value will be 1.00, meaning 100% of the @math{y}-values can be explained by the @math{x}-values. Of course in the real world, no model is perfect! The @math{R^2} value for no correlation at all is *zero*. If we just drew a horizontal predictor line _in the middle of the data_, it would mean that we expect a median income somewhere in that range but with no connection whatsoever to the percentage of people who finish college.

But sometimes models make predictions that are _even worse than useless_ - they trend in the wrong direction altogether! Did you see any models with a negative @math{R^2} value?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete the third section ("Build a Model through Trial and Error") in @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income.adoc}.
- Discuss as a class: what was the best model you could come up with?

But how do we find the __best__ model? In Statistics, an algorithm called linear regression is used to derive the slope and y-intercept of the best possible model by taking every datapoint into account. Pyret has a function that will do just that, called `lr-plot`.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete the last section ("Build a Model Computationally") in @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income.adoc}.
- Discuss as a class: how close did you come to the optimal model? Did anything about the model surprise you?

[.strategy-box, cols="1a", grid="none", stripes="none"]

@span{.title}{More `lr-plot` material}

If you'd like to have students dig deeper into linear regression, there's an @lesson-link{linear-regression, entire lesson} you can use that spends more time interpreting results and writing about findings. Deeper discussion of @math{R^2} and least-squares regression may be appropriate for older students, or in a dedicated statistics class.
|===

When we interpret a model, we try to make sense of the slope, the axes, the @math{R^2} value, and the real data behind them. In this example, __a model built from Alaska and Alabama predicts that a 1 percent increase in college degrees is associated with a **$5613** increase in median household income. Based on the @math{R^2} value of **-15.63**, this is a pretty terrible model and shouldn't be trusted!__

[.lesson-instruction]
- These models are useless if we can't make sense of them!
- For practice building other relationships in the data, complete @printable-exercise{interpreting-models.adoc}.
- Optional: For more practice, build linear models for **other** relationships in the data! You can use @opt-printable-exercise{model-your-own.adoc}, and write up your findings in the extra space on @printable-exercise{interpreting-models.adoc}.

=== Synthesize

- How could we use scatter plots and linear models to find out if taller NBA players tend to make more three-pointers?
- How could we use them to find out if wealthier people live longer?
- How could we use them to find answers to _other_ questions?
