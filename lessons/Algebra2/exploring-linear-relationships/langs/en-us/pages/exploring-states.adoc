= Exploring the States Dataset

For this page, you'll need to open the @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=10bWYM4rOq_ZshtX6_M-xf-bPbfz61rd1, State Demographics Starter File} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Click "Run" and type `states-table` into the Interactions Area on the right. What happens?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The states table appears, with the same columns as the spreadsheet}}

@n Explore the data by looking at the table and making data displays like pie-charts, histograms, box-and-whisker plots, etc. Then fill in any observations or questions you have in the table below. (You may want to refer back to your Contracts page at the back of the workbook, to remind yourself how to make these displays!)

+c.+ I think that @fitb{25em}{} may be related to @fitb{}{}

@n For each of the relationships you listed, make a scatter plot using those columns. What does each display tell you about the relationship between those two columns?

+a.+ @fitb{}{}
