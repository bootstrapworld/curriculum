== Part 1

In Pyret, make a scatter plot using `year` for the labels _and_ for the labels, and `wage` for the y-axis. Looking at this scatter plot, do the dots form a pattern? If so, there may be a _relationship_ between `wage` and `year`!

@n For each of the relationships below, write the code to make a scatter plot, type it into Pyret, and circle "yes" or "no" about whether you see a pattern that might hint at a relationship.

[cols="3a,6a,^1a"]
|===
| Is `wage` related to `year`?
| `scatter-plot(ca-table, "year", "year", "wage")`
| Yes @hspace{1em} No

| Is `adj-wage` related to `year`?
|
| Yes @hspace{1em} No

| Is `adj-rent` related to `year`?
|
| Yes @hspace{1em} No

| Is `adj-rent` related to `wage`?
|
| Yes @hspace{1em} No

| Is `adj-rent` related to `adj-wage`?
|
| Yes @hspace{1em} No
