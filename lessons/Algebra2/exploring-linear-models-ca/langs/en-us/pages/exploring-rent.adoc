= Exploring the CA Wages and Rent Dataset

Open the @starter-file{alg2-ca-rent} and *Save a Copy* of the file that's just for you. Then click "Run" and type `ca-table` into the Interactions Area on the right to see the dataset.

== Making Sense

@n What columns does this dataset have? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`year`, `wage`, `adj-wage` and `adj-rent`}}

@n What was the minimum hourly wage in 1940? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{$0.45/hr}} In 2000? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{$5.75/hr}}

@n What was the minimum hourly wage in 1940, _after adjusting for inflation?_ @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{$9.41/hr}} In 2000? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{$9.77/hr}}

@n For which year was the minimum wage _closest_ to the wage adjusted for inflation? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{2021}}

@n Why is `wage` so different from `adj-wage`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Adjusting for inflation makes a big difference!}}

@n What code will produce a `scatter-plot` showing the minimum wage _adjusted for inflation_  on the y-axis and year on the x-axis? (use the `year` column for labels) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(scatter-plot ca-table "year" "year" "adj-wage"))}}}

@n What code will produce a `scatter-plot` showing the rent of a 2 bedroom apartment (adjusted for inflation)  on the y-axis and year on the x-axis? (use the `year` column for labels) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(scatter-plot ca-table "year" "year" "adj-rent"))}}}


@n What do you notice about the difference between the two charts you've made? @fitb{} +

@n Why would someone use the _adjusted_ minimum wage instead of the minimum wage? @fitb{}{}

== Defining Rows

_The two lines of code under `# Define some rows` extract rows 0 and 1 from the table, and define them as `data-1940` and `data-1950`._

@n Type `data-1940` into the Interactions Area on the right. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just the Row for 1940}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Underneath the definition of those rows, add a new definition for `data-1970` and click "Run", so that Pyret reads your new definition. Type `data-1970` in the Interactions Area to see if it worked.

@n Add definitions for 1990, 2000, and 2020, then *click "Run"* and test them out in the Interactions Area!

@n Add any additional Notices or Wonderings you have about this dataset to the table at the top.
