= Fit a Model: Adjusted Minimum Wage v. Year

_This page will require you to work with your copy of the @starter-file{alg2-ca-rent} in which you should have already defined `f(x)` based on your work on @printable-exercise{model-wage-v-year-1.adoc}._

@vspace{1ex}

_Type @show{(code '(fit-model ca-table "year" "year" "adj-wage" f))} in the Interactions Area._

@n Find the points for adjusted minimum wage in 1940 and 1950 along the predictor line.

@n What do you Notice?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. The points are both on the line, but they don't seem to be very representative of the group.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line goes down, even though the adjusted wage data seems to go up}}

@n What do you Wonder?

@n In the upper left corner, you'll see that it says "S", followed by a number. What is that number? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~10.900989}}

@n Change the definition of `f` so that the slope is _less steep_ and click "Run". What is the @math{S} value now? @fitb{}{}

@n Change the definition of `f` so that the slope is _positive_ and click "Run". What is the @math{S} value now? @fitb{}{}

@n Change the definition of `f` so that it draws a _horizontal line_ and click "Run". What is the @math{S} value? @fitb{}{}

@n Change the y-intercept so that the horizontal line passes through more of the points. What is the @math{S} value? @fitb{}{}

@n What do you think @math{S} tells us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It measures how well the model fits the data}}
