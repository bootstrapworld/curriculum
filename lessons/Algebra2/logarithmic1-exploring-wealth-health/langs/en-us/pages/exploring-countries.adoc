- *country* - name of the country
- *gdp* - total Gross Domestic Product of the country. GDP is often used to measure the economic health of a country.
- *population* - number of people in the country
- *pc-gdp* - the average GDP _per-person, in US Dollars
- *has-univ-healthcare* - indicates if the country has universal healthcare
- *median-lifespan* - the median life expectancy of people in the country

| *In Pyret, make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `pc-gdp` and `median-lifespan`, and sketch it below.*

@n Do you see a relationship? If so, describe it (e.g. - linear or nonlinear? Strong or weak?)

@n Find the point for Equatorial Guinea, an outlier with `pc-gdp` = 38 and `median-life-expectancy` = 65. Why might this point be so far from the rest?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary - perhaps a war or disease is causing people to die young?}} +

@n Find the point for Japan, another outlier with `pc-gdp` = 43 and `median-life-expectancy` = 85.5. Why might this point be so far from the rest?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary - maybe Japanese people have healthier diets?}} +

@n Are there any countries that stand out? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +

@n Suppose a wealthy country is suffering heavy casualties in a war. Draw a star on the scatter plot, showing where you might expect it to be.
