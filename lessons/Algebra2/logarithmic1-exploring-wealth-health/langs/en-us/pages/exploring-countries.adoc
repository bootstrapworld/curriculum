For this section, you'll need the  @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you. The columns in this dataset are described below:

[cols="5a,6a", grid=none, frame=none, stripes=none]
|===
|
- *country* - name of the country
- *gdp* - total Gross Domestic Product of the country. GDP is often used to measure the economic health of a country.
- *population* - number of people in the country

|
- *pc-gdp* - the average GDP _per-person, in thousands_ of $US
- *has-univ-healthcare* - indicates if the country has universal healthcare
- *median-lifespan* - the median life expectancy of people in the country
|===

[cols=".^14,.^21", frame=none, stripes=none]
|===
| @n Make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `pc-gdp` and `median-lifespan`, and sketch its scatter plot below.

@n Suppose a wealthy country is suffering heavy casualties in a war. Draw a star on the scatter plot, showing where you might expect it to be.

@n Do you think you see a relationship? If so, describe it. Is it linear or nonlinear? Strong or weak?
