== Period-based model: @hspace{2em} @math{f(x) = a \sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}(x - h)) + k}

Periodic models written in terms of the @vocab{Period} (@math{P}), focus on _how much time one complete cycle from one @vocab{peak} or @vocab{valley} to another) takes_. +
*Read the @vocab{periodic} sentence stems below:*

@center{
The earth completes one trip around the sun each: @fitbruby{5em}{_year_}{period}.
@hspace{4em}
A full moon appears roughly every @fitbruby{5em}{_month_}{period}.
}

Periodic models can also be written in terms of their @vocab{frequency} (@math{b})...

== Frequency-based model: @hspace{2em} @math{f(x) = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k}

@vocab{Frequency}-based models focus on _how many completed cycles (from one @vocab{peak} or @vocab{valley} to another) happen in a length of time_.

*Read the @vocab{frequency} sentence stems below:*

@center{
A healthy adult heart beats roughly: @fitbruby{8em}{_60-80x per min_}{frequency}.
@hspace{4em}
Teenagers often check their phones @fitbruby{8em}{_50-100x per day_}{frequency}.

@n _"A Ferris Wheel completes a revolution every 30m."_ Rewrite this sentence in terms of @vocab{frequency}:

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A Ferris Wheel completes two revolutions per hour}}

@link-instructions{Open the Desmos File *Exploring Periodic Functions* to Slide 1: *Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (sine)*. You should see four sliders: @math{k}, @math{h}, @math{P}, and @math{a}. +
