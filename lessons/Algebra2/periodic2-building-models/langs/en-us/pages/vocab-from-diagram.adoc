Based on what you can learn from the diagram, describe each of the terms below in your own words.

@vocab{Peaks} -- @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests})}}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Valleys} -- @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the lowest points on the wave}}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Period} -- @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the length of a complete cycle, from peak-to-peak or valley-to-valley (in radians, this will always be @math{2\pi \div b}).}}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Midline} -- @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a horizontal line that falls halfway between the peaks and the valleys}}

@fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Amplitude} -- @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the distance from a peak or valley to the midline}}
