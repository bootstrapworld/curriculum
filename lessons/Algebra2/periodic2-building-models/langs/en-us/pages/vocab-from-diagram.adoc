= Describing Periodic Functions

== What can we learn from this diagram?

@center{@image{../images/wave-labeled-terms.png, 50%}}

Based on what you can learn from the diagram, describe each of the terms in your own words.

@vocab{Peaks} - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests})}}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Valleys} - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the lowest points on the wave}}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Period} - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the length of a complete cycle, from peak-to-peak or valley-to-valley (in radians, this will always be @math{2\pi \div b}).}}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Midline} - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a horizontal line that falls halfway between the peaks and the valleys}}

@fitb{}{}

@vocab{Amplitude} - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the distance from a peak or valley to the midline}}

@fitb{}{}

== Ferris Wheel Data

Using the vocabulary above and the Ferris Wheel data, fill in the blanks below.

@n The dataset appears to have @vocab{peaks} at (write the @math{(x,y)} coords) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{(15, 205), (45, 205) (75, 205), (105, 205)...}}

@n The dataset appears to have @vocab{valleys} at (write the @math{(x,y)} coords) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{(0, 5), (30, 5), (60, 5), (90, 5)...}}

@n The @vocab{period} of this dataset appears to be @fitb{}{@ifsoln{30 minutes}}

@n The @vocab{midline} of this dataset appears to be @fitb{}{@ifsoln{30 minutes}}

@n The @vocab{amplitude} of this dataset appears to be @fitb{}{@ifsoln{100 feet}}
