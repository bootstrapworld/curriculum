== What can we learn from this diagram?

@center{@image{../images/wave-labeled-terms.png, 50%}}

Based on what you can learn from the diagram, describe each of the terms in your own words.

*Peaks* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests})}}

@fitb{}{}

*Valleys* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the lowest points on the wave}}

@fitb{}{}

*Period* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the length of a complete cycle, from peak-to-peak or valley-to-valley (in radians, this will always be @math{2\pi \div b}).}}

@fitb{}{}

*Midline* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a horizontal line that falls halfway between the peaks and the valleys}}

@fitb{}{}

*Amplitude* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the distance from a peak or valley to the midline}}

@fitb{}{}
