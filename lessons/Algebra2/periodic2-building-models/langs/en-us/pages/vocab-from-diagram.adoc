= Words for Describing Periodic Functions

@center{@image{../images/wave-labeled-terms.png, 75%}}

Based on what you can learn from the diagram, describe what each of the terms means in your own words.

*Peaks* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests})}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*Troughs* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the lowest points on the wave}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*Period* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the length of a complete cycle, from peak-to-peak or trough-to-trough (in radians, this will always be @math{2\pi \div b}).}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*Midline* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a horizontal line that falls halfway between the peaks and the troughs}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

*Amplitude* - @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the distance from a peak or trough to the midline}}
