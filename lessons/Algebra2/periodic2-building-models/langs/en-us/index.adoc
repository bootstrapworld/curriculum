@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. +
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first three slides. _(As the lesson progresses you will be directed to adjust the pacing or sync students to you so that they have access to relevant slides.)_
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

== Periodic Functions
@objective{periodic-situations}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to periodic functions, and they become familiar with the terminology to describe them.

=== Launch
We began by graphing the relationship between the legs of a right triangle and the angle formed based on the time on a clock using the functions @math{A(time)} and @math{B(time)}.

To plot these relationships when the input is @vocab{radians}, instead of hours, we'll use the @math{sine} and @math{cosine} functions. In Pyret (and most calculators) these function names are abbreviated as `sin` and `cos`.

@lesson-instruction{
- One of these functions computes the "x values" from our unit circle (@math{A} on the unit clock). The other computes the y-values (@math{B} on the clock).
- Complete @printable-exercise{periodic1-exploring-rides/pages/converting-angles.adoc} to determine which is which!
- The contracts for these functions are: +
@hspace{4em}
@show{(contracts
'("sin" ("Number") "Number")
'("cos" ("Number") "Number")
)}
}

*Note:* the numbers that these functions expect aren't hours, minutes, pizza slices or degrees. _They consume @vocab{radians}!_

=== Investigate
Periodic models for sin and cos relationships have the basic form:

@center{@math{f(x) = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k} @hspace{1em} **OR** @hspace{1em} @math{g(x) = a \cos(b(x - h)) + k}}

Both @math{sin} and @math{cos} are closely related to one another, and each one can be expressed in terms of the other. We're going to investigate @math{sin} for now, but everything you learn will also apply to @math{cos}.

@QandA{
@Q{Many of the models we've studied had a coefficient added at the end of the definition. Thinking back to what you learned, what effect do you think @math{k} has on a periodic model?}
@A{It's the vertical shift - it moves the midline of the graph up and down the y-axis.}
@Q{What effect do you think each of the _other_ coefficients has on the model?}
@A{Some may recognize @math{h} as the horizontal shift, or @math{a} as some kind of multiplier that makes the peaks higher and the troughs lower}

@teacher{Sync or pace students to __Slide 2: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (sin)__ of @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos}.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Exploring Periodic Models Desmos file* to experiment with the coefficients of periodic models!
- You should now be on *Slide 2: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (sin)*.
- Adjust the sliders to fit this data. How close can you get?
- With your partner or group, complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models-a.adoc}, @printable-exercise{graphing-models-b.adoc}, and @printable-exercise{graphing-models-h.adoc}.
- Then turn to @printable-exercise{vocab-from-diagram.adoc} and
see if you can come up with explanations for what each of the terms on this diagram refer to.

@slidebreak

@teacher{As you debrief, give ample time for students to hear each other's thinking. Concepts like amplitude and frequency can be difficult to describe, and having students reach a consensus on their definition in their own words will help deepen their understanding.}

*Peaks, Troughs and Midline*

When graphed from 0 to @math{2\pi}, periodic functions rise to a certain height above a @vocab{Midline}, then drop the same distance below it, then rise and fall again to complete the cycle. This cycle then repeats over and over.

- @vocab{Peaks} - the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests})
  * _Since periodic functions rise and fall repeatedly, there isn't a maxima, but math books sometimes refer to each peak as a local maxima_
- @vocab{Troughs} - the lowest points on the wave
  * _Since periodic functions rise and fall repeatedly, there isn't a minima, but math books sometimes refer to each trough as a local minima_
- @vocab{Midline} - a horizontal line that falls halfway between the peaks and the troughs

@slidebreak

==== Amplitude @math{a}

The distance from a peak or trough to the @vocab{midline}.

@slidebreak

==== @math{\text{Period} = 2\pi \over \text{frequency}}

The period is the horizontal distance over which the curve travels before it begins to repeat itself (one complete wave).
- It can be measured from peak to peak or from trough to trough.
- The @vocab{frequency} (@math{b}) is _how many cycles_ occur over a @math{2\pi} interval.

|===
|																			| Period 		| Frequency
| When @math{b = 1}															|@math{2\pi} 	| 1
| When the @vocab{period} is cut in half, the @vocab{frequency} _doubles_	|@math{\pi} 	| 2
| When the @vocab{period} doubles, the @vocab{frequency} is _cut in half_	|@math{4\pi}	| @math{1/2}
|===

@slidebreak

==== Horizontal Shift (@math{h})

The @vocab{Horizontal Shift} is also called the @vocab{Phase Shift}.

- When @math{h} < 0, it shifts the graph to the left.
- When @math{h} > 0, it shifts the graph to the right.

_Note: In the function definition @math{f(x) = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k}, when h is positive it looks like it's being subtracted._

==== Vertical shift (@math{k})

The vertical shift is the amount the function is shifted up or down
- When @math{k} < 0, the graph is shifted down.
- When @math{k} > 0, the graph is shifted up.


@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Now that you have a sense for what terms like @vocab{amplitude}, @vocab{frequency}, and @vocab{midline} mean, complete @printable-exercise{matching-periodic-descriptions.adoc} by matching the graphs of periodic functions to their written descriptions.
- What strategies did you use to match the graphs to the descriptions?
}

@slidebreak

@teacher{Sync or pace students to __Slides 2 through 4 of @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos}__.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Exploring Periodic Models Desmos file*.
- You should still be on *Slide 2: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (sin)*.
- With your partner, complete @printable-exercise{modeling-ferris-wheel.adoc}, advancing to *Slide 3: Translating from sin to cos* and *Slide 4: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (cos)*.
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-ferris-wheel}, and change the definitions of `f` and `g` to match the models defined on @printable-exercise{modeling-ferris-wheel.adoc}. How well do they fit?
}

@teacher{
*NOTE:* The altitude column of the Ferris wheel dataset has been rounded to make it easier for students to use. This rounding will result in _some_ error in the model.
}

Suppose you needed to compute the model for a _different_ Ferris Wheel. Would you know how to use the radius and speed of the wheel to compute the model?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{make-a-wheel.adoc} with your partner.
}

=== Synthesize
Periodic relationships involve repeating cycles. Like our Ferris wheel, they rise and fall along regular intervals. Can you come up with some examples of periodic relationships?

@teacher{
This can be a terrific out-of-seats activity:

- Have groups of students go to whiteboards/flipcharts, and write down their periodic relationship (e.g. - phases of the moon, tides, etc).
- Ask them what the period is, then the x-axis, then the y-axis. For example, phases of the moon has a period of roughly 1 month, so the x-axis might be days. For the y-axis, we could use "Percent of visible moon" or "number of lumens".
- Under that description, have them draw axes and their wave!
}

For each one:

- Can you estimate the _period_ of the relationship?
- Can you estimate the _amplitude?_
- Can you estimate the _midline_ and _vertical shift?_

@teacher{
You'll likely need to support students in thinking through what these terms mean in the context of their first example, to get the class started. Suppose a student volunteers "the temperature, because it gets cold in the winter and warm in the summer":

- The seasons change over the course of one year, so the period would be 365 days.
- The temperature in your area might fluctuate between 95° in the summer and 25° F in the winter. That's a range of 70° F, for an amplitude of 35° F.
- The @vocab{midline} and the vertical shift are at 60° F (25 + 35 = 60).
