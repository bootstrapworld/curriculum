- Decide whether or not you want to print and distribute copies of @opt-printable-exercise{vocab-from-ferris-wheel.adoc}.
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. +
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first slide. _(As the lesson progresses you will be directed to adjust the pacing so that students have access to relevant slides.)_

== Describing Periodic Models
@objective{periodic-situations}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the basic form of sine and cosine functions, and become familiar with the terminology to describe them.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{vocab-from-diagram.adoc} using what you can learn from the diagram to come up with explanations for each of the terms.
- Be ready to share your definitions with the class!

*The power of student ownership*

Solicit a few definitions for each term from different students, always looking for definitions are different from those that have been shared before. (Of course, be sure to correct any incorrect definitions!)

The goal is to have students take ownership, hear one another, and realize that others may have understood things in a different way or made different connections.
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

- @vocab{Peaks} -- the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests})
- @vocab{Valleys} -- the lowest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Troughs})
- @vocab{Midline} -- a line (or curve!) that is always halfway between the @vocab{peaks} and the @vocab{valleys}
- @vocab{Amplitude} -- the distance from a peak or valley to the @vocab{midline}
- @vocab{Period} -- the distance over which the curve travels before it begins to repeat itself (one complete wave)

NOTE: _Since periodic functions rise and fall repeatedly, there isn't a single maxima or minima, but math books sometimes refer to each peak and valley as a "local maxima" or "local minima"_

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate-DN}

@teacher{Make sure you have created a link or code for your class to @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos} and paced the class so they have access to __Slide 1: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (sine)__.

Note: The desmos slider activity in this lesson sections uses *Sine* as the model. The second section of this lesson introduces the idea that we can use either sine or cosine to model periodic functions and includes other slider activities through which students will explore how they are related.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- We are about to explore the model settings in the @vocab{sine} model for periodic relationships: @hspace{1em} @math{f(x) = a \sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}(x - h)) + k}
- Take a moment to think back to other models we've seen and predict what effect each of the model settings will have on the shape of this model.
}

@teacher{
Some students may recognize @math{k} as the vertical shift, @math{h} as the horizontal shift, or @math{a} as some kind of multiplier that makes the peaks higher and the valleys lower. The point here is just to encourage them to think about what patterns they've already seen. We are about to experiment with Desmos sliders to investigate how each of these model settings influences the shape of the model.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the *Desmos* link I've shared with you. (The file should be called *Exploring Periodic Models*.)
- You should now be on *Slide 1: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (sine)*.
- Adjust the sliders to fit this data. How close can you get?
- With your partner or group, experiment with the model settings of periodic models to complete these three pages:
  * @printable-exercise{graphing-models-a.adoc}
  * @printable-exercise{graphing-models-h.adoc}
  * @printable-exercise{graphing-models-p.adoc}

- Rather than focusing on _how long it takes_ for the ride to complete one cycle, we can think about _how many cycles the ride completes_ in 30 minutes. Click the red circle to "hide" the function @math{f}, and the empty circle to "show" the function @math{g}.
  * @printable-exercise{graphing-models-b.adoc}
}

@teacher{As you debrief, give plenty of time for students to hear each other's thinking! Concepts like amplitude and frequency can be difficult to describe, and having students reach a consensus on their definition in their own words will help deepen their understanding.}

==== Period

The distance over which the curve travels before it begins to repeat itself (one complete wave). It can be measured from peak to peak, from valley to valley, or from any start point to an identical end point after passing through both a peak and a valley.

@QandA{
@Q{Why did the graph of our function *disappear* when the @vocab{period} was zero?}
@A{Mathematically, a fraction with a denominator of zero is undefined, which means a periodic function with @math{P = 0} is also undefined.}
@A{Periodic functions involving time -- by definition -- are cycled over some number of minutes, hours, days, etc. A @vocab{period} of zero means the function never repeats at all, which would make it *not a periodic function.*}

The number of @vocab{periods} that occur over a @math{2\pi} interval. @hspace{1em} @big{@math{\text{Frequency} = {2\pi \over \text{Period}}}}

@vspace{2ex}
}

==== Horizontal Shift (@math{h})

In periodic functions, the @vocab{Horizontal Shift} is sometimes called the @vocab{Phase Shift}.

- When @math{h} < 0, the graph shifts to the left.
- When @math{h} > 0, the graph shifts to the right.

_Note: In the function definition @math{f(x) = a \sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}(x - h)) + k}, when h is positive it looks like it's being subtracted._

==== Vertical shift (@math{k})

The @vocab{vertical shift} is the amount the function is shifted up or down.

- When @math{k} < 0, the graph shifts down.
- When @math{k} > 0, the graph shifts up.

@strategy{Why start with Period instead of Frequency?}{

While most math textbooks introduce the parent sine and cosine functions using @math{b} instead of @math{P}, we've consciously chosen to do the opposite for pedagogical reasons. Frequency is a much more abstract concept, and the calculation with @math{\pi} also makes for "messy" numbers with long decimals that are more difficult to work with. Even strong students who are comfortable calculating with numbers like these may lean on their calculation skill to get answers, without being challenged to connect the math back to common sense.

In the Ferris Wheel example, it's easy for students to see where the 30m period fit into the equation. By building the concrete connections with @math{P} first and then transitioning to the more abstract @math{b}, the parent function becomes more accessible to struggling learners while deepening the advanced students' understanding.

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

- What similarities and differences do you observes between periodic functions and other kinds of functions we've seen?

== Connecting Sine and Cosine

=== Overview
Students dig deeper into the _vocabulary_ for periodic functions, starting with their own words and gradually moving to a more formal understanding. They apply this understanding by returning to the Ferris wheel problem from the @lesson-link{periodic1-exploring-rides} lesson.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}
[cols="2a,1a", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| We've been working with @vocab{sine} models for @vocab{periodic relationships}: 
| @big{@math{f(x) = a \sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}(x - h)) + k}}

| Another commonly used periodic model is the @vocab{cosine} relationship: 
| @big{@math{f(x) = a \cos(\frac{2\pi}{P}(x - h)) + k}}
|===

Sine and Cosine relationships are closely related to one another, and each one can be expressed in terms of the other.

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Launch-DN}


@teacher{Pace students to __Slides 1 through 3 of @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos}__.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Exploring Periodic Models Desmos file*.
- With your partner, complete @printable-exercise{modeling-ferris-wheel.adoc}.
  * For the first section you should still be on *Slide 1: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (sine)*.
  * For the second section you'll advance to *Slide 2: Translating from sine to cosine*.
  * For the third section you'll advance to *Slide 3: Modeling the Ferris Wheel Dataset (cosine)*.
- When you finish the page, open the @starter-file{alg2-ferris-wheel}, and change the definitions of `f` and `g` to match the models defined on @printable-exercise{modeling-ferris-wheel.adoc}. How well do they fit?
}

@teacher{
*NOTE:* The altitude column of the Ferris wheel dataset has been rounded to make it easier for students to use. This rounding will result in _some_ error in the model.
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

Suppose you needed to compute the model for a _different_ Ferris wheel. Would you know how to use the radius and speed of the wheel to compute the model?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{make-a-wheel.adoc} with your partner.
}

=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}
Periodic relationships involve repeating cycles. Like our Ferris wheel, they rise and fall along regular intervals.

@QandA{
@Q{Can you come up with some examples of periodic relationships?}
@Q{For each one, can you estimate
* the @vocab{period} of the relationship?
* the @vocab{amplitude}?
* the @vocab{midline} and @vocab{vertical shift}?
}
}

@teacher{
You'll likely need to support students in thinking through what these terms mean in the context of their first example, to get the class started.

- Suppose a student volunteers "the temperature, because it gets cold in the winter and warm in the summer":
  * The seasons change over the course of one year, so the period would be 365 days.
  * The temperature in your area might fluctuate between 95° in the summer and 25° F in the winter. That's a range of 70° F, for an amplitude of 35° F.
  * The midline and the vertical shift are at 60° F (25 + 35 = 60).
- Other ideas might include tides, phases of the moon, hours of daylight over the course of the year, etc.
}

@ifnotslide{
@strategy{Optional: Out-of-Seats Activity}{

- Have groups of students go to whiteboards/flipcharts, and write down the periodic relationship they came up with.
- Beneath the description, have them draw axes and their wave!
- Ask them what the period is, then the x-axis, then the y-axis.
  * e.g. Phases of the moon:
  *** Period is roughly 1 month.
  *** The x-axis might be days.
  *** For the y-axis, we might use "Percent of visible moon" or "number of lumens".
