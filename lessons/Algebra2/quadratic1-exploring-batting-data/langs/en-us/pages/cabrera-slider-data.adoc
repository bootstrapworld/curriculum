You'll need @starter-file{alg2-miguel-cabrera} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you. *For this page we will be focusing on just the sliders, so make sure you are writing code using `sliders-table`*

== Fitting Linear Models

@n Use @show{(code '(lr-plot sliders-table "id" "hit-angle" "hit-distance"))} to find the optimal *linear* model. +
What is @math{S} for this model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~77.35}}

Write the model below, in both math and Pyret notation.

@center{
 @math{y =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{@math{2.76394}}}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{201.599}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (y x) (+ (* (?ANS 2.76394) x) (?ANS 201.599))))}
}

@n Sketch the linear model from your `lr-plot` below!

@n Is the best-possible linear model a good fit? Why or why not?

@blanklines{2}{
@ifsoln{No. The S-value predicts an error of ~77 feet (a lot for a range of 75 to 440 feet) and the model does not follow the shape of the data}
}

== Fitting Curves

[.FillVerticalSpace, cols="1a,1a", options="frame"]

@n Draw a *curve* on the scatter-plot, which shows the overall shape in the data.

@ifnotsoln{@center{@image{../images/cabrera-sliders-angle-distance.png, 425}}}

@n How would you describe the pattern? @fitb{}{} +
@blanklines{4}{
@ifsoln{hit distance generally increases as his hit angle increases from 0 to 30 degrees. As the angle increases after that, his hit distance generally _decreases!_}
}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At what `hit-angle` is the curve's "peak"? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 30 degrees}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Based on your best-guess curve, predict the `hit-distance` for new hits at each `hit-angle` below.

- 15 degrees: @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~275}}
- 35 degrees: @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~375}}
- 50 degrees: @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~225}}
