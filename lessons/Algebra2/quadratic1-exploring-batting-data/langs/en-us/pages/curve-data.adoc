== Fitting Linear Models

@n Use @show{(code '(lr-plot curve-table "id" "bat-angle" "hit-distance"))} to find the optimal *linear* model. +
What is @math{S} for this model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.93}}

Write the model below, in both math and Pyret notation.

@center{
 @math{y =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{@math{-0.01017}}}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{29.9459}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (y x) (+ (* (?ANS -0.01017) x) (?ANS 29.9459))))}
}

@n Sketch the linear model from your `lr-plot` below!

@n Is the best-possible linear model a good fit? Why or why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. The S-value predicts an error of ~104 feet (a lot for a range of 50}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{ to 400 feet) and the model does not follow the shape of the data}}

== Fitting Curves

[.FillVerticalSpace, cols="1a,1a", options="frame"]

@n Draw a *curve* on the scatter-plot, which shows the overall shape in the data.

@ifnotsoln{@center{@image{../images/curve-angle-distance.png, 425}}}

@scrub{REPLACE THIS ONCE LR PLOT ISN'T USING SCI NOTATION}

@n How would you describe the pattern? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{hit distance generally increases}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{as his bat angle increases from 0 to 30 degrees.}}
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As the angle increases after that,}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{his hit distance generally _decreases!}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At what `bat-angle` is the curve's "peak"? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{about 30 degrees}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Based on your best-guess curve, predict the `hit-distance` for new hits at each `bat-angle` below.

- 15 degrees: @fitb{5em}{}
- 35 degrees: @fitb{5em}{}
- 50 degrees: @fitb{5em}{}
