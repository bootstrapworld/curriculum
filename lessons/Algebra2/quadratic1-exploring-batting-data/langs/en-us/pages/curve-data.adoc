For this page, you'll need to open the @starter-file{alg2-aaron-judge} on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

For this page we will be focusing on just the curve balls, so make sure you are writing code using `curve-table`

== Fitting Linear Models

@n Use @show{(code '(lr-plot curve-table "id" "bat-hangle" "hit-distance"))} to find the optimal *linear* model. What is @math{S} for this model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.93}}

Write the model below, in both math and Pyret notation.

@center{
 @math{y =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{@math{-0.01017}}}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{29.9459}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (y x) (+ (* (?ANS -0.01017) x) (?ANS 29.9459))))}
}

@n Is the best-possible linear model a good fit? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{No}}. Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No - the S-value is off by almost ----, and the model does not follow the shape of the data}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Sketch your lr-plot in the space below, showing the relationship between `bat-angle` and `hit-distance`. Be sure to label your axes, and draw the linear model!

@n Do you think a *curve* would fit better? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{yes}}

|===

@n Draw a *curve* on your scatter-plot, which shows the overall shape in the data. At what angle is the "peak"? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{30 degrees}}

@n Based on your best-guess curve, what do you predict `hit-distance` would be for a new hit at a bat angle of 15 degrees @fitb{2em}{}? 40 degrees @fitb{2em}{}?
