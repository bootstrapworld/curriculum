For this page, you'll need to open the @starter-file{alg2-aaron-judge} on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you. *Read the comments at the top of the file*, which describe what each column in the dataset means.

@n What is the name of the table being loaded in this file? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`judge-table`}}

== Looking for Possible Relationships

We can look for potential relationships between quantitative columns by building scatter plots. Let's see what they reveal.


@n Make a scatter plot comparing
@fitbruby{15em}{pitch speed}{explanatory variable} and
@fitbruby{15em}{hit speed}{response variable}.

@indented{
- Does there appear to be a relationship between `pitch-speed` and `hit-speed`? If so, describe it. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@fitb{}{}

- Based on the scatter plot, for a ball pitched at a speed of 95mph, what speed would you predict it to be hit at?

@fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{65 - 120 mph}}

Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{most of Judge's hits are between 65 and 120 mph}}
}


@n Make a scatter plot comparing
@fitbruby{15em}{pitch speed}{explanatory variable} and
@fitbruby{15em}{hit distance}{response variable}.

@indented{
- Does there appear to be a relationship between `pitch-speed` and `hit-speed`? If so, describe it. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@fitb{}{}

- Based on the scatter plot, for a ball pitched at a speed of 95mph, what speed would you predict it to be hit at?

@fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{50 - 450 feet}}

Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Most of Judge's hits are between 50 and 450 feet.}}
}


@n Make a scatter plot comparing
@fitbruby{15em}{bat angle}{explanatory variable} and
@fitbruby{15em}{hit distance}{response variable}.

@indented{
- Does there appear to be a relationship between `bat-angle` and `hit-distance`? If so, describe it.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. There seems to be an optimum bat angle.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The hit distamce seems to increase as the angle increases up to a point. After that it decreases as the angle increases.}

- Based on the scatter plot, what distance would you predict for a ball hit at an angle of 60 degrees?

@fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{about 175 feet}}

Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the other balls batted at 60 degrees traveled 150 to 200 ft.}}
}


@n Make a scatter plot comparing
@fitbruby{15em}{bat angle}{explanatory variable} and
@fitbruby{15em}{hit speed}{response variable}.

@indented{
- Does there appear to be a relationship between `bat-angle` and `hit-speed`? If so, describe it.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

- Based on the scatter plot, what speed would you predict for a ball hit at an angle of 20 degrees?

@fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{70 - 120mph}}

Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Judge's hit speed seems to be fairly evenly distributed in that range.}}
