For this page, you'll need to open the @starter-file{alg2-aaron-judge} on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you. *Read the comments at the top of the file*, which describe what each column in the dataset means.

@n What is the name of the table being loaded in this file? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`judge-table`}}

== Looking for Possible Relationships

We can look for potential relationships between quantitative columns by building scatter plots. Let's see what they reveal.


@n Make a scatter plot comparing
@fitbruby{15em}{pitch speed}{explanatory variable} and
@fitbruby{15em}{hit speed}{response variable}.

@indented{
- Does there appear to be a relationship between `pitch-speed` and `hit-speed`? If so, describe it. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@fitb{}{}

- Based on the scatter plot, what hit speed would you predict for a ball pitched at 95mph? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{65 - 120 mph}}
  * Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{most of Judge's hits are between 65 and 120 mph}}
- How confident are you in your prediction? @hspace{1em} _NOT AT ALL_ @hspace{1em} 1 @hspace{1em} 2 @hspace{1em} 3 @hspace{1em} 4 @hspace{1em} 5 @hspace{1em} 6 @hspace{1em} 7 @hspace{1em} 8 @hspace{1em} 9 @hspace{1em} 10 @hspace{1em} _VERY_
}


@n Make a scatter plot comparing
@fitbruby{15em}{pitch speed}{explanatory variable} and
@fitbruby{15em}{hit distance}{response variable}.

@indented{
- Does there appear to be a relationship between `pitch-speed` and `hit-distance`? If so, describe it. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No.}}

@fitb{}{}

- Based on the scatter plot, what hit distance would you predict for a ball pitched at 95mph? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{50 - 450 feet}}
  * Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Most of Judge's hits are between 50 and 450 feet.}}

@n Make a scatter plot comparing
@fitbruby{15em}{bat angle}{explanatory variable} and
@fitbruby{15em}{hit distance}{response variable}.

@indented{
- Does there appear to be a relationship between `bat-angle` and `hit-distance`? If so, describe it. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. There seems to be}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{an optimum bat angle. The hit distances increase as the angle increases up to a point. Above about 30 degrees the hit distances decrease.}}

- Based on the scatter plot, what distance would you predict for a ball hit at an angle of 60 degrees? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{about 175 feet}}

  * Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{as the bat angle increases to 60 degrees, the hit distance drops to between 150 and 200 ft.}}
- How confident are you in your prediction? @hspace{1em} _NOT AT ALL_ @hspace{1em} 1 @hspace{1em} 2 @hspace{1em} 3 @hspace{1em} 4 @hspace{1em} 5 @hspace{1em} 6 @hspace{1em} 7 @hspace{1em} 8 @hspace{1em} 9 @hspace{1em} 10 @hspace{1em} _VERY_
