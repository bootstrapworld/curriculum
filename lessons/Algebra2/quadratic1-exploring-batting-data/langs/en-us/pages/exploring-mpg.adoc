For this page, you'll need to open the @opt-starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency} on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you. *Read the comments at the top of the file*, which describe what each column in the dataset means.

== Fitting Linear Models

@n Evaluate `A15`, `A45` and `A75` in the Interactions Area. What *model* of car is used in all three rows? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`A`}}

@n At what three *speeds* is this model being tested in these rows? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{15, 45 and 75 miles per gallon}}

@n Does there appear to be a relationship between speed and miles-per-gallon? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Yes}}.

@n _Looking at the numbers in the_ `mpg-table`, describe its *form* (e.g. - linear, non-linear, or none) and *strength* (strong, moderate, or weak). +
If it appears to be linear, what is the *direction*? If it does _not_ appear to be linear, describe its shape.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There seems to be a moderate/strong, nonlinear correlation. It looks like a parabola that opens down, with a dimple at the top.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Use @show{(code '(lr-plot mpg-table "model" "speed" "mpg"))} to find the optimal *linear* model. What is @math{S} for this model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.93}}

Write the model below, in both math and Pyret notation.

@center{
 @math{y =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{@math{-0.01017}}}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{29.9459}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (y x) (+ (* (?ANS -0.01017) x) (?ANS 29.9459))))}
}

@n Is the best-possible linear model a good fit? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{No}}. Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No - the S-value is off by almost 3 mpg, and the model does not follow the shape of the data}}

== Fitting Curves

@n Sketch your lr-plot in the space below, showing the relationship between `speed` and `mpg`. Be sure to label your axes, and draw the linear model!

@n Do you think a *curve* would fit better? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{yes}}

|===

@n Draw a *curve* on your scatter-plot, which shows the overall shape in the data. At what speed is the "peak"? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{45-55mpg}}

@n Based on your best-guess curve, what do you predict `mpg` would be for a new test run at 25mph @fitb{2em}{}? 60mph @fitb{2em}{}? 90mph @fitb{2em}{}?
