== Exploring the Data
@objective{model-explore}

=== Overview
Students explore the @starter-file{alg2-aaron-judge}, and create scatter plots to search for relationships between columns. They share and discuss their findings with the class, discovering the limitations of linear models.

=== Launch

@teacher{These questions are intended to spark student interest in the dataset they are about to explore.}

@QandA{
@right{@image{images/aaron-judge.jpeg, 200}}Aaron Judge is an American professional baseball outfielder for the New York Yankees. In 2022 he hit 62 home runs, setting the  American League record for most home runs in a season.
@Q{What is a home run?}
@A{When a batter makes it around all of the bases and back to home plate before the other team is able to gain control of the ball and stop them.}
@Q{What factors might influence how many home runs a player hits in a season?}
@A{Possible responses:}
@A{How fast the batter runs.}
@A{How strong the batter is.}
@A{The speed and angle at which the batter swings the bat.}
@A{How calm and focused the player is when they are at bat, perhaps influenced by personality, sleep, diet, stretching, meditation, etc.}
@A{How many hits make it into the bleachers, so they are inaccessible to the outfielders.}
@A{How fans and teammates support the batter.}
@A{How big the fields are where the practice and play - in some stadiums (like Boston's Fenway Park) a hit of 302 feet will make it past the outfield. Some stadiums have distances exceeding 400 feet to center field.}
}

@slidebreak

In this lesson, we'll explore possible relationships between pitch (type and speed), bat angle, and hit (distance, speed and ball type) in a dataset of Aaron Judge's hits in 2016 and 2017.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-aaron-judge}.
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{exploring-judge-data.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{Which quantitative columns appear to have the strongest relationship?}
@A{bat-angle and hit-distance}
@Q{Would you describe the relationship as linear? Why?}
@A{No. Because it's u-shaped, rather than a straight line.}

}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What is happening on lines 21-36 of the Definitions Area?}
@A{Four filtered tables are being defined, focused on subsets of the data for specific hit types}
@Q{How would we make a scatter plot comparing `bat-angle` and `hit-distance` for just the curve balls?}
@A{Exactly like the scatter plots we just made, except we'd use `curve-table` instead of `judge-table`}
@A{`scatter-plot(curve-table, "id", "bat-angle", "hist-distance")`}
@Q{Take a moment to make scatter plots comparing `bat-angle` and `hit-distance` for each of the filtered tables defined in the starter file. How do they compare?
}
@A{They all more or less make an upside down U shape, but they look slightly different and have a different numbers of points.}
}

=== Investigate

Let's focus on just the curve balls for now.  There definitely appears to be a relationship here...
@center{@image{images/curve-angle-distance.png,400}}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{curve-data.adoc}.
- Complete the first section to find the optimal linear model and see how well it predicts hit distances from bat angles.
}

@QandA{
@Q{Is the best-possible linear model a good fit? Why or why not?}
@A{No. The model does not follow the shape of the data!}
@Q{Use the @math{S}-value to describe the fit of the model.}
@A{The @math{S}-value predicts an error of almost 104 feet for hit distances that only range between 50 and 400 feet!}
}

@slidebreak

Linear models don't seem to fit very well! No matter which direction we draw the line, many of the points are far away - and they will make poor predictions for a large subset of x-values.

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to the *Fitting Curves* section of @printable-exercise{curve-data.adoc}.
- Drawing and describe the pattern you actually see. Then use it to make some predictions.
- Discuss your thinking with your partner.
}

@slidebreak
@QandA{
@Q{How would you describe the pattern you see here?}
@A{Aaron Judge's hit distance generally increases as his bat angle increases from 0 to 30 degrees. As the angle increases after that, his hit distance generally _decreases!_}
}

@teacher{Review student answers to confirm that students see a _nonlinear_ relationship in the dataset that is fairly strong. Students should generally agree that the relationship is better fit by a curve, with hit distance peaking at a bat angle of _roughly_ 30 degrees.  *Make sure students have agreed on this vertex*, as its location is important for the next activity!

Have students share their "curves of best fit", encouraging them to identify where they "peak" and where they cross the x-axis. These locations will be important anchor concepts on which to build in the next section. (One option for facilitating sharing is to project the scatter plot on a whiteboard and have students come up and draw all of their curves on it).
}

=== Synthesize

- Why don't linear models work to model the relationship between bat angle and hit distance?
- What kinds of curves did you draw that fit better?

== Quadratic Relationships
@objective{quadratic-situations}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to quadratic functions. They become familiar with scenarios involving quadratics learn how to identify quadratic sequences.

=== Launch
Linear models work well for fitting simple relationships, but many relationships in the real world are far more complex! +
_Straight-line, linear models are often too primitive_.

The relationship we observe between bat angle and hit distance appears to best be described by a _curve_, where hit distance increases up to a certain bat angle, and then decreases again. This is definitely not linear! There are many kinds of non-linear relationships. The first one we'll learn about is called a @vocab{quadratic relationship}.

@slidebreak

Graphs of @vocab{quadratic relationships} are often described as "u-shaped" or "looking like an arch". More formally, mathematicians and data scientists call these kinds of curves @vocab{parabolas}. There are lots of relationships that change direction like this!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-descriptions.adoc} and practice identifying which scenarios are likely best modeled by linear relationships and which are likely best modeled by quadratic relationships.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What characteristics did you look for to identify whether a scenario was likely best-modeled by a linear or quadratic relationship?}
@A{When there's either a steady increase or a steady decrease, a linear model will likely fit.}
@A{When there's a high point or a low point at which the change changes direction, a quadratic model will likely be a good fit.}
}


=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Brainstorm some other real-world relationships that could likely be modeled by a quadratic function.}
@A{Answers will vary.}
@A{Many nutrients are good for you, and the more you take the healthier you are...up to a point. After that, too much of a mineral or vitamin can cause problems. A graph of @math{\text{health}(\text{dose})} will be quadratic.}
@A{When an athlete is young, they improve as they get stronger and more skilled. But as they age, they begin to lose their speed and strength.A graph of @math{\text{height}(\text{time})} will be quadratic.}
@A{The temperature of a puddle will warm and then cool over the course of the day. A graph of @math{\text{temp}(\text{time})} will be quadratic.}
@A{A ball dropped from a tall building will get faster and faster as it falls, so a graph of @math{\text{distance}(\text{time})} will be quadratic.}
}


== Additional Practice

- The @opt-printable-exercise{exploring-mpg.adoc} engages students in exploring the @opt-starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency}. 
  * Thinking for this page parallels @printable-exercise{curve-data.adoc}
  * For students who aren't baseball fans, a chance to practice what they've learned in another context may be welcome.

@teacher{
*NOTE*: While the fuel efficiency dataset used in the optional materials we'll be offering throughout our quadratics lessons is based on real data obtained from the @link{https://tedb.ornl.gov/, Transportation Energy Book}, *it has been augmented with fictional data* in order to provide a sufficiently-rich dataset for student modeling. You can find out more about this augmentation in the README tab of @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SLm1hDkVgAYxgh12dTD2Z3GXCUO9PrbwIZdqu9FiCGI/edit?gid=0#gid=0, the dataset}.
