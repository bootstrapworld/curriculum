@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on the same custom-built interactive Desmos activity we introduced in @lesson-link{exponential1-exploring-covid}.
 * Set the pacing so that students are synced to you and only able to interact with the slide for the lesson section you are working on.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * If you don't already have a code, or you want to share a new one, you will first want to:
 *** Open @starter-file{alg2-covid-desmos}.
 *** Make a link or code to share with your students.
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do.}_

== Why Just One State at a Time?
@objective{model-simpsons}

=== Overview
Students discuss an example of Simpson's Paradox, which motivates splitting a dataset into grouped samples using filters. They then discover another motivation for filtering: scatter plots like our covid dataset show _multiple_ @vocab{correlations}, instead of just one. Finally, they learn how to filter a dataset and apply that knowledge to filtering the Covid dataset into samples grouped by state.

=== Launch


@teacher{
@opt{The first table and accompanying questions below can be @printable-exercise{simpsons-data.adoc, printed here}, if that would work better for your students.}
}

A college is looking at enrollment and housing data for students who've decided what their major will be, vs. those who are undecided:

@indented{
[cols="3a,^2a,^2a,^3a", options="header", width="80%"]
|===
|             | # On Campus   | # Off Campus  | % On Campus
| Undecided   | 120           |  80           |  120/200 = 60%
| Decided     |  80           | 100           |   80/180 = 44%
|===
}

@QandA{
@Q{According to the table, how many Undecided Majors live _off_-campus?}
@A{80}
@Q{How many Decided Majors live _on_-campus?}
@A{80}
@Q{*Who is more likely to live on campus: Decided or Undecided Majors?*}
@A{(Give students time to talk about this, and explain their thinking!  )}
}

@slidebreak

It _looks_ like the two variables are significantly related: undecided majors are more likely to live on campus than decided ones!

But there's a *third variable hiding in the background*: freshmen college students are far less likely to have picked a major than seniors, _and_ they are much more likely to live on campus.

@slidebreak

When we filter by this important third variable, it turns out that for both Freshmen and Non-Freshmen, there is _no correlation_ between between deciding on a major and living on- or off-campus.

[cols="^1a,^1a", strips="none", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^2a", options="header"]
!===
! *Freshmen*     ! # On Campus     ! # Off Campus  ! % On Campus
! Undecided      ! 100             ! 20            ! 100/120 = 83%
! Decided        !  50             ! 10            !  50/60  = 83%
!===

! Undecided      !  20             ! 60            !  20/80 = 25%
! Decided        !  30             ! 90            !  30/120 = 25%
!===

What _looks_ like a correlation between having-a-major and living-on-campus is actually a correlation between _age_ and living-on-campus.

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/Simpsons_animation.gif, 300}}
A third variable lurking in the data can play tricks by obscuring relationships between two other variables - or by creating the appearance of a relationship where none exists!

We often think that the more data we include in our sample the more clearly we'll see any potential relationships. But, in certain circumstances, the correlations in our sub-groups cancel each other out when we put the groups together. This is called @link{https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox, Simpson's Paradox.}

@lesson-point{
Simpson's Paradox: visible trends in sub-groups _disappear_ or even _reverse_ when the groups are combined.
}

=== Investigate

Sometimes filtering the data into subsets is the only way to see what's really going on. In our @starter-file{alg2-covid}, the subgroups had such strong relationships that the scatter plot for all our New England states does't look much like a scatter plot at all - it looks like someone took a marker and drew in five different curvy lines!

@QandA{
@Q{How is a grouped sample different from a random sample?}
@A{A grouped sample is a non-random subset chosen from a larger set. Grouped samples are non-random by design!}
@Q{What variable(s) might be lurking in the background of the Covid Spread Data, that could be responsible for the distinct curves for each state?}
@A{Give students time to discuss!}
@A{Diseases spread more rapidly in densely-populated areas, since it's easier for the infection to jump from one person to another. Unfortunately, we can't _see_ the density data in our table, so that dimension is missing from our dataset! This is exactly what happened in our college example: we couldn't see the age of the students, which skewed our interpretation of the scatter plot.}
}

@slidebreak

@teacher{Make sure you've advanced your teacher dashboard of @starter-file{alg2-covid-desmos} to the fifth slide ("Exponential Model for VT") so that students will be looking at the correct screen when they are directed to return to Desmos part way through @printable-exercise{modeling-other-states.adoc}}

Now that we've explored the Massachusetts data, we are ready to explore some of the other subsets.

@lesson-instruction{
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete the first section of @printable-exercise{modeling-other-states.adoc} using the @starter-file{alg2-covid}.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What are `is-MA` and `MA-table` doing?}
@A{`is-MA` is a helper function that is used to check  every Row of the Table, producing true if it's from Massachusetts or false if it's not from Massachusetts.}
@A{`MA-table` uses the `filter` function to make a new table, using all the Rows from the original table for which the helper function produced true.}
}

@teacher{
@opt{While filtering is introduced in this lesson, the primary goal is for students to explore exponential functions. If your students need more practice with filtering - or wish to filter their own datasets - we recommend checking out the @lesson-link{filtering-and-building} lesson.}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{modeling-other-states.adoc}.
- You will need both the @starter-file{alg2-covid} and Slide 5 of the *Modeling Covid Spread Desmos file*.
}

=== Common Misconceptions
It's extremely common for students to think that filtering a table _changes the original table_. This is NOT how it works in Pyret! Instead, the `filter` function always produces a _new_ table, containing only the Rows for which the supplied function evaluates to `true`.

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{In what other situations would it be useful to filter a dataset?}
@Q{Can you think of other examples where Simpson's Paradox might arise?}
@A{When comparing one country's schools to another's, a researcher finds that students living in poverty in country A outperform students living in poverty in country B. They also find that the wealthy students in A outperform their wealthy peers in B. In fact, for every income level, country A outperforms country B! But if country B has less child poverty overall, it will still outperform A.}
