@link-instructions{
For this page, you'll need to have the @starter-file{alg2-covid} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.
}

@vspace{1ex}

*Find the definition of `is-MI` in your starter file.* The code is shown here:
```
# is-MI :: Row -> Boolean
# consumes a Row, and checks if state == "MI"
fun is-MI(r): r["state"] == "MI" end
```

@n Under the definition of `is-MA`, define a _new_ function called `is-VT`, which tests to see if the `state` value is equal to "VT." Click run and try it out!

@vspace{1ex}

*Find the definition of `MI-table` in your starter file.* The code is shown here:
```
######################################################### 
# Define some grouped and/or random samples
MI-table = filter(covid-table, is-MI)
```

@n Under the definition of `MI-table`, define a _new_ grouped sample called `CA-table` containing all the rows for the state of California. Click run and try it out!

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the best-possible linear model for the relationship between `day` and `positive` in the `CA-table`, then fill in the blanks below:

@indented{
The optimized linear model for this dataset predicts an @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} of about @fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{21}}{slope} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} per @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{day}}{x-variable}. +
The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{826}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{units}. @hspace{1em} I
@fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{disagree}}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit considering that @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from
@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{1092}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{6781}}{highest y-value}.}

== Exponential Model for California (CA)
@link-instructions{
For this section, in addition to Pyret, open *Slide 5: Exponential Model for CA* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)*.
}


@n Turn to *Slide 5: Exponential Model for CA* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* and adjust the sliders until you've come up with the best exponential model you can for the California dataset. Record your model below: +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{*Answers will vary.*
}}

@n Return to @starter-file{alg2-covid}. At the bottom of the Definitions Area, define `exponential-CA` to be the model you just found.

@vspace{1ex}

Click "Run" to load your definition, then fit the model using `CA-table`.

@indented{
According to this model, on January 15th, 2020 there were about
@fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{   }}{a}@fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{   }}{b}@math{^x} + @fitbruby{2em}{@ifsoln{    }}{k} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{positive COVID cases}}{y-units} in CA, for a total of about
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{   }}{a + k}. This number grew exponentially, increasing by a factor of
@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{   }}{Growth Factor: b}, or @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{   }}{Growth Rate: (b − 1) &times; 100}% every day. +
The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about
@fitbruby{2em}{@ifsoln{   }}{S}@fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{positive COVID cases}}{units}. +
I
@fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{   }}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit considering that
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-units} in this dataset range from 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{   }}{lowest y-value} to
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{   }}{highest y-value}.
