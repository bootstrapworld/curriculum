For this page, you'll need to have the @starter-file{alg2-covid} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Find the function called `is-MA` in the Definitions Area under "Define some helper functions" and read the comments carefully!

@indented{
a. What is the Domain of `is-MA`? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{Row}} What is its Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}

b. What do you _think_ @show{(code '(is-MA MA1))} will evalute to? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{true}}. @show{(code '(is-MA CT1))}? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{false}}. @show{(code '(is-MA ME1))}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{false}}

_Try typing each of the `is-MA` expressions from *b* into the Interactions Area on the right and confirm that you were correct._
}

@n Find `MA-table` in the Definitions Area under "Define some grouped and/or random samples". What is that code doing? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Defining a new table called `MA-table`, which includes all the rows from our original table where state is "MA"}} +
@fitb{}{}

== Linear Model for Vermont (VT)

@n Define a new function `is-VT` and add it beneath `is-MA`.

@n Create a new grouped sample called `VT-table` and add it beneath `MA-table`.

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the best-possible linear model for the relationship between `day` and `positive` in the `VT-table`, then fill in the blanks below:

@indented{
The optimized linear model for this dataset predicts an @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} of about @fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{21}}{slope} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} per @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{day}}{x-variable}. +
The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{826}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{units}. @hspace{1em} I
@fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{disagree}}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit considering that @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from
@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{1092}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{6781}}{highest y-value}.}

== Exponential Model for Vermont (VT)
[.linkInstructions]
For this section, in addition to Pyret, open *Slide 5: Exponential Model for VT* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)*.


@n Turn to *Slide 5: Exponential Model for VT* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* and adjust the sliders until you've come up with the best exponential model you can for the Vermont dataset. Record your model below: +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{*Answers will vary.* Here's one for reference: `fun exponential-VT(x):  (0.08 * expt(1.06, (~1 * x))) + 1400 end`
}}

@n Return to @starter-file{alg2-covid}. At the bottom of the Definitions Area, define `exponential-VT` to be the model you just found.

- Click "Run" to load your definition.
- Then fit the model using `VT-table`

@indented{
According to this exponential model, on @fitbruby{6em}{June 9, 2020}{day zero} there were about 
@fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{0.08}}{a} + @fitbruby{2em}{@ifsoln{1400}}{k} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{positive COVID cases}}{y-units} in VT, for a total of about 
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{1400}}{a + k}. This number grew exponentially, increasing by a factor of 
@fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{1.06}}{Growth Factor: b} +
or
@fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{6}}{Growth Rate: (b - 1) &times; 100} percent every day. +
The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about
@fitbruby{2em}{@ifsoln{547}}{S}@fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{positive COVID cases}}{units}. +
I
@fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{significant}}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit considering that
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-units} in this dataset range from 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{1092}}{lowest y-value} to 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{6781}}{highest y-value}.
