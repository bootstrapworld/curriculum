|   			| # On Campus 	| # Off Campus	| % On Campus
| Undecided		| 120			|  80			|  120/200 = 60%
| Decided		|  80			| 100			|   80/180 = 44%

@n According to the table, how many Undecided Majors live _off_-campus? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{80}}

@n According to the table, how many Decided Majors live _on_-campus? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{80}}

@n Who is more likely to live on campus: Decided or Undecided Majors? @fitb{}{}

@n Do you think there is a relationship between deciding on a major and living on or off campus? If so, why?
