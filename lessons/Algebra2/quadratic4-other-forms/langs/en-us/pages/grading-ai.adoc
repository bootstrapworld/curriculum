An AI was asked to fit a quadratic model to each of the scatter plots below. For each one, the AI produced its model in either a factored form or vertex form. Did the AI do a good job? (_HINT: try drawing the curve-of-best-fit for these plots!_)

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong, and why?

@blanklines{5}{
Factored form shows us the roots of a quadratic equation (where it passes through the x-axis), but the roots are clearly closer to 10 and 20 than 30 and 40!

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
When the quadratic coefficient is negative, a parabola opens down. This one opens up. The vertex (0, 35) does look correct, however.

@center{*AI's Suggested Model: @math{f(x) = (x + 50)(x + 70)}*}

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
Factored form is @math{f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)}. For those subtraction signs to turn to addition, it means the AI is getting the sign of the roots wrong!
}


| @image{../images/vertex-15-100.png}
@center{*AI's Suggested Model: @math{f(x) = -1(x + 15)^2 + 100}*}

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
The AI got the sign right (opens down) and the y-coordinate of the vertex (100), but it got the sign of the vertex's x-coordinate wrong! The parent function is @math{f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k}, not @math{f(x) = a(x + h)^2 + k}. That means the AI thinks the vertex is at -15, when it's actually +15.
