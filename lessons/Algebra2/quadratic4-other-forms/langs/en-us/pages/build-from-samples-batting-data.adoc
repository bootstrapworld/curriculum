We're going to compute a quadratic function from 3 points. While it would be most accurate to keep track of decimal values, for today we are going to simplify our calculations by doing some rounding.

- Start by choosing 3 representative whole-coordinate points from the scatter plot.
  * a best guess at the where a curve summarizing the cluster would cross the y-axis
  * a point from the middle of the curve
  * a representative point toward the right side of the point cloud
- As we solve the system of equations, we'll likely get some very long decimal values. You can round these values to the ten thousandths place as we work.
