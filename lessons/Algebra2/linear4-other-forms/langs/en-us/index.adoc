== Other Forms of Linear Models
@objective{linear-forms}

=== Overview
Students are reminded of the three forms of linear models available to us, discuss when and why we might choose one form over another, and practice translating between them.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

When trying to fit a piece into a puzzle, sometimes we rotate the piece to see it from a different angle. When fitting a model to a dataset, we might prefer to look at the linear relationship from different angles as well!

@slidebreak{Launch}

We will mostly be using @vocab{Slope-Intercept} form of the line in this course, because it's the simplest form that is defined in terms of the response variable, making it most compatible with the programming environment.

But depending on the information we have available to us - or who we're writing this model for - we might want to use _other_ forms of linear models, like @vocab{Point-Slope} or @vocab{Standard Form}. Fortunately, we can always translate any model into another!

@slidebreak{Launch}

You may already be familiar with the different forms of linear models available to us:

[cols="^5a,^6a,^5a", options="header"]
|===
| Slope-Intercept		| Point-Slope				| Standard
| @math{y = mx+b}		| @math{y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)}	| @math{Ax+By = C}
<| 
- m: {nbsp}slope
- b: {nbsp}y-intercept / vertical shift
<|
- m: slope
- @math{y_1}: {nbsp}y-coordinate of a point
- @math{x_1}: {nbsp}x-coordinate of the same point
<|
- x-int:  @hspace{1em}@math{\frac{C}{A}}
- y-int:  @hspace{1em}@math{\frac{C}{B}}
- slope:  @hspace{1em}@math{- \frac{A}{B}}
| Makes it really easy to read the slope and y-intercept.
| Makes it easy to find the equation of the line given a single point and slope.
| Makes it easy to find the x- and y-intercepts of the line.

@strategy{Why do we use these letters as stand-ins for the constants?}{
The letters used in these forms of the line are just conventions people have agreed upon over time! 

Standardized conventions have their benefits, but sometimes they also have downsides.

For example, some students might be confused by the fact that:

- @math{b} in the slope-intercept form and @math{B} in standard form represent different things
- @math{b} represents the vertical shift in linear models while it represents the base in exponential models

As we've thought through what would best support students with learning to model data, we've learned that people are in less agreement about how to name constants for non-linear models. 

We believe that students are best supported by using letters that highlight the similarities between the various models.  Our nonlinear modeling materials will consistently use @math{k} for the vertical shift.

Applying this to the point-slope form, we'd get: @hspace{1em} @math{y=mx+ k}

You can foreshadow this for your students by discussing the fact that while the letters used are conventions, they are just stand-ins for the patterns we can see with our eyes. Having identified the pattern of the point-slope form, we could just as easily have written it with other letters.

@teacher{Pose the questions below to assess student understanding of when and why we might choose one form over another.}

@slidebreak{Launch}

Why we might choose to use one form over another?

@QandA{
@Q{Suppose our scatter plot has a state with 0% college enrollment, and another with $0 median income. Which linear form would be easiest to use?}
@A{Standard Form}
@Q{Suppose we only know the slope of a model, but we know the college graduation rate _and_ median income for Rhode Island. Which form would make it easy to figure out the rest of the model?}
@A{Point-Slope Form}
@Q{Which form makes it easiest to define our model in Pyret?}
@A{Slope-Intercept Form}
}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

Based on the information available to us, it might be easier to use one form over another. But for someone else to _read and understand_ that model, we might choose a different model! Fortunately, we can easily translate back and forth between linear forms!

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's practice identifying which form of a linear model is easiest to write with the given information and then translating models from each of those forms into Pyret function definitions.
- Turn to @printable-exercise{which-form.adoc}
- @opt{Practice translating some of the models we found for predicting `median-income` from a state's `pct-college-or-higher` into other forms on @opt-printable-exercise{other-forms-linear-models.adoc}.
}
}


=== Synthesize
@slidebreak{Synthesize}

@QandA{
@Q{If you needed to draw the graph of a linear model, which form would you like to start from? Why?}
@A{Answers will vary.}
@A{If we're making the graph in Pyret, though, point-slope is definitely easiest because it's already solved for y!}

== Investigating Horizontal and Vertical Shifts

=== Overview

Students explore the relationship between horizontal and vertical shifts of linear functions, preparing them to think about horizontal shift in other classes of functions (e.g. - quadratic, exponential, etc.). Written exercises accompany an interactive Desmos slider activity we've created.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

Lines can be shifted up, down, left and right by adding and subtracting to their definitions. Let's see if we can decode the pattern!

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @opt-printable-exercise{horizontal-shift.adoc}, which will guide you through the Desmos activity: @link{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hong7gv82k, Exploring Horizontal and Linear Shifts in Linear Functions} step by step.
- As you work through the activities, pay careful attention to directions telling you know which graphs to turn "on" and "off" for each section.
}

@teacher{There are 3 folders in this Desmos activity. Students will open them one at a time by clicking on the triangles, and then turning the lines defined within them on and off as directed using the circles in front of the folders.}

@opt{These two paper and pencil exercises guide students through thinking about how horizontal and vertical shifts are related, depending on whether a line has a positive or negative slope:

- @opt-printable-exercise{hor-vert-shift-positive.adoc}
- @opt-printable-exercise{hor-vert-shift-negative.adoc}

What did you discover about recognizing horizontal and vertical shifts from linear equations?
