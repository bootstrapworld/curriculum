== Interpreting a Quadratic Model

@n The *vertex form* of a quadratic model is shown below. Fill in the blank using the "peak" of your curve from @printable-exercise{quadratic1-exploring-batting-data/pages/exploring-mpg.adoc}:

@center{@math{f(x) = a(x −}@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{45}}{peak efficiency}@math{)^2 + k}}

@center{*In the Definitions Area of your @starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency}, you'll find the definition of a quadratic model `quad1`.*}

@n In `quad1`, the value of @math{a} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{1}}, the value of @math{h} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{0}}, and the value of @math{k} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{0}}

@n Fit this model to your dataset, using `fit-model`. What @math{S} value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{TODO}}

@n In your own words, describe what should change about this model to fit the data. @fitb{}{} +

== Modeling Fuel Efficiency

Complete the following sentences, referring back to @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc} as-needed. The first one has been completed for you.

@n When a parabola opens "up", @fitb{15em}{_a_ is positive}. When it opens "down", @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a is negative}}

@n When a parabola is "narrow", @fitb{11em}{@ifsoln{a is large}}. When it is "wide", @fitb{11em}{@ifsoln{a is small}}. When it is "flat", @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a is zero}}

@n To shift a parabola right, @fitb{15em}{@ifsoln{make h larger}}. To shift it left, @fitb{}{@ifsoln{make h smaller}}

@n To shift a parabola up, @fitb{15em}{@ifsoln{make k larger}}. To shift it down, @fitb{}{@ifsoln{make k smaller}}

@center{*For each of the following questions, define a _new function_ (e.g. `quad2`, `quad3`, etc.) and click Run.*}

@n What value of @math{h} best matches the shape of the curve? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~45}} What @math{S} value did you get when you re-fit the model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{TODO}}

@n What value of @math{a} best matches the shape of the curve? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~0.01}} What @math{S} value did you get when you re-fit the model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{TODO}}

@n What value of @math{k} best matches the shape of the curve? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~32}} What @math{S} value did you get when you re-fit the model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{TODO}}

@star *What does this model actually mean? Try completing the sentence below:*

After experimenting, I came up with a quadratic model showing that _speed_ explains @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{about 73.3}}{R-squared * 100}% of the variability in _gas mileage_ for cars in this dataset. The vertex of the parabola drawn by this model is @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{about 45}}{x-value of vertex}, which means that @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{45mph is the most efficient speed to drive}}
