Decide whether each situation is best described by a linear or quadratic function.

== MTV Royalties
*MTV paid a songwriter $1000 to use the recording on their show. After that, the songwriter gets a check for $26 in performance royalties for their songwriting every time the episode airs.*

@n Do royalties increase or decrease over time? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}

@n When the songwriter agrees to let MTV use the recording on their show (x=0), how much money do they earn? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$1000}}

@n How many dollars will they have after...

== Tuition Savings Account
*A family managed to save $18,000 by the time their child started studying to be an electrician at the community college, where tuition and fees cost $2200 per semester.*

== Stopping Time
*In a certain car, from the time a driver steps on the breaks, the vehicle decelerates at a rate of 10 meters per second. We can calculate the time it takes to stop the car, by squaring the speed it's driving in meters per second and dividing by 20.*

@n How long does it take to stop the car when it's driving at 0 kmh (x=0)? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{0 seconds}}

@n Does stop time increase or decrease as speed increases? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}
