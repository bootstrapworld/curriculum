@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. +
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-exploring-quadratics-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first two slides.
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}
}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- Unlike linear functions, which are governed by slope and y-intercept, quadratic functions are governed by the behavior of _three_ factors.
- Students should gain an intuition for these factors by playing with them first in Desmos, then use them to fit a model in Pyret.

== Quadratic Sequences

@objective{quadratics-growth}

=== Overview
Students formalize their understanding of quadratic relationships, learning how to identify them arithmetically.

=== Launch
@slidestyle{Launch}

@QandA{
@Q{What do we know about Quadratic Relationships?}
@A{Answers will vary.}
@A{Their graphs are u-shaped, either rising, slowing, peaking, and falling or falling, slowing, bottoming out, and then rising again.
}
}

@opt{Have students complete @opt-printable-exercise{classifying-plots.adoc}.
}

=== Investigate
@slidestyle{Investigate}
We've seen quadratic relationships that _rise-and-fall_ or _fall-and-rise_. But sometimes we'll encounter datasets that include only the _rising_ part of the parabola or only the _falling_ part, so we need to know how to recognize whether a sequence of x-y pairs is part of a parabola without looking for a change in direction.

=== Identifying Quadratic Relationships from a Sequence of numbers

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@right{@image{images/difference-table-linear.png}}
Remember that linear functions grow by _fixed intervals,_ so the rate of change is _constant_. +
{empty} +
In the table shown here, each time the x-value increases by 1, we see that the y-value increases by 2. This is true for any set of equal-sized intervals: a line needs to slope up or down at a constant rate in order to be a straight line! +
{empty} +
*If the rate of growth is constant, the relationship is linear.*

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@right{@image{images/difference-table-quadratic.png}}
@vocab{Quadratic functions} grow by intervals that _increase by fixed amounts!_ In the table to the right, the blue arrows show a differently-sized jump between identical intervals time, meaning _the function is definitely not linear!_ +
{empty} +
However, if we take a look at the _difference between those differences_(shown in red), we're back to constant growth! +
{empty} +
*If the "growth of the growth" is constant, the relationship is quadratic.*

@QandA{
@Q{What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?}
@Q{Which one is linear, and how do you know?}
@A{The second table is linear, because the y values growth is constant relative to x.}
@Q{Which one is quadratic, and how do you know?}
@A{The first table is quadratic, because the y values "growth of the growth" is constant relative to x.}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}
@lesson-instruction{
- Identify whether each of the remaining tables on @printable-exercise{classifying-tables.adoc} is quadratic, linear or neither.
- Use the space to the right of the table to show your work.
}

@teacher{Debrief with students and encourage them to share the different strategies that they used. Note: When looking at real-world datasets that can be modeled by linear or quadratic functions, these patterns will not be evident in the tables, because the points won't fit the function perfectly!}

=== Synthesize
@slidestyle{Synthesize}

@QandA{
@Q{What strategies did you use to decide which tables were quadratic?}
@A{Answers will vary. But it's important to make sure that students' thinking goes beyond identifying that a sequence is nonlinear and delves into confirming that the growth of the growth is constant.}
@Q{What strategies did you use to decide between whether a table showed a relationship that was neither linear nor quadratic vs a table that showed no relationship?}
@A{Answers will vary. But if we can predict the next y-value, we know there is a relationship.}

== Graphing Quadratic Functions
@objective{quadratics-graph}
@objective{quadratics-model-settings}

=== Overview
Students shift from numbers to graphs, as students learn the vocabulary for describing parabolas.

=== Launch
@slidestyle{Launch}

As we work with parabolas - and eventually fit them to Aaron Judge's Baseball Batting Data - we need to know how to talk about and describe them.

@slidebreak{Launch}

@QandA{
@Q{Linear relationships can be described with terms like "slope" and "y-intercept". But what about quadratic relationships? Do parabolas have slope?}
@A{No. They curve because they *do not* have a constant rate of change.}
@Q{Do all parabolas have x-intercepts?}
@A{No. Some do and some don't!}
@Q{Can you point out or describe other important parts of a parabola?}
@A{Even without knowing the names for these things, students might point to the vertex, the axis of symmetry, etc.}
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

==== Terminology for Talking about Parabolas

[cols="^.^3a,^.^3a,^.^3a", options="header", stripes="none"]
|===
| vertex
| y-intercept
| x-intercept

| @image{images/opens.png, 250}
| @image{images/y-intercept.png, 200}
| @image{images/roots.png, 250}

| The point at which a parabola "changes direction" and goes from climbing to sinking (or vice versa).
| Like linear models, parabolas always cross the y-axis once when @math{x=0}, and we call this the @vocab{y-intercept}.
| Also known as @vocab{roots} or @vocab{zeros}. A quadratic function can cross the x-axis once, twice, or not at all.
|===

@slidebreak{LaunchR}

@right{@image{images/axis-of-symmetry.png, 150}}

There are two more specific terms that we can use to describe a parabola's @vocab{vertex}:

- The @vocab{maximum} is the vertex of a parabola that "opens down."
- The @vocab{minimum} is the vertex of a parabola that "opens up."

For parabolas representing @math{y} as a quadratic function of @math{x}, we can imagine a vertical line through the @vocab{vertex} that splits the parabola into two congruent parts that mirror one another. This line is the @vocab{axis of symmetry}, which for quadratics always passes through the vertex (these axes exist in other shapes and functions, as well!).

@slidebreak{Launch}

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @printable-exercise{parabolas.adoc} to apply our new terminology by sketching and labeling some graphs.
}


=== Investigate
@slidestyle{Investigate}

One form of a quadratic model looks like this: @hspace{1em} @big{@math{f(x) = a(x âˆ’ h)^2 + k}}

Let's find out how each of the model settings influences the shape of the parabola!

@strategy{Where does "Model Settings" come from?}{

Educators choose vocabulary carefully, assigning clear names to concepts that are abstract and important. As an example, what vocabulary word should math teachers use for @math{a}, @math{b}, and @math{c} in the parent function for below?

@center{
@big{@math{f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c}}
}

- "Variable" means "the input the function needs", which is clearly @math{x}
- "Coefficient" would apply to @math{a} and @math{b}, because they are part of terms that use @math{x}.
- "Constant" is perfectly accurate, but that word is often conflated with the _constant term_ in an equation. Most calculus students would argue that only @math{c} is a constant!

_We believe the lack of a distinct term for such an important concept is a problem in math education._ *We've chosen to use "Model Settings" as a neutral term for these values.* Every type and form of model has them, and each setting determines the behavior of a model.
}

@teacher{Make sure you have created a link or code for your class to @starter-file{alg2-exploring-quadratics-desmos}.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Open *Exploring Quadratic Functions (Desmos)*.
- Use *Slide 1: Transforming Parabolas* to complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}
- @opt{When you're done, continue your exploration with *Slide 2: Do horizontal shifts correspond to vertical shifts for quadratic functions?*}}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

==== Quadratic Coefficient (@math{a})

@QandA{
@Q{How do you make a parabola "narrower"?}
@A{Increase the value of @math{a}}
@Q{How do you make a parabola "wider"?}
@A{Decrease the value of @math{a}}
@Q{How do we know from the equation whether a parabola opens up or down?}
@A{If @math{a} is negative, it will open down. If @math{a} is positive, it will open up.}
@Q{What value of @math{a} will result in a _linear_ model?}
@A{Zero}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-point{
The quadratic coefficient  @math{a} tells us whether the parabola opens up or down, and how tightly it hugs the axis of symmetry.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

==== Horizontal Shift (@math{h})

@QandA{
@Q{How do you translate a parabola to the left?}
@A{Increase the value of @math{h}.}
@Q{How do you translate a parabola to the right?}
@A{Decrease the value of @math{h}.}
@Q{What does an @math{h} of zero tell us about the axis of symmetry?}
@A{It's the y-axis.}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-point{
The @vocab{horizontal shift} @math{h} tells us where the axis of symmetry hits the x-axis, which means it also tells us the x-coordinate of the vertex.
}

==== Vertical Shift (@math{k})

@QandA{
@Q{How do you translate a parabola up and down?}
@A{Change the value of @math{k}}
@Q{How can you find the coordinates of the parabola's vertex, just by looking at the equation?}
@A{@math{h} tells us the x-coordinate, and @math{k} tells us the y-coordinate.}
@Q{In linear functions, we know that translate any horizontal shift to translation with a vertical shift. Is this also true for quadratic functions? Why or Why not?}
@A{No. That only worked for linear functions because they extend indefinitely without changing direction. Quadratic functions curve, so horizontal shifts and vertical shifts don't translate to each other.}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-point{
Like the y-intercept of a linear model, the @vocab{vertical shift} @math{k} translates the parabola up and down.
}

=== Synthesize
@slidestyle{Synthesize}

@QandA{
@Q{What key characteristics of a scatter plot would provide the clue that we should look for a quadratic model rather than a linear model?}
@Q{Why do some parabolas have roots and others don't?}
@A{If the minimum is negative, it will fall below the x-axis. That will make the parabola cross the x-axis twice as it opens up, so there will be two roots. Similarly, there will be two roots if the maximum is positive.}
@A{If the minimum or maximum is zero it will fall directly on the x-axis and there will be one root}
@A{If the minimum is greater than zero or the maximum is less than zero, the parabola won't cross the x-axis and there won't be any roots.}
@Q{What is the difference between a minimum and a maximum?}
@A{A minimum is the vertex of a parabola that opens up, while a maximum is the vertex of a parabola that opens down.}
