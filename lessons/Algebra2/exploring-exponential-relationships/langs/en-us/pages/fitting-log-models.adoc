= Fitting Logarithmic Models

For this page, you'll need to the  @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1StX6mmWMYPQOpH8ab1WiAlvPYeMlMEAD, Countries of the World Starter File} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

**In this exercise you'll have a chance to build and fit more models to the data, now armed with new tools that let you experiment with logs and exponents.** These tools are listed here:

- @show{(contract "num-log" '("Number") "Number" "Consumes a number, and produces its natural log")}
- @show{(contract "num-log-base" '("Number" "Number") "Number" "Consumes a number and a base, and produces the log of that number with the base")}
- @show{(contract "num-expt" '("Number" "Number") "Number" "Consumes a number and a power, and produces that number raised to the power")}

@n Find the rows for Afghanistan and Albania, and record their x- and y- values below:

[cols="^1a, ^1a", options="header"]
|===
| Afghanistan
| Albania
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~1990.51}}{income}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{52.1}}{median-lifespan}
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~11765.59}}{income}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{78.6}}{median-lifespan}
|===

@n Find a logarithmic function that passes through these two points, showing your work and writing your function on the line below

@vspace{3in}

@fitb{}{@math{f(x) = }@ifsoln{@math{14.9146 \times log(0.0165x)} - _Answers will vary_}}

@n Define this function in Definitions Area, and click "Run". Make sure you fix any errors or warnings. In the Interactions Area, make sure `f(1990.51)` and `f(11765.59)` predict the correct median lifespan for Afghanistan and Albania!

@n Try plugging in different `income` values from _other_ countries, to see how well a model based only on Afghanistan and Albania fits for the rest of the world.

@n Use `model-fit` to see how well this logarithmic function fits the dataset. What @math{R^2} value did you get? @fitb{}{}

@n What's the best model you can build, using these tools? In the table below, record your models and the @math{R^2} values you got for them.

[.FillVerticalSpace, cols="^1a, ^1a", options="header"]
|===
| Model (Function or Pyret Notation - whatever you prefer!)   | @math{R^2}
|                                                             |
