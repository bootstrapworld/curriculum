== The `al-ak` Model

Type @show{(code '(fit-model states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income" al-ak))} in the Interactions Area, then find the points for AL and AK along the predictor line. _Hint: You know their coordinates and they will help you know where to look!_

@n What do you Notice? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. AL and AK are both on the line, but they don't seem to be very representative of the group.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line goes all the way up to $200,000 but median income doesn't seem to exceed $80000.}}

@n What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. What states might have been more representative of the trend?}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Find @math{S} in the upper left corner. What is the @math{S} value (the number after @math{S})? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~36164.683}}

@link-instructions{
In the Definitions Area, find the section titled *Define some other models by modifying al-ak*. +
For now, all three definitions in this section are exactly the same as `al-ak`. You will be changing them according to the directions below.
}

@n `less-steep`

- If you wanted the model to be _less steep_, what slope could you use? @fitb{}{} +
Change the definition for `less-steep` to use the slope you wrote above and click "Run" to load your new definition.

- Type @show{(code '(fit-model states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income" less-steep))}
  * What is the @math{S} value of `less-steep`? @fitb{}{}

- Identify a y-intercept that would make the model fit the data better: @fitb{}{}

  * Adjust the definition to use the new y-intercept, click "Run" and refit the model. +
   _Hint: You can click in the Interactions Area and hit the up arrow to bring back the last line of code you used._
  * What is the @math{S} value of `less-steep` now? @fitb{}{}

@n `negative`

- If wanted your model to have a _negative slope_, what slope could you use? @fitb{}{} +
Change the definition of `negative` to use the slope you wrote above and click "Run" to load your new definition. Then fit the model.

- What is the @math{S} value of `negative`? @fitb{}{}

@n `horizontal`

- If you wanted your model to be horizontal, what would you have to change? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Slope for horizontal lines should be zero, which means that the variable term can be removed.}} +
Change the definition of `horizontal` so that it draws a horizontal model. Click "Run" and fit this model.

  * What is the @math{S} value of `horizontal`? @fitb{}{}

- Change the y-intercept so that the horizontal line passes through more of the data points. Click "Run" and fit this model.

  * What y-intercept did you use? @fitb{10em}{} What is the @math{S} value of `horizontal` now? @fitb{}{}

@n What did you notice? What did you wonder? @fitb{}{}
