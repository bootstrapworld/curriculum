== The `al-ak` Model

Type @show{(code '(fit-model states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income" al-ak))} in the Interactions Area, then find the points for AL and AK along the predictor line. _Hint: You know their coordinates and they will help you know where to look!_

@n What do you Notice? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. AL and AK are both on the line, but they don't seem to be very representative of the group.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line goes all the way up to $200,000 but median income doesn't seem to exceed $80000.}}

@n What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. What states might have been more representative of the trend?}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Find @math{S} in the upper left corner. What is the @math{S} value (the number after @math{S})? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~36164.683}}

@n With median income ranging from
@fitbruby{9em}{@ifsoln{$39,031}}{lowest median income} to
@fitbruby{9em}{@ifsoln{$73538}}{highest median income}, what does the @math{S-value} of the `al-ak` model tell us?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We know that there’s enough error in the model to predict median incomes that are off by $36,165!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Considering the range of the data, the error in the model is enough to double the median income of a state or cut it in half!}}


== A Model of Your Own

@n Identify two other states that you think would make a better model: @fitb{13em}{} and @fitb{13em}{}.

@vspace{1ex}

- Add two new definitions for these states to your @starter-file{alg2-states-fit-model}.

@n Record the `college-or-higher` and `median-income` values for these states, as (x,y) pairs below:

@center{(@fitbruby{10em}{}{college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{10em}{}{median-income}) @hspace{10em} (@fitbruby{10em}{}{college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{12em}{}{median-income})}

@n Derive your model and write it below (in both Function and Pyret notation), then fit the model and record the @math{S}-value:

[.FillVerticalSpace, cols="1a", frame="none"]
|===
|
|===

@indented{
@math{other(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{}{slope (m)}x + @fitbruby{10em}{}{y-intercept / vertical shift}

@show{(code '(define (other x) (+ (* (?ANS "varies") x) (?ANS "varies"))))} @hspace{2em} @math{S}:@fitb{5em}{}
}

@n Adjust the slope and y-intercept of your model to get the *smallest @math{S} possible.* Write the best model you find (and corresponding @math{S}) below:

@indented{
@math{best(x) =} @fitbruby{7em}{}{slope (m)}x + @fitbruby{11em}{}{y-intercept / vertical shift}

@show{(code '(define (best x) (+ (* (?ANS "will vary") x) (?ANS "will vary"))))} @hspace{2em} @math{S}: @fitb{5em}{}
}

== Comparing Models

@n Is your model better or worse than the `al-ak` model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{better!}}

@n How much
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{more}}{more / less }
error do we expect in predictions made with your model than predictions made with the `al-ak` model?

@math{
\frac{&#8192; \mbox{Difference} &#8192; \mbox{between} &#8192; \mbox{the} &#8192; \mbox{S-values}&#8192;}

\times 100 &#8192; = &#8192; }
@math{\frac{\qquad}{\qquad}}
}

We expect predictions made with my model to have
@fitb{4em}{} percent
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{less}}{ more / less }
error than predictions made with the `al-ak` model!
