== Adjusting Models through Trial and Error
@link-instructions{
In the Definitions Area, find the section titled *Define some other models by modifying mi-ca*. +
For now, all three definitions in this section are exactly the same as `mi-ca`. You will be changing them according to the directions below.
}

@n `less-steep`

- If you wanted the model to be _less steep_, what slope could you use? @fitb{}{} +
Change the definition for `less-steep` to use the slope you wrote above and click "Run" to load your new definition.

- Type @show{(code '(fit-model states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income" less-steep))}
  * What is the @math{S} value of `less-steep`? @fitb{}{}

- Identify a y-intercept that would make the model fit the data better: @fitb{}{}

  * Adjust the definition to use the new y-intercept, click "Run" and refit the model. +
   _Hint: You can click in the Interactions Area and hit the up arrow to bring back the last line of code you used._
  * What is the @math{S} value of `less-steep` now? @fitb{}{}

@n `negative`

- If wanted your model to have a _negative slope_, what slope could you use? @fitb{}{} +
Change the definition of `negative` to use the slope you wrote above and click "Run" to load your new definition. Then fit the model.

- What is the @math{S} value of `negative`? @fitb{}{}

@n `horizontal`

- If you wanted your model to be horizontal, what would you have to change? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Slope for horizontal lines should be zero, which means that the variable term can be removed.}} +
Change the definition of `horizontal` so that it draws a horizontal model. Click "Run" and fit this model.

  * What is the @math{S} value of `horizontal`? @fitb{}{}

- Change the y-intercept so that the horizontal line passes through more of the data points. Click "Run" and fit this model.

  * What y-intercept did you use? @fitb{10em}{} What is the @math{S} value of `horizontal` now? @fitb{}{}


== The `ma-nv` Model

Find `# Define some rows` in the Definitions Area. +
Add two new definitions for `MA` (row 21) and `NV` (row 28), using the definitions for `alaska` and `alabama` as a model.

@n Record the `college-or-higher` and `median-income` values for `MA` and `NV`, as @math{(x,y)} pairs below:

@center{
 (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{39.4}}{MA college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{66866}}{MA median-income}) @hspace{10em} (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{22.4}}{NV college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{52800}}{NV median-income})
}

@n Derive the `MA-NV model` (using the same steps you followed to derive the `AL-AK model` on @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income-2.adoc}) and write it below (in both Function and Pyret notation), then fit the model and record the @math{S}-value:

[.FillVerticalSpace, cols="1a", frame="none"]
|===
|
|===

@math{ma-nv(x) =} @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{827.41}}{slope (m)}x + @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{34266.05}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{1em} @show{(code '(define (ma-nv x) (+ (* (?ANS 827.41) x) (?ANS 34266.05))))} @hspace{1em} @math{S}: @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~7,504.54}}
