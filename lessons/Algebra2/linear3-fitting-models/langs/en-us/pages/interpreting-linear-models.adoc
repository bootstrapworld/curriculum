== Build a Model Computationally

`lr-plot` computes the _optimal linear model_ using all of the data points.

@n Evaluate @show{(code '(lr-plot states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income"))}. What is @math{S}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

@n On the line below, write the optimal linear model that was computed through linear regression:

@center{
 @math{optimal(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{@math{1142}}}{slope (m)}x + @fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{20868.14}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (optimal x) (+ (* (?ANS 1142) x) (?ANS 20868.14))))}
}

== Interpret the `al-ak` Model

We started with a model based on Alabama and Alaska @show{(code '(define (al-ak x) (+ (* 5613.67 x) -83616.02)))} @hspace{1em} `S: ~36164.68` +
which we can interpret as follows:

== Interpreting the Optimal Model

The @fitbruby{20em}{linear-regression}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1
@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{percent}}{x-axis units} increase in
@fitbruby{20em}{@ifsoln{percent college degrees}}{explanatory variable (x)} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{1142 dollar}}{slope, y-units}
@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in
@fitbruby{20em}{@ifsoln{median household income}}{response variable (y)}. With an @math{S}-value of
@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~9,930.58}}{S-value}
@fitbruby{15em}{dollars}{y-axis units} and
@fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{median household income}}{y-axis} ranging from
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{$39,031}}{lowest y-value} to
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{$73,538}}{highest y-value}, I
@fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{}}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit.


@n What does the *slope (m)* of this linear model tell us? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The amount by which median income increases for each percentage of citizens who finished college}}

@n What does the *y-intercept / vertical shift* of this linear model tell us? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The median income of a state with no college graduates}}

@n Suppose a state goes from 10% to 11% college graduation. According to this model, 

  * What kind of change would we expect to see in the median household income? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{$1142}} 
  * What if it goes from 50% to 51%? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{$1142}}
  * What if it goes from 90% to 91%? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{$1142}}

@n Does this model predict the same increase in income for _every_ additional 1% `college-or-higher`? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. Linear models increase by equal amounts over all equal intervals}}
