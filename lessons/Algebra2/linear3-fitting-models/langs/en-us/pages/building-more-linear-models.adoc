We've already built models for `pct-college-or-higher` and `median-income`, but that's not the only relationship in this dataset!

@n What other relationship are you curious about? +
@center{@fitbruby{20em}{}{explanatory variable (x)} @hspace{1em} and @hspace{1em} @fitbruby{20em}{}{response variable (y)}}

@n Fill in the code to make a scatter plot exploring the relationship between those columns:

@show{(code '(scatter-plot states-table "state" (?ANS ______________________) (?ANS ______________________)))}

@n Pick two states that you think would generate a good first model:
@center{@fitb{17em}{} @hspace{1em} and @hspace{1em} @fitb{17em}{}}

@n Calculate the slope and y-intercept for a line passing through these two point and use them to define your model. Then type this model into Pyret, and fit it to your data use `fit-model`.

@show{(code '(define (my-new x) (+ (* (?ANS ______) x) (?ANS ______))))} @hspace{2em} @math{S}-value  @fitb{}{}

@n Use `lr-plot` to build the optimal linear model for this relationship.

@show{(code '(define (best-new x) (+ (* (?ANS ______) x) (?ANS ______))))} @hspace{2em} @math{S}-value  @fitb{}{}

@n Based on these @math{S}-values, we would expect predictions made with this best possible model to have @fitb{5em}{} percent less error than predictions made with the linear model I generated from two points.

@n *What does this model actually mean? Try completing the sentences below:*

_This model predicts that a 1
@fitbruby{10em}{percent}{x-axis units} increase in
@fitbruby{20em}{}{explanatory variable (x)} is associated with a
@fitbruby{20em}{}{rate of change in y-units}
@fitbruby{10em}{increase}{increase / decrease} in
@fitbruby{20em}{}{response variable (y)}. +
Based on the @math{S} of
@fitbruby{10em}{}{S} and
@fitbruby{15em}{}{response variable (y)} ranging from
@fitbruby{8em}{}{lowest y-value} to
@fitbruby{8em}{}{highest y-value}, +
I
@fitbruby{18em}{}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit._
