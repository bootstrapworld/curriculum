For this page, you'll need to the  @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1StX6mmWMYPQOpH8ab1WiAlvPYeMlMEAD, Countries of the World Starter File} open on your computer. __If you haven't already__, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

**In this exercise you'll have a chance to build and fit more models to the data, now armed with new tools that let you experiment with logs and exponents.** These tools are listed here (as well as in your contracts pages):

== Build a Model from Samples

@n Record these values as (x,y) pairs below:

@center{
 (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~1990.51}}{Afghanistan pc-gdp}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{52.1}}{Afghanistan median-lifespan}) @hspace{10em} (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~11765.59}}{Albania pc-gdp}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{78.6}}{Albania median-lifespan})
}

@n Using the two points above, define a logarithmic model. Show your work below, then define the function in Function Notation and Pyret.

@ifsoln{Note: Answers will vary!}@vspace{1.5in}

@center{
 @math{f(x) = }
 @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{@math{14.9146}}}{log coefficient}
 @math{log( }
 @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{0.0165}}{linear coefficient}
 @math{x) + }
 @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{0}}{constant}
 @hspace{2em}
 @show{(code '(define (f x) (+ (* (?ANS 14.9146) (log (* (?ANS 0.0165) x))) (?ANS 0))))}
}

@n Change the function `f` to match this model, and click "Run". Make sure you fix any errors or warnings. In the Interactions Area, make sure `f(1990.51)` and `f(11765.59)` predict the correct median lifespan for Afghanistan and Albania!

@vspace{1ex}

@n Try plugging in different `pc-gdp` values from _other_ countries, to see how well a model based only on Afghanistan and Albania fits for the rest of the world. For which country does it work well? @fitb{5em}{} For what country does it work poorly? @fitb{5em}{}

== Fit the Model

@n Use `fit-model` to see how well this logarithmic function fits the dataset. What @math{R^2} value did you get? @fitb{}{}

== Build a Model through Trial {amp} Error

@n What is the @math{R^2} for **the best model you can come up with**? @fitb{5em}{} Write the model below.

@center{
 @math{f(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{}{y-intercept} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (f x) (+ (* (?ANS "will vary") x) (?ANS "will vary"))))}
}
