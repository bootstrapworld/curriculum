= Fitting a Model: Wealth v. Lifespan

For this page, you'll need to the  @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1StX6mmWMYPQOpH8ab1WiAlvPYeMlMEAD, Countries of the World Starter File} open on your computer. __If you haven't already__, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

**In this exercise you'll have a chance to build and fit more models to the data, now armed with new tools that let you experiment with logs and exponents.** These tools are listed here (as well as in your contracts pages):

- @show{(contract "num-log" '("Number") "Number" "Consumes a number, and produces its natural log")}
- @show{(contract "num-log-base" '("Number" "Number") "Number" "Consumes a number and a base, and produces the log of that number with the base")}
- @show{(contract "num-expt" '("Number" "Number") "Number" "Consumes a number and a power, and produces that number raised to the power")}

@n Test out `afghanistan["pc-gdp"]`, `afghanistan["median-lifespan"]`, `albania["pc-gdp"]`, `albania["median-lifespan"]`, and `. What are these square brackets doing?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{they look up the value of the specified column}}

@n Record these values as (x,y) pairs below:

@center{
 @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~1990.51}}{Afghanistan pc-gdp}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{52.1}}{Afghanistan median-lifespan} @hspace{10em} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~11765.59}}{Albania pc-gdp}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{78.6}}{Albania median-lifespan}
}

@n Using the two points above, define a logarithmic model. Show your work below, then define the function in Function Notation and Pyret.

@vspace{3in}

@fitb{}{@math{f(x) = }@ifsoln{@math{14.9146 \times log(0.0165x)} - _Answers may vary_}}

@n Change the function `f` to match this model, and click "Run". Make sure you fix any errors or warnings. In the Interactions Area, make sure `f(1990.51)` and `f(11765.59)` predict the correct median lifespan for Afghanistan and Albania!

@n Try plugging in different `pc-gdp` values from _other_ countries, to see how well a model based only on Afghanistan and Albania fits for the rest of the world. For which country does it work well? @fitb{5em}{} For what country does it work poorly? @fitb{5em}{}

@n Use `model-fit` to see how well this logarithmic function fits the dataset. What @math{R^2} value did you get? @fitb{}{}

@n What's the best model you can build, using these tools? In the table below, record your models and the @math{R^2} values you got for them.
