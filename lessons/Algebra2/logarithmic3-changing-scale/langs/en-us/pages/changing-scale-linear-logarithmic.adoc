- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

== An _Exponential_ Sequence on a Logarithmic Number Line
@link-instructions{Make sure you're on *Slide 5: Changing Scale (Linear â†’ Logarithmic)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models*.}

@n Find list @math{a} on the left. (It's an exponential sequence from @math{1} to @math{1048576}.) What is the @vocab{growth factor} of this sequence? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{2}}

@n Complete the list of "tick marks" (showing intervals on the *y-axis*) from the origin to the top of the screen. Then _continue the pattern_ +
@hspace{1.5em} for three more numbers: @fitb{}{_0, 5, 10,_ @ifsoln{15, 20, 25, 30}}

@n What kind of growth does the sequence you just wrote show (circle one): @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{linear} @hspace{2em} quadratic @hspace{2em} exponential?

@n Click the (@big{@math{-}}) to zoom out until you can see all of the red dots. (_Hint: They go up to 1,048,576!_).

- What y-axis labels do you see now? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-1000000, -500000, 0, 500000, 1000000}}
- What happens to the red dots from list @math{a} as you zoom out? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They get squished together.}} +
- Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because the space between each value is exponentially larger.}}

@n Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *open the "Graph Settings" window.*

@indented{*Expand the "More Options" section* by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#). +
*Change the y-axis scale* from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`, and close the settings window by clicking on the graph. +
*Adjust your zoom settings* until you can see all of the red dots from @math{a}, filling the screen from top-to-bottom.
}

- What happened to the red dots, showing our exponential sequence? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They look like they are spaced at consistent intervals!}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Complete the list of _new_ tick marks, from the origin to the top of the screen: @fitb{}{_1, 100,_ @ifsoln{@math{10^4}, @math{10^6}}}

@n What kind of growth does the sequence you just wrote show (circle one): @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{linear} @hspace{2em} quadratic @hspace{2em} exponential?

@n Explain what you think is happening here. @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

== An _Exponential_ Graph on a Logarithmic y-axis
- *Change the y-axis back to `Linear`*
- *Click the circle to the left of "[.desmosbutton]#{caret}# Exponential Relationship"*, to show the values of @math{a} plotted along the function @hspace{1em} @big{@math{f(x)=2^x}}
- *Then Change the y-axis back to `Logarithmic`*.

@n What happens to the black dots, and the graph of the function? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{they turn linear!}}

@n Explain what you think is happening here. @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

== A _Linear_ Graph on a Logarithmic y-axis

- *In your Desmos activity, advance to Slide 6.*
- *The linear function @hspace{0.5ex} @big{@math{g(x)=x}} @hspace{0.5ex} is shown in blue.*

@n Switch the y-axis back and forth between `Linear` and `Logarithmic`. What do you think is happening here? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Keep the y-axis `Linear` and change the x-axis to `Logarithmic`. What happens to the graph? Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The linear graph looks exponential!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The x-values are still growing linearly, but with the x-_intervals_ growing exponentially it appears to go "right" more slowly than it goes "up".}}

@star Now change _both_ the x-axis and the y-axis to `Logarithmic`. What happens to the graph? Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line appears linear!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Since the intervals are growing at identical rates, the "squish" and the "stretch" cancel each other out.}}
