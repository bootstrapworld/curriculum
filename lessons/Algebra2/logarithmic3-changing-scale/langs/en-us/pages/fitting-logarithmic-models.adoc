- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

== Fitting a Logarithmic Model @hspace{2em} __f(x) = a log~b~ x + k__
@link-instructions{You should be on *Slide 7: Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models (Desmos)*.}

@n List the numbers labeling the x-axis tick marks from smallest to largest: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{50000, 100000, 150000, 200000}}

@n What kind of growth does the sequence you just wrote show (circle one): @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{linear} @hspace{2em} quadratic @hspace{2em} exponential

@n Use the sliders for @math{a} and @math{k} to make the best-fitting logarithmic model you can find. Write it below. _(Note: Pyret's `log` always uses @math{b = 10})_

@n Modify `logarithmic(x)` in the @starter-file{alg2-countries} to define this model, and fit it using `fit-model`.

== Scaling the x-Axis

- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *Open the "Graph Settings" window.*
- *Expand the "More Options" section* by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#).
- *Change the x-axis scale* from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`.
@scrub{
- *Open the `Data Table` folder on the left side of the screen by clicking on the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#)*
- Scroll down to bottom of the table and find the magnifying glass ([.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}#) that appears to the bottom left.
- Click on the magnifying glass to resize/rescale the graph to make all of the points in the table visible on the graph.

@n What is the shape of the point cloud, after changing the @math{x} scale to `Logarithmic`?  @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{Linear} @hspace{3em} Quadratic @hspace{3em} Exponential

@n List the numbers labeling the x-axis tick marks from smallest to largest: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{100, 1000, @math{10^4}, @math{10^5}}}

@n What kind of growth does the sequence you just wrote show (circle one): @hspace{2em} linear @hspace{2em} quadratic @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{exponential}

@n Adjust the sliders for @math{a} and @math{k} to improve the model. _Toggle back and forth between `logarithmic` and `linear` x-axis scales as you work._

@n In Pyret, define `logarithmic2(x)` to match this model.  Then use the `fit-model` function to find its @vocab{S-value}: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{less than 5 }}

@n How will predictions made using `logarithmic2` compare to predictions made using `logarithmic`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They will be significantly better!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Do we know for sure that either of these models is optimal? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No! We just did our best using our eyes.}}

@n Why does transforming the *x-axis* makes our data look linear? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary: The data is growing logarithmically}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and by transforming the x-axis exponentially, it can keep up with the growth. We're inverting the data. }} +
