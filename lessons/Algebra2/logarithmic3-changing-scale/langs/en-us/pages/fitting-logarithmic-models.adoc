- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

For this page, you'll need to have *Slide 6: Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models (Desmos)* and @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer.
}

== Fitting a Logarithmic Model @hspace{2em} __f(x) = a log~b~ x + k__

@n The intervals on the x-axis are increasing: @hspace{6em} @ifsoln-choice{Linearly} @hspace{6em} Quadratically @hspace{6em} Exponentially

@n Use the sliders for @math{a} and @math{k} to create the best-fitting logarithmic model you can find. Write it below. _(Note: In Pyret, `log` always uses @math{b = 10}!)_

[cols="^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]

@math{\text{logarithmic}(x) = }
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{9}}{log coefficient (a)}@math{\log_{10}(x) + }
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{65}}{vertical shift (k)}
@hspace{3em}
@show{(code '(define (logarithmic x) (+ (* (?ANS 9) (log x)) (?ANS 65))))}

@indented{@teacher{Definitions will vary as students will be fitting the curve by eye! Numbers below are provided as a reference.}}


@n Modify `logarithmic(x)` in the @starter-file{alg2-countries} to define this model, and fit it using `fit-model`.

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
The error in the model is described by an @math{S-value} of about 
@fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{5.14   }}{S}
@fitbruby{4em}{@ifsoln{years}}{units}, which is 
@fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{significant  }}{insignificant / reasonable / significant / extreme} considering that
@fitbruby{14em}{@ifsoln{median life-expectancy}}{y-variable} in this dataset ranges from 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{52.1}}{lowest y-value} to 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{85.5}}{highest y-value}.

}

== Scaling the x-Axis

- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *Open the "Graph Settings" window.*
- *Expand the "More Options" section* by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#).
- *Change the x-axis scale* from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`.
- *Open the `Data Table` folder on the left side of the screen by clicking on the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#)*
- Scroll down to bottom of the table and find the magnifying glass ([.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}#) that appears to the bottom left.
- Click on the magnifying glass to resize/rescale the graph to make all of the points in the table visible on the graph.

@n What is the shape of the point cloud, after changing the @math{x} scale to `Logarithmic`?  @hspace{2em} @ifsoln-choice{Linear} @hspace{3em} Quadratic @hspace{3em} Exponential

@n Now the intervals on the x-axis are increasing: @hspace{15em} @ifsoln-choice{Linearly} @hspace{3em} Quadratically @hspace{3em} Exponentially

@n Adjust the sliders for @math{a} and @math{k} to improve the model. _Toggle back and forth between `logarithmic` and `linear` x-axis scales as you work._

@hspace{1em} @ifsoln{MAYBE @hspace{1em}}
@show{(code '(define (logarithmic2 x) (+ (* (?ANS 11.7 ) (log x)) (?ANS 60))))}

@n Modify the definition of `logarithmic2(x)` in Pyret to match this model.  Then use the `fit-model` function to find its @vocab{S-value}: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{less than 5 }}

@n How will predictions made using `logarithmic2` compare to predictions made using `logarithmic`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They will be significantly better!}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Do we know for sure that either of these models is optimal? Explain. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No! We just did our best using our eyes.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Why does transforming the *x-axis* makes our data look linear? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary: The data is growing logarithmically}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and by transforming the x-axis exponentially, it can keep up with the growth. We're inverting the data. We're warping the scatter plot so the dots looks straight.}}  +
