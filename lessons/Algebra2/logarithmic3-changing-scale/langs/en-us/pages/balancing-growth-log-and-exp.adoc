- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

== Balancing Logarithmic Growth

- The folder for a logarithmic function @math{g} is shown in red, and the folder for @math{h} is "turned off". *Do not* turn it on yet!
- Both the x- and y-axis should be labeled with a sequence of numbers _(e.g. 0, 2, 4, 6 ...)_.

@n What kind of growth do the sequences on these axes show? (circle one) @hspace{6em}
@ifsoln-choice{Linear} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 					@hspace{1em}
Exponential 				@hspace{1em}
Logarithmic

@n The function @math{g} is @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{Logarithmic}}{Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, or Logarithmic}, and its base is @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{10}}. @hspace{1em} Which two points are plotted on @math{g}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{(1, 2)} and @math{(10, 4)}}}

@vspace{1ex}

- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *open the "Graph Settings" window.*

@n The x-axis goes from @fitb{2.5em}{@ifsoln{~ -40}} ≤ @math{x} ≤ @fitb{2.5em}{@ifsoln{~ 40}}. Can you change these numbers to make @math{g} look linear? @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{No}} Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No, because logarithms}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{grow more slowly than linear functions. As long as the axis scales are linear, a logarithmic curve stays curved .}}

@vspace{1ex}

- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) and change the *x-axis* from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`

@n Did our two points on the line change? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{No}} @hspace{1em} How did the graph change? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It turned straight! It looks linear!}} + 

@n What is going on here? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We "squished" the x-axis exponentially, which balanced out the logarithmic growth on the y-axis}} +

@n *Make a prediction:* What would the graph of @math{g} look like with a `Linear` *x-axis* a `Logarithmic` *y-axis*? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Try it out! Was your prediction accurate? @fitb{2em}{}. @hspace{1em} What happened, and why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The curve got "sharper". }} + 
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{By "squishing" the y-axis, we only made the logarithmic growth appear stronger (it looks like we took the "log of the log!)")}}

== Balancing Exponential Growth

- Set the scale for both axes back to `Linear`
- "Turn off" the folder for @math{g}, and "turn on" the folder for our exponential function @math{h}

@n The function @math{h} is @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{Exponential}}{Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, or Logarithmic}, and its base is @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{2}}.  @hspace{1em} Which two points are plotted on @math{h}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{(1, 2)} and @math{(2, 4)}}}

@n Without switching either axis to `Logarithmic`, can we change the minimum and maximum @math{x} or @math{y} to make @math{h} look `Linear`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No}}

@n *Make a prediction:* Which axis should we switch to `Logarithmic`, in order to make @math{h} look `Linear`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We should switch the y-axis}}

@n Try it out! Was your prediction accurate? @fitb{2em}{}. @hspace{1em} What happened, and why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We "squished" the y-axis exponentially, which balanced out}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the exponential growth of @math{h}}} 

@vspace{1ex}

- Change the *y-axis* back to `Linear`, and change the x-axis to `Logarithmic`

@n What happened to the graph of @math{h}, and why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The curve got "sharper". By "squishing" the x-axis, we only made the exponential growth}} + 
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{appear stronger (it looks like we took the "exponent of the exponent!)")}}

@star Desmos has two choices for scale: 

- `Linear` _(each interval is the same size as the one before it)_ 
- `Logarithmic` _(each interval is 10x larger than the one before it)_

If we wanted to make @math{h} appear linear *using the x-axis*, what kind of scale would we need? @fitb{}{}
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The intervals on the x-axis would need to get _smaller_ by a factor of 10 to cancel out the exponential growth of @math{h}}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It would probably be called an `Exponential` scale.}}
