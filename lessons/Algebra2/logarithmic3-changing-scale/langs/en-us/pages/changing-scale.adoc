- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

For this page, you'll need to have *Slide 5: Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models (Desmos)* and @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer.

== Fitting a Logarithmic Model @hspace{2em} __f(x) = a log~b~ x + k__

@ifnotsoln{@vspace{1ex}} 

*Open the `Data Table` folder by clicking on the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#)*

- @math{x_1} is the per-capita income for each country in thousands of $US, and @math{y_1} is the median lifespan.
- Next to @math{y_1} you'll see a dark circle with spots ([.desmosbutton]#{points}#) inside. If the circle is dark, that means that those points are visible on our graph. Click the circle to "turn off" those dots, then click it again to turn them back on.
- Move the graph by clicking and dragging the background.
- Notice that a magnifying glass ([.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}#) appears to the bottom left of the table. (You may have to scroll down to see the bottom of the table!) Clicking on the magnifying glass resizes/rescales the graph to fit all the points in the table.

@n Write the numbers you see along the x-axis, from left to right: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This will vary depending on zoom level}} +
@hspace{1em}Continue this pattern - what would the next three numbers be? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This will vary depending on zoom level}}

@n Circle the type of function that describes this pattern: @hspace{6em} @ifsoln-choice{Linear} @hspace{6em} Quadratic @hspace{6em} Exponential

@n Move the sliders for @math{a} and @math{c} to create the best-fitting logarithmic model you can find, and write it below.

@hspace{1em} _Note: The Bootstrap Pyret function `log` always uses @math{b = 10}._

@n Modify `logarithmic(x)` in @starter-file{alg2-countries} to define this model, and fit it using `fit-model`. 

@indented{
The error in the model is described by an @math{S-value} of about 
@fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{5.14   }}{S}
@fitbruby{4em}{@ifsoln{years}}{units}, which is 
@fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{significant  }}{insignificant / reasonable / significant / extreme} considering 
@fitbruby{14em}{@ifsoln{median life-expectancy}}{y-variable} in this dataset ranges from 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{52.1}}{lowest y-value} to 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{85.5}}{highest y-value}.

}

== Scaling the x-Axis

- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *Open the "Graph Settings" window.*
- *Expand the "More Options" section* by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#).
- *Change the x-axis scale* from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`.
- Adjust the view by zooming and dragging the graph to get all of the points in view on the screen and filling most of it.

@n What is the shape of the point cloud _now,_ after changing the scale?  @hspace{1em} @ifsoln-choice{Linear} @hspace{6em} Quadratic @hspace{6em} Exponential

@n Write the numbers you see along the x-axis, from left to right: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This will vary depending on zoom level}} +
@hspace{1em}Continue this pattern - what would the next three numbers be? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This will vary depending on zoom level}}

@n Circle the type of function that describes this pattern: @hspace{6.5em} Linear @hspace{6em} Quadratic @hspace{6em} @ifsoln-choice{Exponential}

@n Adjust the sliders for @math{a} and @math{c} to improve the model. _Toggle back and forth between `logarithmic` and `linear` x-axis scales as you work._ + 
@ifnotsoln{@hspace{1em}When you are satisfied with your model, record both forms of the definition below.}

@n Modify the definition of `logarithmic2(x)` in Pyret to match this model. Use the `fit-model` function to find its @vocab{S-value}: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{less than 5 }}

@n Why do you think transforming the *x-axis* makes our data look linear? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary: The data is growing logarithmically}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and by transforming the x-axis exponentially, it can keep up with the growth. We're inverting the data. We're warping the scatter plot so the dots looks straight.}}  +
