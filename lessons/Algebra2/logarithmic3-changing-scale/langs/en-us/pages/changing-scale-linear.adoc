- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

== Lines and Intervals
@link-instructions{
Make sure you're on *Slide 5: Changing the Scale (Linear)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models*.
}

- On the x-axis (black numbers), you'll see a sequence of numbers showing the intervals (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) 

@n What kind of growth does the sequence on the x-axis show? (circle one) @hspace{2em}
@ifsoln-choice{Linearly} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

@n What kind of growth does the sequence on the y-axis show? (circle one) @hspace{2em}
@ifsoln-choice{Linearly} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

@n _Relative to the x-intervals,_ the y-intervals grow (circle one): @hspace{3.5em} 
@ifsoln-choice{Linearly} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

@n The function @math{f} is (circle one): @hspace{18em}
@ifsoln-choice{Linear}			@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 						@hspace{1em}
Exponential 					@hspace{1em}
Logarithmic

@n _Relative to the x-values,_ @math{f(x)} grows (circle one): @hspace{8.5em} 
@ifsoln-choice{Linearly} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

== Changing the Scale of @math{y}
- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *open the "Graph Settings" window.*
- *Expand the "More Options" section* by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#).
- *Change the y-axis* scale from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`, and close the settings window by clicking on the graph.

@n Now, the intervals on the *y-axis* (black numbers) grow @fitbruby{35em}{@ifsoln{Exponentially}}{Linearly, Quadratically, Exponentially, or Logarithmically}.

@n _For each increase along the x-intervals_, the y-intervals grow (circle one): @hspace{8.5em} 
Linearly 						@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Exponentially}	@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

@n What happened to the graph of @math{f}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{it turned into a logarithmic curve!}}

@n Why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{With y-intervals growing exponentially relative to x-intervals, the straight line wound up curving towards the x-axis making it appear linear!}} +
@fitb{}{}
@fitb{}{}

== Changing the Scale of @math{x}
- Return to the "Graph Settings" window, make the _x-axis_ `Linear` and make the _y-axis_ `Logarithmic`. 

@n Now, the intervals on the *x-axis* (black numbers) grow @fitbruby{35em}{@ifsoln{Exponentially}}{Linearly, Quadratically, Exponentially, or Logarithmically}.

@n _For each increase along the x-intervals_, the y-intervals grow (circle one): @hspace{2em} 
Linearly				 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Logarithmically}

@n What happened to the graph of @math{f}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{it turned into an exponential curve!}}

@n Why do you think that happened? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{With the y-intervals growing more slowly, the line curves up to the y-axis}} +
@fitb{}{}

== Changing the Scale of @math{x} and @math{y}
- Return to the "Graph Settings" window, and make _both_ axes `Logarithmic`. 

@n _For each increase along the x-intervals_, the y-intervals grow (circle one): @hspace{2em} 
@ifsoln-choice{Linearly}		@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

@n What happened to the graph of @math{f}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{it stayed linear!}}

@n Why do you think that happened? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It goes back to being linear! With both intervals growing at the same rate relative to one another,}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a straight line stays straight.}}
