  "Graph" tables provide a pure-CSS solution for all coordinate planes.

  They rely on a set up CSS variables, with reasonable defaults:
    --width and --height determine the size of plane. Defaults to 3in x 3x.
    --min-gap determines the minimum space between graphs. Defaults to 20px.

    --top_pct and --left_pct determine the origin's position (btw 0 and 1). Defaults to (0.5, 0.5).
    --minors determines how many "minor axes" (incl the one behind major). Defaults to 7.

    --x_label defaults to 'x'
    --y_label defaults to 'y'

- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

@n The function @math{f} is @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{Linear}}{Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, or Logarithmic}, and its slope is @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{2}}. @hspace{1em} Which two points are plotted on @math{f}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{(0, 0)} and @math{(1, 2)}}}

- Draw @math{f} in the graph on the left.
- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *open the "Graph Settings" window.*
- *Change the scale of the y-axis* so that @math{-5 ≤ y ≤ 5}.
- Draw @math{f} in the graph on the right.

@blanklines{2}{
The line looks steeper. The graph *looks* like it changed because we changed the scale, but all we did was "stretch" the y-axis
}

@n *Without changing the y-axis*, we can make @math{f} look like it does in the original graph by *changing scale on the x-axis* to @hspace{1em} @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{~ -4}} ≤ @math{x} ≤ @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{~ 4}}

- *Change the y-axis* scale from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`. _(The y-axis labels should change to something like 0.1, 1, 10, 100...)_
- *Drag the graph* to make sure you can see both labeled points
