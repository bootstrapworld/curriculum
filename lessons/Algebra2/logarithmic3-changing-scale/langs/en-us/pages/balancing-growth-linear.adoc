////
- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

@include{fragments/desmos.adoc}

@link-instructions{
Make sure you're on *Slide 5: Changing the Scale (Linear)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models*.
}

- Both the x- and y-axis are labeled with a sequence of numbers _(e.g. 0, 2, 4, 6 ...)_. 

@n What kind of growth do the sequences on these axes show? (circle one) @hspace{6em}
@ifsoln-choice{Linear} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 					@hspace{1em}
Exponential 				@hspace{1em}
Logarithmic

@n The function @math{f} is @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{Linear}}{Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, or Logarithmic}, and its slope is @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{2}}. @hspace{1em} Which two points are plotted on @math{f}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{(0, 0)} and @math{(1, 2)}}}

== Faking a Change in Slope

- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *open the "Graph Settings" window.*
- *Change the scale of the y-axis* so that @math{-2 ≤ y ≤ 2}

@n What kind of growth does the sequence of numbers on the *y-axis* show _now?_ @hspace{3em}
@ifsoln-choice{Linear} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 					@hspace{1em}
Exponential 				@hspace{1em}
Logarithmic

@n Did our two points on the line change? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{No}} @hspace{1em} Did the slope of @math{f} change? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{No}}. @hspace{1em} How did the graph change? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line looks steeper.}} + 
@fitb{}{}

@n What is going on here? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The graph *looks* like it changed because we changed the scale, but all we did was "stretch" the y-axis}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n *Without changing the y-axis*, change the _x-axis_ to put the line roughly back where it was. What scale did you use? @hspace{1em} @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{~ -4}} ≤ @math{x} ≤ @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{~ 4}}

== Faking a Change to Logarithmic

- Open the "Graph Settings" window, and *expand the "More Options" section* by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#).
- *Change the y-axis* scale from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`. _(The y-axis labels should change to something like 0.1, 1, 10, 100...)_

@n What kind of growth does the sequence of numbers on the *y-axis* show _now?_ @hspace{3em}
Linear 						@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 					@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Exponential} @hspace{1em}
Logarithmic

@n Did our two points on the line change? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{No}} @hspace{1em} Did the slope of @math{f} change? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{No}}. @hspace{1em} How did the graph change? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It looks logarithmic!}} + 
@fitb{}{}

@n What is going on here? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We "squished" the y-axis exponentially, which made the linear growth of @math{f} appear logarithmic}} +
@fitb{}{}

== Faking a Change to Exponential

- Change the y-axis scale back to `Linear`, and the `x-axis` scale to `Logarithmic`.

@n What kind of growth does the sequence of numbers on the *x-axis* show _now?_ @hspace{2em}
Linear 						@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 					@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Exponential} @hspace{1em}
Logarithmic

@n Did our two points on the line change? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{No}}. @hspace{1em} Did the slope of @math{f} change? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{No}}. @hspace{1em} How did the graph change? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It looks exponential!}} + 
@fitb{}{}

@n What is going on here? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{We "squished" the x-axis exponentially, which made the linear growth of @math{f} appear exponential}} +
@fitb{}{}

@star *Make a prediction:* What do you think will happen if _both axes_ are switched to `Logarithmic`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{answers will vary...}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Change both scales to `Logarithmic`. Was your prediction accurate? @fitb{2em}{}. @hspace{1em} What happened, and why? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We "squished" both axes exponentially, so they balanced each other out and `f(x)` looks like a straight line.}} +
@fitb{}{}
