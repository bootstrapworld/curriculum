- Import Desmos Styles
-
- This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
- which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
-
- It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
- to style all demos glyphs
-
- Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
- {points}
- {caret}
- {magnifying}
- {wrench}
-
- Here's an example of using these:
- This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

== Changing the Scale for a Logarithmic Function

Make sure you're on *Slide 6: Changing Scale (Exponential and Logarithmic)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models*.

- The function @math{g} is shown in blue, and the function @math{f} is "turned off". *Do not* turn it on yet!

@n The function @math{g} is (circle one): @hspace{17em}
Linear							@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 						@hspace{1em}
Exponential 					@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Logarithmic}

@n _Relative to the x-intervals,_ the y-intervals grow (circle one): @hspace{3em} 
@ifsoln-choice{Linearly} 		@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

- Click on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the Desmos graph to *open the "Graph Settings" window.*
- *Expand the "More Options" section* by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#).
- *Change the x-axis* scale from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`, and close the settings window by clicking on the graph.

@n _Now_ the intervals on the *x-axis* (black numbers) grow (circle one): @hspace{2em}
Linearly 						@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Exponentially} 	@hspace{1em}
Logarithmically

@n _Relative to the x-intervals,_ the y-intervals grow (circle one): @hspace{3em} 
Linearly 						@hspace{1em}
Quadratically 					@hspace{1em}
Exponentially 					@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Logarithmically}

@n What happened to the graph of @math{g}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{it turned linear!}}

@n Why do you think that happened? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The exponential growth of the x-intervals cancelled out the logarithmic growth of the @math{g},}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{making it appear linear}} +

- Return to the "Graph Settings" window, make the _x-axis_ linear and make the _y-axis_ logarithmic. 

@n _Now_ the intervals on the *y-axis* (black numbers) grow  (circle one): @hspace{2em}
Linearly 						@hspace{1em}

@n What happened to the graph of @math{g}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The curve got "sharper"}}

@n Why do you think that happened? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The squishing the y-axis exponentially only made the}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{logarithmic curve grow more slowly ("the log of the log")}}

@star Desmos forces us to choose between `Linear` and `Logarithmic` scales. If we wanted to make @math{g} appear linear *using the y-axis* we hat kind of scale would we need? @fitb{}{}
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{If we could make y shift to exponential scale, that would cancel out the logarithmic growth of @math{g}}}

== Changing the Scale for an Exponential Function
- Return to the "Graph Settings" window, make both axes `Linear`. 
- "Turn off" the function @math{g}, and "turn on" function @math{h} so you see it graphed in green.

@n The function @math{h} is (circle one): @hspace{2em}
Linear							@hspace{1em}
Quadratic 						@hspace{1em}
@ifsoln-choice{Exponential}		@hspace{1em}
Logarithmic

@n We want to make the graph of @math{h} appear linear. Which axis should we change to `Logarithmic` (x or y)? @fitb{}{the y-axis}

- Try it out! Did you guess correctly?

@star Desmos forces us to choose between `Linear` and `Logarithmic` scales. What kind of scale would we need, if we wanted to make @math{h} appear linear using the _other_ axis? @fitb{}{}
