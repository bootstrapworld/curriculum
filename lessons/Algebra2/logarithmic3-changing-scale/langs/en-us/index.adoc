@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. + 
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first two slides. _(As the lesson progresses you will be directed to adjust the pacing or sync students to you so that they have access to relevant slides.)_
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- This lesson assumes that students have been introduced to logarithms before, and are familiar with computation involving logarithmic functions.
- The focus of this lesson is about _applications_ of log functions, and builds an intuition for logarithmic computation by motivating substantial trial and error.

== Plotting and Transforming Logarithmic Sequences

=== Overview
Students plot a logarithmic sequence as points on a number line, and explore how changing the intervals to grow exponentially appears to "linearize" the points.

=== Launch


=== Investigate


=== Synthesize


== Fitting by Changing Scale
@objective{model-fit-function}

=== Overview
Students take what they've learned about changing the scale in one dimension, and apply it to their scatter plots of income v. lifespan.

=== Launch

@teacher{Sync or pace students to *Slide 5: Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models Desmos file*, and open @starter-file{alg2-countries}.
- You should now be on the Slide 5: "Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)".
- Use it to complete the first section of @printable-exercise{changing-scale.adoc}.

@QandA{
@Q{What values did you come up with for @math{a} and @math{c} in your best-guess logarithmic model?}
@A{Record different students' responses for @math{a} and @math{c} on the board.}
@Q{How do your @math{a} and @math{c} values compare with those of other students'? Are they very similar or very different?}
@Q{What were the @math{S} values for these models?}

@slidebreak

Trial-and-error only gets us so far, and it's not clear that we would ever stumble upon the optimal model. 

*We need something like Pyret's `lr-plot`, which uses computational methods to find the optimal model.*

Unfortunately, `lr-plot` only finds _linear_ models in data with _linear_ relationships.

Data Scientists often use transformations to stretch their data into shapes that are easier to work with, and then reverse the transformation when they are done. If only we could _transform_ this data to make it appear linear. Then we could use `lr-plot` to fit the optimal model, and then reverse the transformation to get the optimal logarithmic model!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Imagine that the scatter plot is printed on a sheet of rubber, and can be stretched or squashed in any way we want... 
- With that image in mind, follow the directions on the last section of @printable-exercise{changing-scale.adoc}.

@teacher{
Students will be switching the x-axis of their graph from linear to logarithmic in this section. Make sure they are toggling back and forth between the two views as they look for the best-fitting model.

@QandA{
@Q{A person running on a treadmill doesn't change location. Why not?}
@A{Their forward movement is balanced by the backwards movement of the treadmill.}
@Q{If they run faster and faster, what needs to happen to the treadmill to keep them in the same place?}
@A{The treadmill needs to go faster as well. As long as the treadmill speed increases at the same rate as the runner, they will balance one another's growth.}
@Q{How is the treadmill example comparable to what we've done with our x-axis transformation?}
@A{We are speeding up the growth intervals on the x-axis to "keep up with" the speed of growth in the data so that we can see the pattern better.}
}

When we changed Desmos's view from "Linear" to "Logarithmic", we made the x-axis grow faster and "squish" the dots so they appear linear. By _transforming the x-axis_ to grow exponentially, we are squashing the coordinate plane so that each interval on the x-axis represents 10x the growth in `pc-gdp` as the one before it. This balances out the logarithmic growth in `median-lifespan`, and warps our logarithmic model so the curved looks like linear.

@strategy{Undoing a Log by taking the...Log?}{

Relationships in our scatter plot represent a _ratio of growth_ between two quantities. Consider a simple ratio like 1:3. This means the first quantity grows by one third _with respect to the other_. It can by turned into 1:1 in two ways:

1. Transform the *first* quantity (_multiply_ by 3)
2. Transform the *second* quantity (_divide_ by 3)

In our scatter plot, the ratio is the growth in `median-lifespan` v. the growth in `pc-gdp`. The growth of one is logarithmic _with respect to the growth of the other_. This means there are two ways to linearize the data:

1. Transform the *x-axis* to match the *y* (take the _log_)
2. Transform the *y-axis* to match the *x* (raise to an _exponent_)

We've chosen the first option because _Desmos doesn't offer an exponential transformation of the axes_. There's no way to even let kids experiment, without jumping straight to Pyret! Another reason is that the range of the `median-lifespan` data is so small (52-85 years) relative to the range of `pc-gdp` (600-144,000 dollars) that the transformation has less of an effect on the y-axis than it does on the x-axis!

While the treadmill/ratio analogy doesn't cover inverses in any real depth, the treadmill analogy opens the door to discussing how one kind of change can "cancel out" or "undo" another. We are working to add additional material on inverse functions to our Algebra 2 materials, and hope to release them in the coming year!

=== Synthesize

- How does seeing the point cloud as linear help us think about logarithmic growth?
- Transforming the axes only makes things _look_ linear - the actual points haven't changed at all, and we still can't use linear regression to find the best logarithmic model... Can you think of a way we could transform the _data_, instead of the axes?

@slidebreak

Linear regression allows us to find the *computationally optimal model*, not just a model that "fit really well."

@QandA{
@Q{In this project, do we know whether or not our model is the _best?_}
@A{We _do_ know!}
@Q{How do you know?}
@A{By linearizing the data and applying linear regression, we were able to find the optimal model for the transformed dataset. When the transformation is reversed, the optimal linear model becomes the optimal logarithmic one.}
