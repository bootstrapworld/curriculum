== More Relationships

Pyret allows us to generate many scatter plots, quite quickly! Take advantage of that to identify two relationships that appear to be strong. _Hint: If you're working in the Interactions Area of Pyret, you can hit the up arrow to bring back previously used lines of code._

@n There appears to be a @fitbruby{7em}{}{negative / positive} relationship between @fitbruby{12em}{}{explanatory variable (x-axis)} and @fitbruby{12em}{}{response variable (y-axis)}.
