== Part 1

@n What columns do you think might be related to one another? +
_e.g. is the number of veterans related to the amount of land-area? Is the population in 2010 related to the population in 2020?_ 

@hspace{1em} +a.+ I think that @fitb{20em}{} might have a positive relationship with @fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +b.+ I think that @fitb{20em}{} might have a negative relationship with @fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +c.+ I think that @fitb{20em}{} might have a relationship with @fitb{}{}

@n Put an "*S*" in front of the relationships you expect to be strong. Put a "*W*" in front of the relationships you expect to be weak.

== Part 2

@center{@show{(contract 'scatter-plot '("Table" (labels String) (explanatory String) (response String)) "Image")}}

@n Use the Contract above to make a scatter-plot for the *first relationship* you wrote above. (Use `"state"` as the label, so that clicking on a point will show you which state you're looking at.)

@hspace{1em} +a.+ If there's a pattern in this scatter-plot, what does that mean? If there isn't, what does _that_ mean? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +b.+ In your own words, describe the pattern you see in the scatter plot so someone else could sketch it. @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}



@n Make a scatter-plot for the *second relationship* you wrote.

@hspace{1em} +a.+ If there's a pattern in this scatter-plot, what does that mean? If there isn't, what does _that_ mean? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +b.+ In your own words, describe the pattern you see in the scatter plot so someone else could sketch it. @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Make a scatter-plot for the *third relationship* you wrote.

@hspace{1em} +a.+ If there's a pattern in this scatter-plot, what does that mean? If there isn't, what does _that_ mean? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +b.+ In your own words, describe the pattern you see in the scatter plot so someone else could sketch it. @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}
