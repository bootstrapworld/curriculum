2+| What do you predict the relationships will look like? (_e.g. Negative? Positive? Curves?_)
2+| Label the axes on each of the graphs below with the variables you wrote in 1 and 2 and then make a sketch of how you imagine they might be related.

2+| Use the Contract above to make a scatter plot for each relationship. _(Use `"state"` as the label, so that clicking on a point will show you which state you're looking at.)_

2+| If there's a pattern in the scatter plot, describe it so that someone else could sketch it. What does the pattern mean? If there isn't a pattern, what does _that_ mean?
