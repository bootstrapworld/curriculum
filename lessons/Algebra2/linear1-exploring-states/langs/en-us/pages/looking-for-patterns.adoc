== More Relationships

Pyret allows us to generate many scatter plots, quite quickly! Take advantage of that to identify two relationships that appear to be strong. _Hint: If you're working in the Interactions Area of Pyret, you can hit the up arrow to bring back previously used lines of code._

@n There appears to be a @fitbruby{8em}{}{negative / positive} relationship between @fitbruby{15em}{}{explanatory variable (x-axis)} and @fitbruby{}{}{response variable (y-axis)}

@n There appears to be a @fitbruby{8em}{}{negative / positive} relationship between @fitbruby{15em}{}{explanatory variable (x-axis)} and @fitbruby{}{}{response variable (y-axis)}

@star What have you learned about our state and the others we decided to focus on?
