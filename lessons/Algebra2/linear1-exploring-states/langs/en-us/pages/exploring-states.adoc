== Describing Income

@n Identify the two states with the lowest *median* income and complete the table below with their information.
_Hint: You could make a table to help you answer this question! If you need a refresher on how to use `count`, `first-n-rows`, and `sort`, you'll find them in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Pages}!_

}

@n Would a model built from two states with low `median-income` be likely to fit the data well? Why or Why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No! This is a particular subset of the data with shared characteristics (also called a grouped sample)}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and is unlikely to be representative of the pattern in the full dataset.}}


@n Why do states typically have higher `median-income` than `per-capita income`? @fitb{}{} +

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because per capita income divides the total earnings of the state by all of the people living in it, including children, retirees, and unemployed individuals. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Median household income compares the money earned by household. Households can have anywhere from 1 person to many people living in them. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There might not be anyone in a household who earns an income, or there could be multiple adults earning an income.}}

== Definitions in the Code

_The two lines of code under `# Define some rows` extract rows 0 and 1 from the table, and define them as `alabama` and `alaska`._

@n Type `alabama` into the Interactions Area. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just the Row for Alabama}}

@n Underneath the definition of those rows, *add new definitions* for `california`, `michigan`, and one other state. Click "Run", so that Pyret reads your new definitions and test them out in the Interactions Area to make sure you defined them correctly!

@star Add any additional Notices or Wonderings you have about this dataset to the table at the top.
