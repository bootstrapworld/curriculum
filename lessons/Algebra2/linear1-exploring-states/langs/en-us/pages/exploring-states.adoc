== Describing Income

@n Find the two states with the lowest *median* income and complete the table below with their information.

@indented{
[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===
|State                  | Median Household Income        | Per-capita Income
| @ifsoln{Mississippi}  | @ifsoln{39031}                 | @ifsoln{20618} @ifnotsoln{@vspace{2ex}}
| @ifsoln{Arkansas}     | @ifsoln{40768}                 | @ifsoln{22170} @ifnotsoln{@vspace{2ex}}

}

@n Would a model built from two states with low `median-income` be likely to fit the rest of the data well? Why or Why not?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No! This is a particular subset of the data with shared characteristics (also called a grouped sample)}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and is unlikely to be representative of the pattern in the full dataset.}}


@n Why do you think states typically have higher `median-income` than `per-capita income`? @fitb{}{} +

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because per capita income divides the total earnings of the state by all of the people living in it, including children, retirees, and unemployed individuals. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Median household income compares the money earned by household. Households can have anywhere from 1 person to many people living in them. }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There might not be anyone in a household who earns an income, or there could be multiple adults earning an income.}}

== Definitions in the Code

_The two lines of code under `# Define some rows` extract rows 0 and 1 from the table, and define them as `alabama` and `alaska`._

@n Type `alabama` into the Interactions Area. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just the Row for Alabama}}

@n Underneath the definition of those rows, *add new definitions* for `california`, `michigan`, and one other state. Click "Run", so that Pyret reads your new definitions and test them out in the Interactions Area to make sure you defined them correctly!

@star Add any additional Notices or Wonderings you have about this dataset to the table at the top.
