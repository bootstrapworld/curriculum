= Exploring Quadratic Relationships

@description{Students investigate linear relationships in demographic data about TBD, using an inquiry-based model of sense-making, hypothesizing, modeling and testing. They are introduced to table transformations and inverse functions, which are used to fit linear models onto nonlinear data.}

* Describe correlations as Strong, Moderate, or Weak
* Model linear relationships using quadratic functions

| Student-facing Lesson Goals

== TBD @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the @online-exercise{TBD, TBD Starter File}, and create scatter plots to search for relationships between columns. They share and discuss their findings with the class.

[.lesson-instruction]
- @online-exercise{TBD, TBD Starter File}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{exploring-TBD.adoc}.


=== Synthesize

- Have students discuss their findings. What did they Notice? What did they Wonder?
- Invite students to share their scatter-plots with one another (copying and pasting scatter plot displays into a shared document, for example, and then labeling those displays).
- Did they find any correlations in the dataset?
- What was their @vocab{form}? Were any of them linear? Were any of them non-linear?
- Were any correlations strong? Weak?


== Quadratic Models

=== Overview
Students discover the limitations of linear models, and explore the behavior of quadratic functions.

== Fitting Nonlinear Models @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students learn to transform the data into a linear shape, building a new column by applying a function to each row. This new data can be fit with a linear model. By applying the _inverse_ of this transformation to their linear model, they retrieve the quadratic model.
