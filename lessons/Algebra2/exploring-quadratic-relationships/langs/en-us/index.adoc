= Exploring Quadratic Relationships

@description{Students investigate linear relationships in demographic data about Fuel Efficiency, using an inquiry-based model of sense-making, hypothesizing, modeling and testing. They are introduced to table transformations and inverse functions, which are used to fit linear models onto nonlinear data.}

== Exploring Fuel Efficiency @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1RESEiKCepBRV3_AbthDydHaq5b9BN2zy, Fuel Efficiency Starter File}, and create scatter plots to search for relationships between columns. They share and discuss their findings with the class, discovering the limitations of linear models.

- Are some cars more fuel efficient than others?
- If car A is more fuel efficient than car B, does that mean that it _always_ gets better mileage than be?
- Gas is expensive! Are there speeds that are more efficient than others?

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open the @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1RESEiKCepBRV3_AbthDydHaq5b9BN2zy, Fuel Efficiency Starter File}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{exploring-fuel-efficiency.adoc}.

Review student answers:

- Did you see a pattern or relationship in this dataset?
- If so, what is its @vocab{form}? Is it linear? Non-linear?
- Is the correlation strong? Weak?
- What linear models did you try to fit? What kind of @math{R^2} did you get?

By now you've tried to fit quite a few linear models to this data, and we're not getting anywhere!

@right{@image{images/fuel-efficiency-linear1.png}} We can build linear models that fit the "increasing" half of the data...

@right{@image{images/fuel-efficiency-linear2.png}} We can build linear models that fit the "decreasing" half of the data...

@right{@image{images/fuel-efficiency-linear3.png}} We can build linear models that try to split the difference...

...but all of them are so far away from so many points, and our @math{R^2} is pretty dismal.

== Quadratic Models @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to quadratic models, and extend the sampling techniques from the linear models lesson into quadratic relationships.

=== Launch

Linear models are great for fitting simple relationships. But the real world isn't so simple, and more often than not linear models are just too primitive to handle that complexity.

Relationships that look like _arches_ (they rise and fall, or fall and rise) are called @vocab{quadratic relationships}. In a quadratic model, we have up to _three_ terms that can be played with:

- *Constant term* - just as in linear models, this is the value when @math{x} is zero (e.g. - the y-intercept of the graph).
- *Linear term* - this describes the amount of variation in @math{y} that is directly proportional to @math{x} (e.g. - the slope, or the amount computed by multiplying a coefficient by @math{x}).
- *Quadratic term* - this describes the amount of variation in @math{y} that is directly proportional to @math{x^2} (e.g. - the amount computed by multiplying a coefficient by @math{x^2}).

Having three terms to play with means we can build in a lot more complexity into our model!

=== Synthesize

* What was the highest @math{R^2} you were able to get?
* What model was that?
* Could a quadratic model be used to fit a linear relationship?
** YES! If the coefficient of the quadratic term is zero, it's equivalent to a linear model.

== Fitting Nonlinear Models @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students learn to transform the data into a linear shape, building a new column by applying a function to each row. This new data can be fit with a linear model. By applying the _inverse_ of this transformation to their linear model, they retrieve the quadratic model.
