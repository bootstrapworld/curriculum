@n What do you *Notice* about the data in the table? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Time keeps going up, but altitude goes up and down, over and over. Altitude goes from}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{5 feet to 205 feet, then back down and up again. It takes 30m for the altitude to return to the high or low point}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n What do you *Wonder*? @fitb{}{} +

@n The ride goes from @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{5}}{lowest point}feet to @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{205}}{highest point}feet in @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{15}}minutes.

@n The ride does a *full cycle* in @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{30}} minutes. _(A full cycle can either be measured from high-point to high-point or low-point to low-point.)_

@n Finish plotting the remaining points in the table (left) on the coordinate plane (right) to create a @vocab{scatter plot}.

@n Working from left to right, _connect the dots_ one pair at a time using straight lines. This will create a data visualization known as a *line-graph*.

@n Draw a dotted horizontal line on the graph, precisely halfway between the highest and lowest point. What is its altitude? @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{105}} feet.

@n Describe the relationship you see between `time` and `altitude`. (Is it linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.?) @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There's definitely a pattern here, but it doesn't look linear, quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic because it keeps going up and down!}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n What kind of ride do you think the teacher was on, and why? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a Ferris wheel, because that's the only kind of ride that goes up and down at regular intervals}} +
@fitb{}{}
