@n According to the table, the ride goes from @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{5}}{lowest point}feet to @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{205}}{highest point}feet in @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{15}}minutes

@n It then returns to the lowest point @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{15}}minutes later.

@n Once it gets going, the ride does a *full cycle* from *high-point to high-point* (or low-point to low-point!) in @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{30}} minutes.

@n The altitude *right between* the highest and lowest point is @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{105}} feet. _Draw this as a dashed line on your graph._

@n Plot each of the points in the table (left) on the coordinate plane (right) to create @vocab{scatter plot}.

@n Working from left to right, _connect the dots_ one pair at a time using straight lines. This will create a data visualization known as a *line-graph*.

@n Describe the relationship you see between `time` and `altitude`. (Is it linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.?) @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There's definitely a pattern here, but it doesn't look linear, quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic because it keeps going up and down!}} +

@n What kind of ride do you think your teacher was on, and why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a Ferris wheel, because that's the only kind of ride that goes up and down}} +
