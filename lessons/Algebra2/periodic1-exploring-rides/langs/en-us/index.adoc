= Exploring Carnival Ride Data

@description{
Students are introduced to periodic functions through a dataset with perfect sinusoidal behavior: _height on a revolving Ferris wheel_. They see the same behavior reflected in the (x,y) coordinates of a point on a unit circle, and plot the graphs of the sine and cosine functions. Finally, they make the leap from degrees to radians.

Students are introduced to the notion of @vocab{periodic relationships}: related variables where the @vocab{response variable} repeats the same pattern over and over as the @vocab{explanatory variable} increases.

@slidebreak{LaunchR}

@right{@image{images/state-fair.png, 200}}A physics teacher comes back from a trip to the state fair, and keeps raving about some amazing ride they took. The class keeps asking them for details: was it a Roller coaster? Bumper cars? Merry-Go-Round?

Being a teacher, of course they decide to turn the class's polite curiosity into a _learning experience_, and share some data they recorded from their smart watch. How can we figure out what ride they went on?

@QandA{
@Q{What are some of your Noticings, and what did they make you Wonder?}
@Q{What kind of ride do you think this teacher was on, and why?}
@A{Answers will vary. Write them all down on the board!}
@Q{What about this data supports your theory?}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

The teacher was probably on a _Ferris wheel!_ We can tell because the ride keeps going up and down over and over, and it repeats this cycle over regular periods of about 30 minutes.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

When you connected the dots on your scatter plot from left to right you created a *new type of data visualization*, called a @vocab{line graph}. Line graphs are useful in situations where *the explanatory variable is* @vocab{continuous}, meaning that you know there are values in between the points. 

@lesson-point{
It's not appropriate to connect the dots on _every_ scatter plot! 
}

How do we know whether or not our explanatory variable is continuous here?

While we might only have recorded Ferris wheel data every 5 minutes, we know that:

- The Ferris wheel keeps turning and generating data for an infinite number of points "in between" the times represented in our scatter plot. 
- The Ferris wheel existed at every one of those points, meaning there was `altitude` data to be gathered at all times.

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@ifslide{
@right{@image{images/rides-combined-plot.png}}
}

Connecting the dots with the line gives us an *approximation* of what data is missing between those times, and helps us see the shape of the relationship.

@lesson-point{Line graphs are often used instead of scatter plots when the explanatory variable is _time_.}

@QandA{
@Q{Why was it helpful to connect the dots to form a line graph?}
@A{It was difficult to see the pattern until we added the line!}

@Q{Do `time` and `altitude` appear to be related?}
@A{Guide the conversation toward the conclusion that YES there is a relationship.}

@Q{What kind of relationship is it? Is it Linear? Quadratic? Something else?}
@A{(Let students discuss)}

@Q{Why might we not want to use straight lines to connect these dots?}

== Unit Clocks

=== Overview
Students begin to reason about points on the circumference of a circle, with their x- and y-coordinates varying as a function of _rotation_.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{LaunchR}

@right{@image{images/ferris-wheel.png, 150}}The teacher's seat on the Ferris wheel can be thought of as a point on the circumference of a rotating circle.

- The y-coordinate (`altitude`) goes from 5ft to 205ft then back down to 5, then up again, then down again...
- This pattern of y-coordinates is _periodic_, repeating at regular intervals (over a period of 30 minutes)

@slidebreak{Launch}

None of the models we've seen so far will help us predict how far off the ground the seat is (y-coordinate) after a length of time (x-coordinate). Some of our models increase or decrease forever (linear, exponential, logarithmic), and quadratic models change directions _once_, but not over and over in a cycle!

@slidebreak{Launch}

Modeling cyclical relationships is _incredibly important_, for everyone from farmers to fishermen to healthcare providers! +
So many things in nature come in cycles:

- The sun rises and sets every day:  @math{\text{sun-height}(\text{time})} is periodic
- The tides come in and out each day:  @math{\text{tide}(\text{time})} is periodic
- People tend to get sick in the winter:  @math{\text{flu-cases}(\text{date})} is periodic

We're going to explore a new class of functions -- @vocab{periodic functions} -- that we can use to model cyclical relationships like these.

@lesson-instruction{
Can you think of other examples of periodic relationships?
}

@strategy{Why not "Trigonometric"?}{

@right{@image{images/non-sinusoidal-graphs.png, 175}}
"Periodic" is a broader term than _trigonometric_ (or _sinusoidal_). Science and engineering teachers will be quick to point out that periodic functions can be used to model both relationships that _cycle_ (smooth ups-and-downs) and those that oscillate (any kind of up-and-down!) +
{empty} +
We've chosen to use @vocab{periodic functions}, because the term applies in _all_ of these classes. As always, we advise you to use the term that works best for your classroom context!

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

To wrap our heads around periodic functions, let's think about something simpler than a Ferris wheel. Consider a simple clock that is centered around the origin, with a radius of 1.

@teacher{Note that the "unit clock" we are referring to here is not the same thing as the *unit circle* commonly referenced in math textbooks. We are consciously making the choice to use the clock instead because it is far more familiar and less abstract for students. We encourage you to resist the temptation to jump to discussing unit circles at this time. We will discuss similarities and differences of clocks and unit circles later in the lesson. 

Heads up: You may need to remind your brain that, unlike unit circles, clock hands move clockwise!}

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

- @right{@image{images/unit-circle-clock.png, 225}}The "hand" of the clock is just a radius, which hits the circumference at a point we'll call (A, B).
- As time passes, the hand spins around the circle, taking (A, B) with it.
	** At 12 o'clock, the radius lands at @math{(A = 0, B = 1)}.
	** At 3 o'clock, the radius lands at @math{(A = 1, B = 0)}.
	** At 6 o'clock, the radius lands at @math{(A = 0, B = -1)}.
- That radius also forms the @vocab{hypotenuse} of a right triangle with sides @math{x} and @math{y}, shown here in green and blue.
- As the point (A, B) moves around the circle, the values of @math{A} and @math{B} rise and fall between 1 and -1, over and over.

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@ifnotslide{@right{@image{images/pizza-slice2.png, 100}}}As the point (A, B) travels around the circumference of a circle, it reflects a changing angle @math{θ}. Think of a pizza slice, with @math{θ} as the angle at the tip of the slice, and the crust as the amount of the circumference the point has traveled.

@ifslide{@image{images/pizza-slice2.png, 50}}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
In our clock example, we divide the circle into twelve "slices", each representing one hour.

@Q{How many of those slices would represent 2 hours?}

@A{1/4 of a slice}

@Q{Of course, there are other ways besides 12 slices of "hours" to measure angles! Can you think of another measure that divides a circle up differently?}
@A{_Degrees_, divide a circle up into 360 slices instead of 12.
 * Each degree would represent... @math{\frac{1}{6}} of a minute.
 * 10 degrees would represent... @math{1} minute.
}
@A{_Minutes_, which divide our 12-hours into 720 slices. 
 * One-and-a-half of these slices would represent... 90 seconds.
 * 2 of these slices would represent... 120 seconds.
}
@A{_Compass Directions_ like North, South, East, and West, which divide our circle up into 4 slices instead of 12.
 * 2 of these slices would represent... the angle between North and South.
 * Half a slice would represent... the angle between West and Southwest.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

In our clock animation we have 12 "slices", with 12 evenly-spaced labels around the clock, but...

@lesson-point{We can divide a circle any way we want!}

@slidebreak{Investigate-DN}

@lesson-instruction{
- Return to the @starter-file{alg2-unit-clock}. On line 11 change `num-slices` to 360, and click "Run". 
  * Check to see whether this change the shape of the curves.
- Take a minute to play with `num-slices` and `num-labels`, making sure that `num-labels` divides evenly into `num-slices` with _no remainder!_
  * Can you divide the clock into 70 slices? 
  * Can you divide the clock into 92 slices? 
  * Check to see whether any of these divisions change the shape of the curves.
- Change the definition of `is-cw` so that the clock moves _counter_ clockwise, and click "Run".
  * Check to see whether this changes the shape of the curves.
}

@QandA{
@Q{Does changing the number of slices effect the way the curves are drawn? Why or why not?}
@A{Let students discuss.}
@A{The height of the curves depends only on the radius of the circle. Changing the number of circle-slices or names of the labels doesn't change the radius, nor will it change the curves. }

@Q{Did changing the direction from clockwise to counter clockwise change the shape of the curves? Why or why not?}
@A{The blue curve for the y-values should look the same.}
@A{The green curve for the x-values should start curving down instead of up when the direction is reversed.}

These curves are so important that Mathematicians use special names (@vocab{sine} and @vocab{cosine}) for the functions that describe them.

== From Hours to Radians

=== Overview
Students are introduced to @vocab{radians}, and practice converting between different units of angle measurement.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch}

Conveniently, we can chop up circles based on whatever kind of math we want to do, and the devices we have available to do our computations with.

- The Babylonians chose to use 360 slices to map out the "circle" representing the night sky, because 360 is roughly the number of days in a year and most easy-to-see constellations repeat their cycles annually.
  * 360 is a convenient number for mental math because it is easily divided by common numbers like 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12.
  * They also noticed that there were roughly 12 full moons each year. 

@slidebreak{LaunchR}

- @right{@image{images/egyptian-sundial.jpg, 150}}Many ancient peoples divided the night and day into 12 slices each (giving us 24 hours). 
  * The division of the sky into twelve slices influenced everything from astrological charts (12 zodiac signs), to time-keeping.
  * @link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial, Sundials} are used to map the journey of the shadow cast by the sun (in 12 slices) as it moves across the sky . The oldest-known sundial is from 1500 B.C.! 
  * The idea of time-keeping in groups of twelve became the 12 hours on the modern-day clocks we all use, and the motion of the clock hand around a circle is designed to mimic the rotation of the shadow on a sundial!
  * 12 is another convenient number for computations because people can use each of their thumbs to count 12 knuckles on its hand.

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

We often want to talk about the *distance* traveled around the circumference of a circle.

- For example, if we're building an arch out of bricks, we want to know how many bricks to use.
- We might also want to know _how far our teacher traveled_ on their trip around the Ferris wheel.

@slidebreak{Investigate}
Calculations involving circumference all involve the *radius* of the circle. So people wondered... 

==== Is there a way to divide the circle into slices so that radial calculations are easy? 
It would be nice to have a measurement of angle that's _expressed in terms of a radius_, to make the math cleaner...

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@right{@image{images/clock-6-equilateral.png, 100}@image{images/clock-6-hexagon.png, 100}}
Suppose the hand of our clock was made of rubber, and we could take it off and bend it around the circle. How many "clock hands" would it take to wrap all the way around the clock?

- We can start by imagining each slice as an equilateral triangle, where all three sides are exactly one radius.
- This would give us exactly six slices, with the tip of each slice having a 60° angle...

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
@Q{We could go all the way around the clock circle with 6 of those radius-triangles. Would 6 radii be enough distance to get around the circumference of the circle?}
@A{No -- they make a hexagon whose perimeter is *almost* as big as the circle, but not quite!}
}

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/clock-6-hexagon.png, 200}}}In order to bend the outer edge of the triangle into a curve that lands on the edge of the circle, while keeping the length of the curve equal to the radius, we'd have to make the angle _just slightly less than 60°_.

@lesson-point{Radian: the measure of the angle formed by carving out a radius's worth of the circumference}

If @math{θ} of each "radian" slice is _slightly less_ than 60°, we can fit _slightly more_ than 6 of these slices in our pie. +
In fact, *we can fit exactly* @math{2\pi} (@math{~6.28}) of these "radius slices" into a circle!

@lesson-point{@math{360° = 2\pi} radians}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

Pyret knows about @math{\pi}, too!

@lesson-instruction{

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
@Q{Where else have you seen @math{\pi} before?}
@A{In all of the geometric formulas for circles and other shapes with circular bases and/or cross sections.}

@Q{If there are @math{2\pi} radians in the whole circle, how many radians are in the _semi-circle_ between 3pm and 9pm on our clock?}
@A{@math{1\pi}}

@Q{How many radians are there in the _quarter-circle_ between 12pm and 3pm?}
@A{@math{\pi \over 2}}

@Q{How many radians are there in a single "hour" of the clock?}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

As with hours, degrees, and compass directions, switching our unit-clock graph from hours to radians wouldn't change the curve of our graph _at all_. It would only change the tick marks on the x-axis.

These are merely conventions that people have agreed upon over time to make it easy to collaborate. It's like driving on the right side of the road v. the left: it doesn't matter what we choose, as long as everyone makes the same choice!

@slidebreak{Investigate}

We could make a clock with the numbers written _backwards_ and have the hands move the other way! And as long as everyone uses the same clock, we can still tell time.

Regardless of the direction the "hands" turn, or whether we're dividing the circle into hours, minutes, radians, or anything else, the plotted curves will always be the same.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

We can use the special @vocab{sine} and @vocab{cosine} functions that describe the curves we saw earlier to calculate "A" and "B"!  

Most calculators abbreviate these functions as `sin` and `cos` and bury the distinction between whether or not they consume @vocab{radians} or @vocab{degrees} somewhere in the settings.

In Pyret, we make visible the reality that a function can only do one thing, so use different function names depending on what our functions consume. 

In Pyret, the contracts for the @vocab{radian}-consuming versions of these functions are: +
@hspace{4em}
@show{(contracts
'("sin" (Radians Number) "Number")
'("cos" (Radians Number) "Number")

And the contracts for the @vocab{degree}-consuming versions of these functions are: +

@strategy{Where did these Names Come From?}{

@right{@image{images/Etymology.png, 125}}
In ancient India, mathematicians thought that a vertical line drawn across the circle resembled the bowstring of a bow-and-arrow, which is also called a "cord". When cut in half, this "half-cord" represented the height of a right triangle formed by the angle! The Sanskrit word for "chord", _"jiva"_, was transliterated by Arabic mathematicians into _"jiba"_^1^. +
{empty} +
In the 12th century, Latin mathematicians mis-interpreted the Arabic _jiba_ as _jaib_, a completely different word meaning "pocket". When translated, the Latin word for "pocket" is _sinus_. The remaining part of the 180° or @math{\pi} in the semicircle formed by the bow is the "completion of the pocket", and the Latin prefix "co-" was used to name the length drawn by the remaining angle _cosinus_.

{empty}

[1] - Transliterating "v" and "b" sounds between languages is really common! Ask a Spanish-speaker how to pronounce the word "veinte" ("twenty")! They'll say "BEN-tay".
}

When graphed, each of these functions shows us the relationship between the angle and the height (sine), or the angle and the width (cosine).

@QandA{
@Q{If `sin` and `cos` consumed and produced _degrees_ instead of _radians_, would the shape of the curve change? Why or why not?}
