= Exploring Ferris Wheel Data

@description{
Students are introduced to periodic functions through a dataset with perfect sinusoidal behavior: _height on a revolving Ferris Wheel_. They see the same behavior reflected in the (x,y) coordinates of a point on a unit circle, and plot the graphs of the sine and cosine functions. Finally, they make the leap from degrees to radians.

== Looking for Patterns
@objective{model-explore}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the notion of @vocab{periodic relationships}: related variables where the response variable repeats the same pattern over and over as the explanatory variable increases.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/state-fair.png, 200}}A physics teacher comes back from a trip to the state fair, and keeps raving about some amazing ride they took. The class keeps asking them for details: was it a Roller coaster? Bumper cars? Merry-Go-Round?

Being a teacher, of course they decide to turn the class's polite curiosity into a _learning experience_, and share some data they recorded from their smart watch. How can we figure out what ride they went on?

@slidebreak

The teacher was probably on a _Ferris wheel!_ We can tell because the ride keeps going up and down over and over, and it takes the same amount of time to go up as it does to go down.

@slidebreak

You just created a *new type of data visualization*, called a @vocab{line graph}. They are useful in situations where the explanatory variable is @vocab{continuous}, meaning that you know there are values in between the points. 

@lesson-point{
It's not appropriate to connect the dots on _every_ scatter plot! 
}

How do we know whether or not our explanatory variable is continuous here?

While we might only have recorded Ferris wheel data every 5 minutes, we know that:

- The Ferris wheel keeps turning and generating data for an infinite number of points "in between" the times represented in our scatter plot. 
- The Ferris wheel existed at every one of those points, meaning there was `altitude` data to be gathered at all times.

@slidebreak

@ifslide{
@right{@image{images/rides-combined-plot.png}}

Connecting the dots with the line gives us an *approximation* of what data is missing between those times, and helps us see the shape of the relationship.

== Unit Clocks

=== Overview
Students begin to reason about points on the circumference of a circle, with their x- and y-coordinates varying as a function of _rotation_.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/ferris-wheel.png, 150}}The teacher's seat on the Ferris wheel can be thought of as a point on the circumference of a rotating circle.

- The y-coordinate (`altitude`) goes from 5ft to 205ft then back down to 5, then up again, then down again...
- This pattern of y-coordinates repeats at regular intervals (every 30m)

@slidebreak 

None of the models we've seen so far will help us predict how far off the ground (y-coordinate) the seat is after a length of time (x-coordinate). Some of them increase or decrease forever (linear, exponential, logarithmic), and others change directions _once_ (quadratic), but not over and over in a cycle!

@slidebreak

Modeling cyclical relationships is _incredibly important_, for everyone from farmers to fishermen to healthcare providers! +
So many things in nature come in cycles:

- The sun rises and sets every day:  @math{\text{sun-height}(\text{time})} is periodic
- The tides come in and out each day:  @math{\text{tide}(\text{time})} is periodic
- People tend to get sick in the winter:  @math{\text{flu-cases}(\text{date})} is periodic

We're going to explore a new class of functions - @vocab{periodic functions} - that we can use to model cyclical relationships like these.

@strategy{Why not "Trigonometric"?}{

@right{@image{images/non-sinusoidal-graphs.png, 175}}
"Periodic" is a broader term than _trigonometric_ (or _sinusoidal_). Science and engineering teachers will be quick to point out that periodic functions can be used to model both relationships that _cycle_ (smooth ups-and-downs) and those that oscillate (any kind of up-and-down!) +
{empty} +
We've chosen to use @vocab{periodic functions}, because the term applies in _all_ of these classes. As always, we advise you to use the term that works best for your classroom context!
}

=== Investigate

To wrap our heads around periodic functions, let's think about something simpler than a Ferris wheel. Consider a simple clock that is centered around the origin, with a radius of 1.

@teacher{Note that the "unit clock" we are referring to here is not the same thing as the *unit circle* commonly referenced in math textbooks. We are consciously making the choice to use the clock instead because it is far more familiar and less abstract for students. We encourage you to resist the temptation to jump to discussing unit circles at this time. We will discuss similarities and differences of clocks and unit circles later in the lesson. 

Heads up: You may need to remind your brain that, unlike unit circles, clock hands move clockwise!}

@right{@image{images/unit-circle-clock.png, 225}}

- The "hand" of the clock is just a radius, which hits the circumference at a point we'll call (A, B).
- As time passes, the hand spins around the circle, taking (A, B) with it.
	** When it's 12 o'clock, the radius lands at @math{(A = 0, B = 1)}.
	** At 3 o'clock, the radius lands at @math{(A = 1, B = 0)}.
	** At 6 o'clock, the radius lands at @math{(A = 0, B = -1)}.
- That radius also forms the @vocab{hypotenuse} of a right triangle with sides @math{x} and @math{y}, shown here in green and blue.
- As the point (A, B) moves around the circle, the values of @math{A} and @math{B} rise and fall between 1 and -1, over and over.

@right{@image{images/pizza-slice2.png, 100}}As the point (A, B) travels around the circumference of a circle, it reflects a changing angle @math{θ}. Think of a pizza slice, with @math{θ} as the angle at the tip of the slice, and the crust as the amount of the circumference the point has traveled.

== From Hours to Radians

=== Overview
Students are introduced to @vocab{radians}, and practice converting between different units of angle measurement.

=== Launch

Conveniently, we can chop up circles based on whatever kind of math we want to do, and the devices we have available to do our computations with.

- The Babylonians chose to use 360 slices to map out the "circle" representing the night sky, because 360 is roughly the number of days in a year and most easy-to-see constellations repeat their cycles annually. 360 is also easily divided by common numbers like 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12, which makes calculating with those numbers a lot easier.

@slidebreak

- Babylonians also noticed that there were roughly 12 full moons each year and that 12 is a convenient number for calculations done people who only have their hands to count with, because a hand has 12 finger joints that can be touched with the thumb. They divided the night and day into 12 slices each (giving us 24 hours). Thousands of years later, the 12 slices of a circular @link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial, sundials} Babylonians used to tell time became the 12 hours on a clock. 

@slidebreak

We often want to talk about the *distance* traveled around the circumference of a circle.

- For example, if we're building an arch out of bricks, we want to know how many bricks to use.
- We might also want to know _how far our teacher traveled_ on their trip around the Ferris wheel.

Calculations involving circumference all involve the *radius* of the circle. Is there a way to divide the circle into slices so that radial calculations are easy? It would be nice to have a measurement of angle that's _expressed in terms of a radius_, to make the math cleaner...

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/clock-6-equilateral.png, 100}@image{images/clock-6-hexagon.png, 100}}
Suppose the hand of our clock was made of rubber, and we could take it off and bend it around the circle. How many "clock hands" would it take to wrap all the way around the clock?

- We can start by imagining each slice as an equilateral triangle, where all three sides are exactly one radius.
- This would give us exactly six slices, with the tip of each slice having a 60° angle...
@QandA{
@Q{We could go all the way around the clock circle with 6 of those triangles. Would 6 radii be enough distance to get around the circumference of our circle?}
@A{No - they make a hexagon whose perimeter is almost as big as the circle, but not quite!}
}
--

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/clock-6-hexagon.png, 200}}}In order to bend the outer edge of the triangle into a curve that lands on the edge of the circle, while keeping the length of the curve equal to the radius, we'd have to make the angle _just slightly less than 60°_.

@lesson-point{Radian: the measure of the angle formed by carving out a radius's worth of the circumference}

If @math{θ} of each "radian" slice is less than 60°, we can fit just slightly more than 6 of these slices in our pie. In fact, we can fit *exactly @math{2pi}* of these "radius slices"!

@lesson-point{@math{360° = 2\pi} radians}

@A{@math{1\pi}}
@Q{How many radians are there in the _quarter-circle_ between 12pm and 3pm?}
@A{@math{\pi \over 2}}
@Q{How many radians are there in a single "hour" of the clock?}
@A{@math{\pi \over 6}}

=== Investigate

Pyret knows about @math{\pi}, too!

@lesson-instruction{
- In the Interactions Area, try evaluating `PI` (all caps!). What do you get back?
- Try computing the value of @math{3\pi}.
- Try computing the value of @math{\pi / 2}.

@slidebreak

As with hours, degrees, and compass directions, switching our unit-clock graph from hours to radians doesn't change the curve of our graph _at all_. It only changes the tick marks on the x-axis.

*Note:* The conventions for labeling a clock are different from the conventions for labeling circles with Radians or Degrees.

These are conventions that people have agreed upon over time to make it easy to collaborate. It's like driving on the right side of the road v. the left: it doesn't matter what we choose, as long as everyone makes the same choice!

We could make a clock with the numbers written _backwards_ and have the hands move the other way! And as long as everyone uses the same clock, we can still tell time._

To plot these relationships when the input is @vocab{radians}, instead of hours, we'll use the @math{sine} and @math{cosine} functions. In Pyret (and most calculators) these function names are abbreviated as `sin` and `cos`.
