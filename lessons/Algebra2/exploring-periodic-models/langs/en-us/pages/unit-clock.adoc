The questions on this page deal with a _unit clock_ (shown below, on the right). A point (x, y) sits on the circumference of the clock. A radius of length 1, extending from the center to (x, y), forms an angle @math{θ} with the x-axis. As time passes, the point (x, y) rotates around the circle.

@n What are the coordinates of the *center* of the clock? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{(0, 0)}}

@n How long is the *hypotenuse* of the right-triangle formed by x, y, and @math{r}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n At which two "times" does @math{A = B} @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1:30, 7:30}}

@n At which two "times" does @math{A = -B} @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4:30, 10:30}}

@n @math{x^2 + y^2 = } @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{1}} for every possible value of @math{x} and @math{y} on the circumference.

@n Identify the x and y-coordinates for 3, 6 and 9 o'clock and add them to the table below.

@n At 1:30, the right triangle formed by x, y, and @math{r} has an angle of @fitb{3em}{@ifsoln{45°}}. Find the lengths of x and y. @math{x =} @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{@math{\sqrt{2}\over 2} or 0.7071}} and @math{y =} @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{\sqrt{2}\over 2} or 0.7071}} 

@n Use your answers from the question above to help you complete the remaining rows of the table above.

@n What is the relationship between @math{\mbox{Time}} and @math{x}? Draw a dot to mark the value of *@math{x}* at each of the times from the table above, then connect the dots with a *solid* line to graph the function _x(time)_.

@n What is the relationship between @math{\mbox{Time}} and @math{y}? Draw a dot to mark the value of *@math{y}* at each of the times from the table above, then connect the dots with a *dashed* line to graph the function _y(time)_.

@n "Turn on" the `x(time)` folder, and compare the graph to your graph of `x(time)`. Do they match?

@n Turn off that first folder, and turn on the one for `y(time)`. Compare the graph to your own. Do they match?
