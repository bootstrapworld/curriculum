@n What do you Notice about the data in the table? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Time keeps going up, but altitude goes up and down, over and over. Altitude goes from}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{5 feet to 205 feet, then back down and up again. It takes 30m for the altitude to return to the high or low point}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{} +

@n The ride goes from @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{5}}feet (lowest) to @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{205}}feet (highest) in @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{15}}minutes, then takes @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{15}}minutes to go back down.

@n Once it gets going, the ride does a *full cycle* from high-point to high-point (or low-point to low-point!) in @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{30}} minutes.

@n Create a `line-graph` in Pyret. Add what you learn from it to the scatter plot you drew above.
_Hint: Use your @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, contracts pages}!_

@n Do you see a relationship between `time` and `altitude`? Why or why not? If you do, what *kind* of relationship is it (linear, exponential, etc.)? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes - there's definitely a pattern here, but it doesn't look linear, quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic!}} +

@n What kind of ride do you think your teacher was on, and why? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a Ferris wheel, because that's the only kind of ride that goes up and down}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{at regular intervals}} +
