* Import Desmos Styles

* This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
* which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
*
* It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
* to style all demos glphys
*
* Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
* {points}
* {caret}
* {magnifying}
* {wrench}

* Here's an example of using these:

For this page, you'll need to load @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos} open on your computer.

Periodic models with @math{sin} have the form @math{f(x) = a \sin(b(x - d)) + c}. You will find this function on your screen in Desmos, along with four sliders for @math{a}, @math{b}, @math{c}, and @math{d}.

== Amplitude

@n The graph of the @math{f} goes up and down, going as high as @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{10}} and as low as @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{-10}}. On the left, the slider for @math{a} is set to @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{10}}.

@n *Try adjusting the slider for @math{a}*. How does that affect the graph of the function? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Higher values of @math{a} make the waves reach higher and lower extremes. Lower values make the peaks and valleys shorter}}

@n What do you *Wonder*? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Why is the second column of both tables the same? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{we defined @math{y_2} to be the same as @math{y_1}}}

@n How is the first column of this new table different from the original? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are using the function @math{g(x)} to take the log of `pc-gdp`}}

@vspace{1ex}

**Turn the points for the first table OFF, then turn the points for our new table ON.** Our log transformation is so drastic that it looks like all the black datapoints are smashed against the y-axis!

@n *Rescale* the graph ([.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}#) to see the cloud. What is the shape of this point cloud? Is it linear? Quadratic? Exponential? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's linear!}}

@n Move the sliders for @math{m} and @math{b} to create the best-fitting linear model you can find, and write it below.

[cols="^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
@math{f(x) = }@fitbruby{10em}{}{slope (m)}@math{x + }@fitbruby{10em}{}{y-intercept / vertical shift (b)}
|===

@n Why do you think transforming the *x-values* make our data look linear? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The amount of extra income needed}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{to create an extra year of predicted lifespan increased exponentially. By taking the log of that income,}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{we are "cancelling out" that exponential growth and making it linear.}}

== Transforming Axes vs. Transforming Data

@n From your linear model above, copy your values for slope (@math{m}) and vertical shift (@math{c}):

[cols="^1a,^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{~12 to ~16}}{slope (m)}
| @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{~8 to ~25}}{vertical shift (c)}
|===

@n Look back at the values you wrote for log coefficient (@math{a}) and vertical shift (@math{c}) on question 8 of @printable-exercise{exploring-logarithmic-models/pages/changing-scale.adoc} and copy them here:

[cols="^1a,^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{~12 to ~16}}{log coefficient (a)}
| @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{~8 to ~25}}{vertical shift (c)}
|===

@n Are they similar? @fitb{5em}{} Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They are similar because we changed the _kind_ of growth from logarithmic to linear, but not the _amount_. }} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Instead increasing logarithmically by @math{B}, our new function increases _linearly_ by @math{B}}} +
@fitb{}{}
