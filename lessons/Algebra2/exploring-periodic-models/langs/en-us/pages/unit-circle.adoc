The questions on this page deal with a _unit circle_ (shown below, on the right). A point (A, B) sits on the edge of the circle. A radius extending from the center to (A, B) forms an angle @math{θ} with the x-axis. As @math{θ} increases, the point (A, B) rotates around the circle.

@n What is the radius of the unit circle? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n What are the coordinates of the *center* of the circle? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{(0, 0)}}

@n How long is the hypotenuse of the right-triangle formed by (A, B)? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1}}

@vspace{1ex}

*Write the hours (1-12) on the outside of the circle, as if it were a clock*

@n At what "hours" is A the largest? @fitb{5em}{3 and 9} @hspace{1em} What about B? @fitb{}{12 and 6}

@n @math{A^2 + B^2 = } @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{1}} for every possible value of A and B on the circumference.

@n At "12 o'clock",  (A, B) is at the coordinates (0, 1). At this "time", the length of A is 0 and the length of B is 1. Fill in the table below to show the coordinates of (A, B) at *3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock*.

@n When @math{A = B}, what is @math{θ}? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{45° or @math{\pi/2}}} How long are @math{A} and @math{B}? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{@math{1\over\sqrt{2}} or 0.7071}} At which two "hours" does this occur? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{1:30, 7:30}}

@n When @math{A = -B}, what is @math{θ}? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{45° or @math{\pi/2}}} How long are @math{A} and @math{B}? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{@math{1\over\sqrt{2}} or 0.7071}} At which two "hours" does this occur? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4:30, 10:30}}


@n Fill in the empty rows of the table below for each of these times.

@n The graph below has _length_ on the y-axis (from -1 to 1), and _hours_ on the x-axis. Draw a dot to mark the *Length of A* at each of the times from the table above, then connect the dots with a *solid* line.

@n Draw a dot to mark the *Length of B* at each of the times from the table above, then connect the dots with a *dashed* line.
