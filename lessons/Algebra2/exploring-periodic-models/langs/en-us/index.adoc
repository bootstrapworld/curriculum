== Looking for Patterns

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the notion of @vocab{periodic relationships}: related variables where the response variable repeats the same pattern over and over as the explanatory variable increases.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/state-fair.png, 200}}Your physics teacher comes back from a trip to the state fair, and keeps raving about some amazing ride they took. The class keeps asking them for details: was it a Roller coaster? Bumper cars? Merry-Go-Round?

Being a teacher, of course they decide to turn your casual curiosity into a _learning experience_, and share some data they recorded from their smart watch.

[.rideData, cols="^1a,^1a", options="header"]
|===
| `time` (minutes)  | `altitude` (feet)
|  0				|   5.0
|  5				|  55.0

In this example, we know the Ferris wheel keeps turning, generating data "in between" the times represented in our scatter plot. Connecting those dots with the line gives us an approximation of what data is missing between those times, and helps us see the shape of the relationship.

@A{A Ferris wheel, because the ride keeps going up and down over and over, and it takes the same amount of time to go up as it does to go down.}
@Q{But what kind of relationship is it? Is it Linear? Quadratic? Something else?}
@A{(Let students discuss)}
}

== Periodic Functions

=== Overview
Students are introduced to periodic functions, and they become familiar with the terminology to describe them.

=== Launch

@right{@image{images/ferris-wheel.png, 150}}Your teacher's seat on the Ferris Wheel can be thought of as a point on the circumference of a rotating circle. 

- The y-value (`altitude`) goes from 5ft to 205ft then back down to 5, then up again, then down again...
- This pattern of y-values repeats at regular intervals (every 30m)

If we can compute the y-coordinate of that point, we'll know the altitude of the seat! +
But how can we compute the y-coordinate, based on the rotation of the circle?

@slidebreak

Let's consider the models we've studied:

- linear, exponential and logarithmic models either keep increasing forever or keep decreasing forever. 
- quadratic relationships grow one way until they reach a maxima or minima _once_, before growing in the other direction.

*None of the tools in our modeling toolkit work for functions that keep repeating, going up and down over time!*  

@slidebreak

This is a problem, because modeling cyclical relationships is _incredibly important_, for everyone from farmers to fishermen to healthcare providers! So many things in nature come in cycles:

- the sun rises each morning and sets each night (for most of the world)
- the moon waxes and wanes
- the tides come in and out
- certain plants always seem to bloom in the Spring
- people tend to get sick in the winter

In this lesson we'll explore a new class of functions - _@vocab{periodic functions}_ - that we can use to model cyclical relationships like these.

@strategy{A note on Vocabulary}{

You've probably heard of related terms _sinusoidal functions_ or _trigonometric functions_. We've chosen @vocab{periodic functions} because the term shows up often in both K-12 math _and_ science and engineering classes, in an attempt to balance the two. Note that "periodic" is also a broader term, as there are periodic functions that are _not_ sinusoidal/trigonometric. Science teachers may be quick to point out that periodic functions can be used to model relationships that _cycle_ (smooth ups-and-downs) and those that oscillate (any kind of up-and-down!).

@center{@image{images/non-sinusoidal-graphs.png}}

As always, we advise you to use the term that works best for your classroom context!
}

@slidebreak

==== Unit Clocks

@right{@image{images/unit-circle-clock.png}}Let's think about a simpler case, of a clock with a radius 1 that is centered around the origin. +
 +
We can draw a radius at any "time", on the clock hitting the circumference at some point (x, y).

_For example, when it's 12 o'clock, the radius lands at @math{(0,1)}._

That radius also forms the @vocab{hypotenuse} of a right triangle with sides @math{x} and @math{y}, shown here in green and red.

@lesson-instruction{
- With a partner, complete questions 1-6 of @printable-exercise{unit-clock.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/unit-circle-clock.png}}}

@QandA{
@Q{At what time does the radius lands on the point (0,-1)?}
@A{6pm?}
@Q{At what time(s) does the radius land on the x-axis?}
@A{3pm lands on (1,0)}
@A{9pm lands on (-1,0)}
@Q{At which time(s) does x = y?}
@A{1:30 and 7:30}
@Q{If we knew that @math{x} and @math{y} were equal, how could we calculate them from this right triangle?}
@A{We could use the Pythagorean Theorem: @hspace{1em} @math{x^2 + x^2 = 1^2}}
}

@teacher{
Make sure you have created a link or code for your class to @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos} and paced the class so they only have access to Slide 1: Unit Clocks. Students will be using this slide to check their work on @printable-exercise{unit-clock.adoc}

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/pizza-slice2.png, 100}}As the point (x,y) travels around the circumference of a circle, it reflects a changing angle @math{θ}. It can be helpful to think of this as a pizza slice, with @math{θ} as the angle at the tip of the slice, and the crust as the amount of the circumference (x,y) has traveled. 

@QandA{
In our clock example, we divide the circle into twelve "slices", each representing one hour. But of course, there are other ways besides 12 slices of "hours" to measure this angle!
@Q{Can you think of another measure that divides a circle up differently?}
@A{
- _Minutes_, which divide our circle up into 720 slices instead of 12.
- _Degrees_, divide a circle up into 360 slices instead of 12.
- _Compass Directions_ like N, NE, E, SE, etc., which divide our circle up into 8 slices instead of 12.
}
@Q{On our graph, would the shape of the curve change if we labeled the x-axis with 360 degrees instead of 12 hours?}
@A{No -- all the intervals remain constant, so the only change is the *labels* on the x-axis.}
}

@slidebreak

==== Radians

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/pizza-slice2.png, 200}}}Degrees aren't always the best way to divide up a circle.  We often want to use the *radius* of the circle in our calculations, just as we used the radius of the Ferris wheel to talk about altitude. In these cases, it would be nice to have a measurement of circumference that's _expressed in terms of radius_, to make the math cleaner...

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/pizza-6-equilateral.png, 200}}What if we wanted a pizza slice where the length of the crust is exactly the same as the length of the radius? How many slices would there be in the pie? 

- We can start by imagining each slice as an equilateral triangle, where all three sides are exactly one radius. 
- This would give us exactly six slices, with the tip of each slice having a 60° angle...
@QandA{
@Q{If each of our six slices were an equilateral triangle, our pizza wouldn't be round anymore.}
@Q{What shape would we get instead?}
@A{A hexagon!}
}

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/pizza-6.png, 200}}}In order to bend the outer edge of the triangle into a curve that lands on the edge of the circle, while keeping the length of the curve equal to the radius, we'd have to make the angle _just slightly less than 60°_. 

@lesson-point{Radian: the measure of the angle formed by carving out a radius's worth of the circumference}

If @math{θ} of each "radian" slice is less than 60°, we can fit just slightly more than 6 of these slices in our pie. In fact, we can fit *exactly @math{2pi}* of these "radius slices"!

@lesson-point{@math{360° = 2pi}}


@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{If there are @math{2pi} radians in the whole circle, how many radians are in the _semi-circle_ between 3pm and 9pm on our clock?}
@A{@math{1\pi}}
@Q{How many radians are there in the _quarter-circle_ between 12pm and 3pm?}
@A{@math{\pi \over 2}}
@Q{How many radians are there in a single "hour" of the clock?}
@A{@math{\pi \over 6}}
}

@slidebreak

Pyret knows about @math{\pi}, too!

@lesson-instruction{
- Open @starter-file{editor}
- In the Interactions Area, try evaluating `PI` (all caps!). What do you get back?
- Try computing the value of @math{3\pi}.
- Try computing the value of @math{\pi / 2}.
- Why do we need spaces around the multiplication and division signs?
}

@teacher{Be prepared to remind students to read the error messages when they type `3PI` instead of `3 * PI`  and `PI/2` instead of `PI / 2`}

@slidebreak

As with degrees, switching our unit-clock graph from hours to radians doesn't change the curve of our graph at all. It just changes the tick marks on the x-axis.

*Note:* The conventions for labeling a clock are different from the conventions for labelling circles with Radians or Degrees.

|===


_These are conventions that people have agreed upon over time to make it easy to collaborate. If somebody wanted to make a clock with the numbers written backwards and have the hands move the other way, it would be possible to learn how to tell time using their clock... but it likely would be more confusing than helpful for most people if we hung a clock like that in our school._

@lesson-instruction{
Complete the table on @printable-exercise{converting-angles.adoc} with your partner, following the prompts in #1 and #2.
}

@slidebreak

We began by graphing the relationship between the legs of a right triangle and the angle formed based on the time on a clock using the functions @math{A(time)} and @math{B(time)}.

To plot these relationships when the input is @vocab{radians}, instead of hours, we'll use the @math{sine} and @math{cosine} functions. In Pyret (and most calculators) these function names are abbreviated as `sin` and `cos`.

@lesson-instruction{
- One of these functions computes the "x values" from our unit circle, corresponding to @math{A} on the unit clock. The other computes the y-values, corresponding to @math{B}.
- Figure out which one is which by completing @printable-exercise{converting-angles.adoc} with your partner.
- You will be using the radian values from your table with the `sin` and `cos` functions in Pyret. 
- The contracts for these functions are: +
@center{
@show{(contracts
'("sin" ("Number") "Number")
'("cos" ("Number") "Number")
)}
}
}

=== Investigate
Periodic models have the basic form:

@center{@math{f(x) = A \sin(B(x - h)) + k} @hspace{1em} **OR** @hspace{1em} @math{g(x) = A \cos(B(x - h)) + k}}

Both @math{sin} and @math{cos} are closely related to one another, and each one can be expressed in terms of the other. We're going to investigate @math{sin} for now, but everything you learn will also apply to @math{cos}.

@QandA{
@Q{Many of the models we've studied had a coefficient added at the end of the definition. Thinking back to what you learned, what effect do you think @math{k} has on a periodic model?}
@A{It's the vertical shift - it moves the midline of the graph up and down the y-axis.}
@Q{What effect do you think each of the _other_ coefficients has on the model?}
@A{Some may recognize @math{h} as the horizontal shift, or @math{a} as some kind of multiplier that makes the peaks higher and the troughs lower}
}

@slidebreak

@teacher{Sync or pace students to __Slide 2: Graphing Periodic Models__ of @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos}.}

@lesson-instruction{

}

@slidebreak

@teacher{As you debrief, give ample time for students to hear each other's thinking. Concepts like amplitude and frequency can be difficult to describe, and having students reach a consensus on their definition in their own words will help deepen their understanding.}

@centered-image{images/wave-labeled-terms.png, 450}

@slidebreak

*Peaks, Troughs and Midline*

When graphed from 0-@math{2\pi}, periodic functions rise to a certain height above a @vocab{Midline}, then drop the same distance below it, then rise and fall again to complete the cycle. This cycle then repeats over and over.

- @vocab{Peaks} - the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests}) 
  * _Since periodic functions rise and fall repeatedly, there isn't a maxima, but math books sometimes refer to each peak as a local maxima_
- @vocab{Troughs} - the lowest points on the wave 
  * _Since periodic functions rise and fall repeatedly, there isn't a minima, but math books sometimes refer to each trough as a local minima_
- @vocab{Midline} - a horizontal line that falls halfway between the peaks and the troughs

@slidebreak

==== Amplitude @math{A}

The distance from a peak or trough to the @vocab{midline}.  

@slidebreak

==== Period @math{=} @math{2\pi \over \mbox{frequency}}

The period is the horizontal distance over which the curve travels before it begins to repeat itself (one complete wave). 
- It can be measured from peak to peak or from trough to trough.
- The @vocab{frequency} (@math{B}) is _how many cycles_ occur over a @math{2\pi} interval.
[.rideData, cols="^4a,^1a, ^1a", options="header", stripes="none"]
|===
|																			| Period 		| Frequency 	
| When @math{B = 1}															|@math{2\pi} 	| 1	
| When the @vocab{period} is cut in half, the @vocab{frequency} _doubles_	|@math{\pi} 	| 2
| When the @vocab{period} doubles, the @vocab{frequency} is _cut in half_	|@math{4\pi}	| @math{1/2}	
|===

@slidebreak

==== Horizontal Shift (@math{h})

The @vocab{Horizontal Shift} is also called the @vocab{Phase Shift}.

- When @math{h} < 0, it shifts the graph to the left.
- When @math{h} > 0, it shifts the graph to the right. 

_Note: In the function definition @math{f(x) = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k}, when h is positive it looks like it's being subtracted._

==== Vertical shift (@math{k})

The vertical shift is the amount the function is shifted up or down
- When @math{k} < 0, the graph is shifted down.
- When @math{k} > 0, the graph is shifted up. 


@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{

@teacher{
*NOTE:* The altitude column of the Ferris wheel dataset has been rounded to make it easier for students to use. This rounding will result in _some_ error in the model.
}

Suppose you needed to compute the model for a _different_ Ferris Wheel. Would you know how to use the radius and speed of the wheel to compute the model?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{make-a-wheel.adoc} with your partner.
}

=== Synthesize
Periodic relationships involve repeating cycles. Like our Ferris wheel, they rise and fall along regular intervals. Can you come up with some examples of periodic relationships?

@teacher{
This can be a terrific out-of-seats activity:

- Have groups of students go to whiteboards/flipcharts, and write down their periodic relationship (e.g. - phases of the moon, tides, etc).
- Ask them what the period is, then the x-axis, then the y-axis. For example, phases of the moon has a period of roughly 1 month, so the x-axis might be days. For the y-axis, we could use "Percent of visible moon" or "number of lumens".
- Under that description, have them draw axes and their wave!
}

For each one:

- Can you estimate the _period_ of the relationship?
- Can you estimate the _amplitude?_
- Can you estimate the _midline_ and _vertical shift?_

@teacher{
You'll likely need to support students in thinking through what these terms mean in the context of their first example, to get the class started. Suppose a student volunteers "the temperature, because it gets cold in the winter and warm in the summer":

- The seasons change over the course of one year, so the period would be 365 days.
- The temperature in your area might fluctuate between 95° in the summer and 25° F in the winter. That's a range of 70° F, for an amplitude of 35° F.
- The @vocab{midline} and the vertical shift are at 60° F (25 + 35 = 60).
}

== Modeling Periodic Relationships

=== Overview
Students explore the @COtwo dataset, which tracks the recorded quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from an observatory in Hawaii.

=== Launch
Of course, the Ferris wheel dataset has almost no variability! The wheel doesn't change size or speed, and there aren't any other variables influencing the data. As a result, our scatter plot lines up perfectly with a periodic model.

Now that we've had some practice, let's take a look at a dataset that has more variability!

@slidebreak

Carbon Dioxide (@math{CO_2}) is the gas inside the bubbles in a can of soda. It's what we breathe out when we exhale. In solid form, it's known as dry ice. It's also known as a "greenhouse gas", because it traps heat. When enough of it is in the atmosphere, it can make the planet warmer and warmer.

@slidebreak

Scientists are concerned about how much @COtwo is in the atmosphere, so they take frequent measurements from multiple locations around the globe. The amount of @COtwo in the atmosphere is measured in _parts-per-million_, abbreviated "ppm". Of course, there are many things that can influence the amount of @COtwo in any one location!

- Temperature and air pressure
- Proximity to @COtwo -producing or @COtwo -consuming sources
- Global trends like the burning of fossil fuels

Because of these and other factors, the amount of @COtwo at any one location goes up and down throughout the year. But is there a pattern?

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-co2}, save a copy, and click "Run".
- What is the name of the table here?
- What are the names of the columns?
- Type `co2-table` into the Interactions Area, and look at the table.
- What do the `year`, `month`, and `co2` columns mean?
- What do you think the `date` column could mean?
}

@slidebreak

The `date` column is the *decimal year*, in which the __n__th day of the year is divided by 365:

@QandA{
The first date is `1974.375`, meaning the sample was taken `.375` of the way through 1974.
@Q{How could we compute which day of the year that is?}
@A{There are 365 days in the year, so we could multiply 365 by `.375` to see the number of days into the calendar.}
@Q{What is @math{365 \times 0.375}?}
@A{136.875, or roughly day 137}
@Q{What month does that fall in, and what "month-number" is that?}
@A{May, the 5th month}
@Q{What is written in the `month` column for the first row?}
@A{5, which is May}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- What do you *Notice* about this dataset?
- What do you *Wonder*?
}

Look farther down in the Definitions Area, until you find the function `is-recent`.

@QandA{
@Q{What does it do?}
@A{It takes in a row, and checks to see if the decimal date is between 2022.083 and 2023.7917.}
@Q{What is defined on the following line of code?}
@A{A table, which contains only the rows for which the filter function produces `true`: just the rows between those dates.}
}

@slidebreak

The `recent-table` includes just the rows from trough-to-trough for the years 2022-2023.

@QandA{
@Q{How many periods are represented here?}
@A{One}
@Q{Why?}
@A{Because the distance between any adjacent troughs or peaks define one period.}

@strategy{Optional Activity: Guess the Model!}{

1. Divide students into teams of 2-4, and have each team come up with a periodic, real-world scenario, then have them write down a periodic function that fits this scenario on a sticky note. Make sure no one else can see the function!
2. On the board or some flip-chart paper, have each team draw a _scatter plot_ for which their periodic function is best fit. They should only draw the point cloud - _not the function itself!_ Finally, students title display to describe their real-world scenario (e.g. - "Water depth at a beach vs. Time of Day").
3. Have teams switch places or rotate, so that each team is in front of another team's scatter plot. Have them figure out the original function, write their best guess on a sticky note, and stick it next to the plot.
4. Have teams return to their original scatter plot, and look at the model their colleagues guessed. How close were they? What strategies did the class use to figure out the model?

- The coefficients can be constrained to make the activity easier or harder. For example, limiting these coefficients to whole numbers, positive numbers, etc.
- To extend the activity, have the teams continue rotating so that each group adds their sticky note for the best-guess model. Then do a gallery walk so that students can reflect: were the models all pretty close? All over the place? Were the guesses for one coefficient grouped more tightly than the guesses for another?
}

=== Synthesize

- Could you rewrite this model to use cosine instead of sine?
- If so, how?
- What are some problems you see with this model?
- Where does it fit the data best? Where does it fit the worst?


== Hybrid Models

=== Overview
Students discover that their periodic model for `recent-table` data doesn't fit the historical data very well. They explore the historical data, discovering that there's a stronger pattern at work than the seasonal periodicity: a linear pattern of rising @COtwo over time. They try fitting a linear model first, then combine it with their periodic model to find a better fit.

=== Launch
The resulting model fits the `recent-table` data pretty well, with an S-value of about 1.2ppm. But how well does it fit, if we try it with data from more than just the one year?

The starter file includes another table, called `modern-table`, which is all the data from 2010 and beyond.

@lesson-instruction{
- Fit your model with the `modern-table`.
- What @math{S} value do you get?
- What do you think is going on?
}

@slidebreak

We can still see our model running along the top of the graph, but the data doesn't line up with the model _at all_ until about the end of 2022.

What do you think will happen if we try to fit this model to _all_ of our data? Try it out!

@slidebreak

It gets even worse!

=== Investigate
Let's just look at the historical data by itself, without worrying about models.

@lesson-instruction{
- In small groups, discuss what you Notice and Wonder about this plot.
- Be prepared to share back with the class!

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/historical-scatter-plot.png}}}It looks like there are two different things going on here:

1. The amount of @COtwo in the air _generally_ rises linearly over time, for a positive, linear relationship with the year.
2. But at the same time, there are seasonal, periodic variations that cause it to fluctuate up and down across that line.

@lesson-instruction{
- Do you think it's possible for a model to be both linear _and_ periodic?
- In small groups, see if you can come up with an idea for a function that combined the best of both models.
}

@teacher{Have students share their models and/or discuss their thinking.}

@slidebreak{InvestigateR-DN}

@lesson-instruction{
@ifslide{@right{@image{images/historical-scatter-plot.png}}}
- Complete as much of @printable-exercise{modeling-historical-co2.adoc} as you can.
}

@slidebreak

Our periodic model had two terms:

- The periodic term @math{4.13 \times sin(2\pi(x - 2023.1))}, which described the wave that wrapped around the horizontal midline
- The vertical shift @math{419.87}, which described the (fixed) y-coordinate of the midline

But when we zoomed out to see the historical @COtwo data, we saw that the midline isn't horizontal at all!

@slidebreak

*The midline _is_ our linear model!*

By replacing the vertical shift term in our periodic model with the linear model, we get the best of both worlds! Linear behavior for the midline over the years, and periodic behavior for the seasonal variation in @COtwo.

We can visualize the body of the function using the Circles of Evaluation:

[.hybridCOE]
@show{(coe '(+ (* 4.13 (sin (* (* 2 PI) (- x 2023.1)))) (+ (* 1.8345 x) -3296) ))}

@lesson-instruction{
- If you haven't already defined your hybrid model, define it in the Definitions Area and finish @printable-exercise{modeling-historical-co2.adoc}.
- How much better is the @math{S} value of the hybrid model, compared to the purely-linear one?
}

=== Synthesize

- Why did our hybrid model fit better than the periodic or linear models alone?
- Look closely at where the hybrid model fits the data. When does the data _under_ or _over_ predict? What could this mean?
- What would a model look like for a disease like Covid, but with seasonal variations that cause minor peaks and troughs?

@strategy{Going Deeper}{
Have your students refer back to @lesson-link{exploring-exponential-models}. As with the `recent-table` table in @starter-file{alg2-co2}, the starter file there constrains the dataset to show only recent data. This is done for the same reason: to introduce students to a more perfectly-exponential model. Now that students know how to combine terms from different models, they can go back and build a model that fits the entire Covid dataset!
