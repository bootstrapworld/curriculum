== Looking for Patterns @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the notion of @vocab{periodic relationships}: related variables where the response variable repeats the same pattern over and over as the explanatory variable increases.

@right{@image{images/state-fair.png, 200}} Your physics teacher comes back from a trip to the state fair, and keeps raving about some amazing ride they took. The class keeps asking them for details: was it a Rollercoaster? Bumper cars? Merry-Go-Round? Being a teacher, of course they decide to turn your casual curiosity into a _learning experience_, and share some data they recorded from their smart watch:

This worksheet had you create a *new type of data display*, called a @vocab{line graph}.

@slidebreak

In this example, we know the ferris wheel keeps turning, generating data "in between" the times represented in our scatter plot. Connecting those dots with the line gives us an approximation of what data is missing between those times, and helps us see the shape of the relationship.

== Periodic Functions

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/ferris-wheel.png, 300}}The relationship we're looking at is an example of a @vocab{periodic relationship}.

- The y-value (`height`) goes from 5ft to 205ft then back down to 5, then up again, then down again...
- This pattern of y-values repeats at regular intervals (every 30m)

*None of the tools in our modeling toolkit work here!* We've studied relationships that keep increasing or decreasing. We've studied relationships that grow one way until they a maxima or minima, before growing in the other direction.

But we don't have any functions that keep repeating, going up and down over time.

@slidebreak

That's a problem for us as data scientists, because so many things in nature comes in _cycles:_ for most of the world, the sun rises each morning and sets each night, the moon waxes and wanes, and the tides come in and out. You may even have noticed that certain plants always seem to bloom in the Spring, or that more people tend to get sick in the winter. Being able to model these phenomenon is incredibly important, for everyone from farmers to fishermen to healthcare providers!

In this lesson we'll explore these periodic relationships, and a new class of functions - _@vocab{periodic functions}_ - that we can use to model cyclical relationships like these.

@strategy{A note on Vocabulary}{

You've probably heard of related terms _sinusoidal functions_ or _trigonometric functions_. We've chosen @vocab{periodic functions} because the term shows up often in both K-12 math _and_ science and engineering classes, in an attempt to balance the two. Note that "periodic" is also a broader term, as there are periodic functions that are _not_ sinusoidal/trigonometric. Science teachers may be quick to point out that periodic functions can be used to model relationships that _cycle_ (smooth ups-and-downs) and those that oscillate (any kind of up-and-down!).

As always, we advise you to use the term that works best for your classroom context!
}

=== Investigate

When graphed, periodic functions rise to a certain height above a @vocab{Midline}, then drop the same distance below it, then rise again to complete the cycle. This cycle then repeats over and over.

@center{@image{images/wave-labeled-terms.png, 75%}}

- @vocab{Peaks} - the highest points on the wave (also called @vocab{Crests})
- @vocab{Troughs} - the lowest points on the wave
- @vocab{Period} - the length of a complete cycle, from peak-to-peak or trough-to-trough
- @vocab{Midline} - a horizontal line that falls halfway between the peaks and the troughs
- @vocab{Amplitude} - the distance from a peak or trough to the midline

@slidebreak

@ifslide{
@center{@image{images/wave-labeled-terms.png, 650}}
}

Starting at @math{x=0} with some initial value, a periodic function will rise to a maximum value (@vocab{peak}) or fall to a minimum value (@vocab{trough}), before returning to its initial value. As @math{x} increases, it will repeat this pattern over and over, fluctuating between its @vocab{peaks} and @vocab{troughs} over regular intervals, called @vocab{periods}.

You may already be familiar with two of the best-known periodic functions, @math{sin} and @math{cos}. Here are their contracts:

@center{
@show{(contracts
'("sin" ("Number") "Number")
'("cos" ("Number") "Number")
)}
}

*Note*: There are other periodic functions that do _not_ look like waves! For this exploration, we're going to limit ourselves to @math{sin} and @math{cos}.

@slidebreak

Periodic models with @math{sin} have the form @math{f(x) = a \sin(b(x - d)) + c}

@QandA{
@Q{You've seen the coefficient @math{c} before. What affect do you think it has on the model?}
@A{It's the vertical shift - it moves the midline of the graph up and down the y-axis.}
@Q{What effect do you think each of the _other_ coefficients has on the model?}
@A{Some may recognize @math{d} as the horizontal shift, or @math{a} as some kind of multiplier that makes the peaks higher and the troughs lower}
}

Both @math{sin} and @math{cos} are closely related to one another, and each one can be expressed in terms of the other. We're going to investigate @math{sin} for now, but everything you learn will also apply to @math{cos}.

@teacher{Review student answers to the worksheet, giving ample time for them to hear one another's answers. Concepts like amplitude and frequency can be difficult to describe, and having students reach a consensus on their definition in their own words will help deepen their understanding.}

@slidebreak

The period is the distance between one @vocab{trough} and the next in a cycle. The frequency is _how many cycles_ occur over an interval.

@lesson-point{The @vocab{frequency} is the _inverse_ of the @vocab{period}}

- If the @vocab{period} is @math{2pi}, then the frequency is @math{1}.
- If the @vocab{period} doubles to @math{4pi}, the @vocab{frequency} _halves_ to  @math{pi/2}
- If the @vocab{period} is cut in half, the @vocab{frequence} _doubles_ to @math{2}

@slidebreak

Let's review our coefficients:

- @vocab{Amplitude} (@math{a}): the distance from a peak or trough to the midline
- @vocab{Frequency} (@math{b}): the number of cycles in a given interval
- @vocab{Vertical Shift} (@math{c}: the amount the graph is shifted up (@math{c} > 0) or down (@math{c} < 0)
- @vocab{Horizontal Shift} (@math{d}): the amount the graph is shifted right (@math{c} > 0) or left (@math{c} < 0)

== Looking for Patterns	@duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview

Students explore the @math{CO_2} dataset, which tracks the recorded quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from an observatory in Hawaii.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-co2}.
- Make a scatter-plot showing the Covid infection rate for Massachusetts.
- What kind of model do you think would fit this best?
}

@strategy{Why just New England, starting from June 9th?!?}{

We have _artificially constrained this dataset_, showing only the data from June 9th to December 26th, 2020. We've made this choice in order to showcase the most purely-exponential behavior of the infection curve, for the sake of this lessons' math learning goals.

For students who are farther along, we recommend showing them _all_ the data through 2020, starting in January rather than June. The first portion of the infection curve shows a gradual, linear growth pattern before exploding in the Fall of 2020. This is _polynomial_ behavior, where a linear term dominates when the exponential term is small.

Based on the strength of your students, we encourage you to choose the data that best fits your learning goals. You may also wish to return to full dataset later on, once students are comfortable with polynomial functions.

To use all available data, open the @starter-file{alg2-covid} and change the source sheet on line 7 from `"New England"` to `"All"`
