= Fitting Hybrid Models

@description{Students investigate periodic relationships, first by deciphering the patterns in a dataset with perfect periodic (sinusoidal) behavior and then by looking at data about Carbon Dioxide, using an inquiry-based model involving hypothesizing, experimental and computational modeling, and sense-making. }

@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. +
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-exploring-periodic-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first three slides. _(As the lesson progresses you will be directed to adjust the pacing or sync students to you so that they have access to relevant slides.)_
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

== Hybrid Models

=== Overview
Students discover that their periodic model for `recent-table` data doesn't fit the historical data very well. They explore the historical data, discovering that there's a stronger pattern at work than the seasonal periodicity: a linear pattern of rising @math{\text{CO}_2} over time. They try fitting a linear model first, then combine it with their periodic model to find a better fit.

=== Launch
The resulting model fits the `recent-table` data pretty well, with an S-value of about 1.2ppm. But how well does it fit, if we try it with data from more than just the one year?

The starter file includes another table, called `modern-table`, which is all the data from 2010 and beyond.

@lesson-instruction{
- Fit your model with the `modern-table`.
- What @math{S} value do you get?
- What do you think is going on?
}

@slidebreak

@center{@image{images/modern-bad-fit.png}}

We can still see our model running along the top of the graph, but the data doesn't line up with the model _at all_ until about the end of 2022.

What do you think will happen if we try to fit this model to _all_ of our data? Try it out!

@slidebreak

It gets even worse!

@QandA{
@Q{If our model is so bad at fitting historical data, why was it so good at fitting just the one year?}
@A{Models are only reliable within the span of the data they fit. The fact that the model fit `recent-table` well means it's a good model _for that year_, but we can't make any assumptions about dates outside of the range of the training data.}
}

=== Investigate
Let's just look at the historical data by itself, without worrying about models.

@lesson-instruction{
- In small groups, discuss what you Notice and Wonder about this plot.
- Be prepared to share back with the class!

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete questions 1 and 2 on @printable-exercise{modeling-historical-co2.adoc}

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/historical-scatter-plot.png}}}It looks like there are two different things going on here:

1. The amount of @math{\text{CO}_2} in the air _generally_ rises linearly over time, for a positive, linear relationship with the year.
2. But at the same time, there are seasonal, periodic variations that cause it to fluctuate up and down across that line.

@lesson-instruction{
- Do you think it's possible for a model to be both linear _and_ periodic?
- In small groups, see if you can come up with an idea for a function that combined the best of both models.
}

@teacher{Have students share their models and/or discuss their thinking.}

@lesson-instruction{
@ifslide{@right{@image{images/historical-scatter-plot.png}}}
- Complete as much of @printable-exercise{modeling-historical-co2.adoc} as you can.
}

@slidebreak

Our periodic model had two terms:

- The periodic term @math{4.13 \times sin(2\pi(x - 2023.1))}, which described the wave that wrapped around the horizontal midline
- The vertical shift @math{419.87}, which described the (fixed) y-coordinate of the midline

But when we zoomed out to see the historical @math{\text{CO}_2} data, we saw that the midline isn't horizontal at all!

@slidebreak

*The midline _is_ our linear model!*

By replacing the vertical shift term in our periodic model with the linear model, we get the best of both worlds! Linear behavior for the midline over the years, and periodic behavior for the seasonal variation in @math{\text{CO}_2}.

We can visualize the body of the function using the Circles of Evaluation:

[.hybridCOE]
@show{(coe '(+ (* 4.13 (sin (* (* 2 PI) (- x 2023.1)))) (+ (* 1.8345 x) -3296) ))}

@lesson-instruction{
- If you haven't already defined your hybrid model, define it in the Definitions Area and finish @printable-exercise{modeling-historical-co2.adoc}.
- How much better is the @math{S} value of the hybrid model, compared to the purely-linear one?
}

=== Synthesize

- Why did our hybrid model fit better than the periodic or linear models alone?
- Look closely at where the hybrid model fits the data. When does the data _under_ or _over_ predict? What could this mean?
- What would a model look like for a disease like Covid, but with seasonal variations that cause minor peaks and troughs?

@strategy{Going Deeper}{
Have your students refer back to @lesson-link{exponential1-exploring-covid}. As with the `recent-table` table in @starter-file{alg2-co2}, the starter file there constrains the dataset to show only recent data. This is done for the same reason: to introduce students to a more perfectly-exponential model. Now that students know how to combine terms from different models, they can go back and build a model that fits the entire Covid dataset!
