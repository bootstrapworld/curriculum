== Deconstructing a Model

@n The four functions below are defined in the @starter-file{alg2-hybrid}. Use `fit-model` to fit `periodic-cos` and `periodic-cos2` to the `recent-table` data. 


@indented{
```
fun periodic-cos(x): (4.13 * cos(6.28 * (x - 2023.35))) + 419.87 end 
fun wave-cos(x):     (4.13 * cos(6.28 * (x - 2023.35)))          end 
fun midline-cos(x):                                       419.87 end 
fun periodic-cos2(x):     wave-cos(x)      +      midline-cos(x) end
```

}

@n Looking at the definitions of these 4 functions, explain what is going in `periodic-cos2` and why it produces the same graph as `periodic-cos`. @fitb{}{}

== What kind of model?

@n Identify which kind of model above would best describe... {nbsp} our `wave-cos` function: @fitb{13em}{@ifsoln{periodic}} {nbsp} our `midline-cos` function: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{linear}}

@n @image{../images/modern-co2-scatter.png, 125} Of the models you described above, which do you think it would make the most sense to try fitting to this scatter plot? Why? @fitb{}{}
