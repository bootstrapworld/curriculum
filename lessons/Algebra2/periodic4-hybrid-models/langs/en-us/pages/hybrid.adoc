== Deconstructing a Model

In the Definitions Area, you'll see the following four functions:

@indented{
```
fun periodic-cos(x):  (4.13 * cos(6.28 * (x - 2023.35))) + 419.87 end
fun wave-cos(x):      (4.13 * cos(6.28 * (x - 2023.35)))          end
fun midline-cos(x):                                        419.87 end 
fun periodic-cos2(x):         wave-cos(x)     +    midline-cos(x) end
```
}

@n Use `fit-model` to fit `periodic-cos` to the `recent-table` data.

- What is the equation of this model's @vocab{midline}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{something like {nbsp} @math{f(x) = 419.87}}}
- Describe the shape of this line @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a straight, horizontal line}}
- Where does the @vocab{midline} show up in our `periodic-cos` function? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The last term, which describes the vertical shift}}

@n Are `periodic-cos` and `periodic-cos2` the same model? Why or why not? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{I see that: }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`hybrid` adds `midline-cos` to `wave-cos`.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`mid-line` is just the horizontal shift of the `periodic-cos` function.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`wave-cos` is just all of the parts of the `periodic-cos` function except for the horizontal shift.}}

@n Check your answer by fitting `periodic-cos2` to the `recent-table` data!

@center{*This code deconstructs `periodic-cos` into two helper functions: one for the `wave`, and one for the `midline` it wraps around.*} 

@n Following this example, deconstruct your `periodic-sin` model and define `periodic-sin2` in the starter file.

== Composing a `hybrid` model for the `modern-table`

These functions are built to wrap around a midline with the equation @math{f(x) = 419.87}. But who says the midline has to be _horizontal?_

@n Which midline should a model for the `modern-table` use instead? _(HINT: it's already defined in your starter file!)_ @fitb{}{@ifsoln{{nbsp}@math{f(x) = 2.141263x - 4461}}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line of best fit from our `lr-plot`, which we've defined in our starter file as `linear-modern`}}

@n *Change the definition of `hybrid-model` so it looks like `periodic-sin2`! Keeping the `wave-sin` part the same, *change the midline function* from `midline-sin` to the new midline you described above.

@n Fit `hybrid-modern` to the `modern-table`, and describe what you see: @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n What @vocab{S-value} did you get with this data? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~1.4}}

@n What @vocab{S-value} did `linear-modern` get with this data? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.27}}

@n How much
@fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{less}}{more / less }
error do we expect in predictions made using `hybrid-modern` than with the `linear-modern` model?
