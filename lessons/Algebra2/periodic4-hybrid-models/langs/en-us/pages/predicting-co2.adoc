@n Looking at the scatter plot, how would you describe the shape of the data in the `modern-table`? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Answers will vary! Listen to students' language._}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_- diagonal & positive slope_}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_- wave / curve / squiggle_}}

@n How does it compare to the shape of the data we worked with in the `recent-table`? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{That data didn't look diagonal at all.}}

@n In Pyret, fit your `periodic` model to the `modern-table`. Then sketch it on the scatter plot above.

@n How would you describe the shape of your periodic model? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{_Answers will vary. Perhaps: a wave the goes up and down between two horizontal lines_}}

@n Describe what changes you could make to your model so that it would fit the data better.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. We could change the y-intercept.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It needs to be rotated so that the wave undulates around}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a diagonal line rather than a horizontal line.}}

@n What @vocab{S-value} did you get when you fit your model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary slightly.  ~17.8 }}

@n Why doesn't it make sense to compare the @vocab{S-value} we got for the `periodic` model from the `recent-table` to the @vocab{S-value} we got from the `modern-table`? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because the @vocab{S-value} has to be considered within the range of the data and the ranges are very different! }}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`modern-table` data ranges from 387.03ppm to 424ppm.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{`recent-table` data ranges from 415.74 to 424.}}
