== How well does our model predict @math{CO_2} levels for other years?

You built your model using the `recent-table`, which covers the most recent full year of our dataset.

@n Let's see how well if fits the broader dataset. In Pyret, fit your model to the `modern-table`.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. We could change the y-intercept.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It needs to be rotated so that the wave undulates around}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a diagonal line rather than a horizontal line.}}

@n What @vocab{S-value} did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary slightly.  ~17.8 }}

@n Why doesn't it make sense to compare the @vocab{S-value} we got for the `periodic` model from the `recent-table` to the @vocab{S-value} we got from the `modern-table`? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because the @vocab{S-value} has to be considered within the range of the data and the ranges are very different!}}
