You built your `periodic` model using the `recent-table`, which covers the most recent full year of our dataset. Let's see how well if fits the broader dataset.

@n How would you describe the shape of your periodic model? @fitb{}{}

@n How would you describe the shape of this scatter plot of the data in the `modern-table`? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n In Pyret, fit your `periodic` model to the `modern-table`.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. We could change the y-intercept.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It needs to be rotated so that the wave undulates around}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{a diagonal line rather than a horizontal line.}}

@n What @vocab{S-value} did you get when you fit your model? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary slightly.  ~17.8 }}

@n Why doesn't it make sense to compare the @vocab{S-value} we got for the `periodic` model from the `recent-table` to the @vocab{S-value} we got from the `modern-table`? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because the @vocab{S-value} has to be considered within the range of the data and the ranges are very different! This dataset ranges from 387.03ppm to 424ppm.}}
