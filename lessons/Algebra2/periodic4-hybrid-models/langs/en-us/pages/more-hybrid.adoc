== Building a hybrid model for the entire `co2-table`

@n How well would you expect our `hybrid-modern` model to fit the data in the full `co2-table` with data covering a span of 50 years?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Better than our periodic model did, but once we're out of the data range it was built on it will probably need some adjusting.}}

@n Let's test it out. What @vocab{S-value} do you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~12.241}}

@n Find the section of the starter file that says "HYBRID MODEL for the full co2-table". Define `hybrid-all` as a model that fits all of the data well. Be sure to think through which functions you will need to define in order to be able to compose your function definition.
@teacher{the line of best fit for the full `co2-table` data is @math{y = 1.83453x - 3296.8}}

@n Use `fit-model` to fit your new `hybrid-all` model to the `co2-table`. What is the @vocab{S-value} of `hybrid-all` with this data? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.937}}

@n How much @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{less}}{more / less }
error do we expect in predictions made using `hybrid-all` than with the `hybrid-modern` model for our `co2-table` data?

== Comparing __S__-values doesn't always make sense
@vspace{1ex}

You've had a lot of practice comparing the @vocab{S-values} of two different models on the same dataset (including what you just did on this page!), to quantify the error between them. *But can we compare the @vocab{S-values} for one model fit to _two different datasets?_*

@vspace{1ex}

In the table below, we've taken the original periodic model you created from `recent-table`, and fit it to all three tables:

@vspace{1ex}

@indented{
[cols="2a,^1a,^1a,^1a", options="header"]
|===
|
| `recent-table`
| `modern-table`
| `co2-table`

| @vocab{S-value} of model from `recent-table`
| ~1.2ppm
| ~17.76ppm
| ~55.89ppm

| lowest y-value (@math{CO_2} in ppm)
| 415.74ppm
| 387.03ppm
| 327.28ppm

| highest y-value (@math{CO_2} in ppm)
| 424ppm
| 424ppm
| 424ppm
|===
}

We built the `periodic-sin` model from `recent-table`, _so of course_ it was a good fit for that data! But looking at the first row of this table, we can see that it fits worse for larger datasets.

@n It's tempting to compare the @math{\text{S-values}} in this table, to quantify how much more error we'd expect from the `periodic-sin` model for the `co2-table`. *We shouldn't we?*

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{\text{S-values}} only mean something when we consider them within the context of the range of the data. We can compare @math{\text{S-values} for different models}}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{models when they're applied to the same dataset, but, in this case, we're looking at datasets with very different ranges!}}

@teacher{Data Scientists have many tools in their toolboxes and @vocab{S-values} are just one of them. If your students are already familiar with @math{r^2}, now would be a good time to point out that when it doesn't make sense to compare @vocab{S-values} we can fall back on some of our other tools.}

@star Just as there's nothing to say that midlines have to be horizontal, there’s also nothing to say that midlines need to be straight! If you look closely, the `co2-table`’s midline almost looks quadratic… can you come up with a `hybrid-curve` model for the `co2-table` that can beat the @vocab{S-value} you just found?
