| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
This lesson focuses on _linear relationships_, and the math content of the lesson is primarily a review of those concepts from Algebra 1 (the third section includes topics that may be new to some students). That being said, the bulk of the new learning serves two objectives:

- This lesson establishes a structure for exploring relationships in data: (1) build a model from samples, (2) fit a model, and (3) better modeling. Students will repeat this process in subsequent explorations.
- The lesson also includes some programming content, allowing students to learn necessary programming skills while practicing the math they already know.

== Looking for Patterns @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
@teacher{Students explore the State Demographics dataset and, building on a discussion of the displays they previously made using the animals dataset, recognize the unique opportunity scatter plots offer for exploring relationships between columns.}

=== Launch
We're going to search for relationships within a dataset about all the states in the US. But first, let's take a moment to (1) develop confidence in our ability to use functions for working with tables and making displays, and (2) build familiarity with a new dataset that we are going to spend a lot of time with.

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-states}.
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{exploring-states.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What did you Notice and Wonder?}
@Q{What did you learn about defining rows in Pyret?}
@A{Example: `x = row-n(states-table, 0)` will make the name `x` have the value of the first row in the table (the index starts at zero!).}
@Q{How would define a name `y` to be the value of the _second_ row in the table? The third?}
@A{`y = row-n(states-table, 1)` for the second row. Change the `1` to a `2` for the third.}
}

In math, @math{x = 4} will define a variable @math{x} to be the value @math{4}. Any time we use @math{x} after that, we can substitute in the value of @math{4}. This works in Pyret, too. But in Pyret, values can be more than just numbers! In this file, the variables `alabama` and `alaska` are defined as rows from the table.

@teacher{Debrief the rest of the page with students. Then, initiate a conversation about the various column names, ensuring that students understand all of the terminology. Later in the lesson, students will examine relationships between income and education. We recommend posing the questions below to ensure that they are ready to do so.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What columns in this dataset have to do with wealth?}
@A{`pct-in-poverty`, `poverty-rate`, `median-income`, `per-capita-income`}
@Q{What columns are about education levels?}
@A{`college-or-higher`, `hs-or-higher`}
}

=== Investigate

Before we dig deeper into @starter-file{alg2-states}, let's think back to the animals at the shelter in order to introduce some new data science concepts.

@QandA{
@Q{Think back to the dataset we explored about animals at the shelter.}
@Q{Would you imagine that younger animals get adopted faster than older animals? Why or why not?}
@A{The goal here is to have an open discussion and draw students in. Allow students to share their opinions freely. (For example: Yes, baby animals get adopted quickly because they're so cute! No, animals require too much work when they are young.)}
@Q{What kind of data does the `age` variable represent? What about `weeks`?}
@A{Both `age` and `weeks` are quantitative variables.}
@Q{What kind of display would help us analyze the relationship between age and adoption time?}
@A{Again, solicit student's ideas and discuss why each display type would or would not work.}
}

@slidebreak

Pie and bar charts help us see the _frequency_ of values in a single _categorical_ column. There are other displays, like histograms and box plots, that help us explore the _distribution_ of values in a single _quantitative_ column.

But what we really want is a display that will help us search for _a relationship between two quantitative columns_, and that's exactly what scatter plots do!

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{
@vocab{Scatter plots} reveal the relationship between two columns by plotting one on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.
}

Before we can draw a scatter plot, we have to make an important decision: which variable do we think of as the _cause_ - called the @vocab{explanatory} variable - and which is the _effect_ (@vocab{response variable})?

In this case, which do we suspect is the cause and which is the effect: age or time-to-adoption?

@slidebreak

We suspect that age affects the adoption time, so we'll use `age` as our @vocab{explanatory variable} and `weeks` as our @vocab{response variable}.

@strategy{Why not Independent/Dependent?}{

Data Science relies on concepts in Probability. When discussing events in Probability, we may say two events are _dependent_ or they are _independent_. For instance, we might say having a job and having a college education are dependent because one affects the probability of the other occurring. When discussing relationships in Data Science, we want to go further than just saying two things are connected: We want to consider if they are *causally connected*: one of them affects the other, but not vice versa. Therefore, we think of one variable as being explanatory and the other as the response variable. For instance, having a college education would be our explanatory variable, and having a job would be the response.
}

It's customary to use the horizontal axis for our explanatory variable and the vertical axis for the response variable. Each row in the dataset will be represented by a point on the scatter plot with `age` for @math{x} and `weeks` for @math{y}.

@slidebreak

We are going to be focusing some of our thinking on our state and its neighbors. Which states should we focus on?

@teacher{Come to a consensus about which states your students will explore. When more students are looking into the same data, you'll find much richer class discussions!}

@lesson-instruction{
- It's time to return to the @starter-file{alg2-states}!
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete Part 1 of @printable-exercise{looking-for-patterns.adoc}.
- Do not go on to Part 2! We'll return to that later in the lesson.
}

@teacher{Encourage students to first _think about which columns might be related_, and then create the scatter plot to search for this relationship, rather than making scatter plots for random pairs of columns. The dataset is designed so that students will quickly begin searching for relationships between varying levels of education and income, and there are linear relationships in each of these.}

@strategy{Exploring the States Dataset}{

The @starter-file{alg2-states} has a lot of interesting data, and endless possible combinations of columns to explore. But randomly smashing columns together in a scatter plot is not the habit we want students to cultivate! Instead, make sure students are actually talking with their partners about why two columns may or may not be related. 

Making sense: can students predict these relationships, and explain their thinking? (If so, probably not worth having them spend time on more than one of them!)

- `pop-2010` vs. `pop-2020`.
- `pop-2020` vs. `num-households`
- `num-housing-units` vs. `num-households`
- `num-households` vs. `num-veterans`

Surprises in the District of Columbia: DC often shows up as an outlier or extreme value. But why? Here are a few relationships to spark students' interest.

- `pct-college-or-higher` vs. `pct-in-poverty`
- `median-income` vs. `pct-college-or-higher`
- `median-income` vs. `pct-home-owners`
- `pct-college-or-higher` vs. `pct-home-owners`
- `pct-college-or-higher` vs. `pct-home-owners`
- `pct-home-owners`, `num-housing-units`
- `median-income` vs. `per-capita-income`

}


=== Synthesize

- Share your scatter plots with one another (copying and pasting `scatter-plot` displays into a shared document, for example, and then labeling those displays). 
- What possible relationships did you find?
- Did you and your classmates commonly use any words to describe the relationships you observed?

@teacher{_Note: Students will acquire the formal vocabulary that data scientists use to assess relationships in the next section of this lesson, which is all about identifying form, direction, and strength._}

== Describing Patterns @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
Students identify and make use of @vocab{correlations} in scatter plots. They learn to characterize their @vocab{form} as being linear, curved, or showing no clear pattern. They learn that linear patterns have @vocab{direction}, and they learn how to report @vocab{strength} (as well as direction) with a number called the "correlation."

=== Launch

Scatter plots let us visualize the relationship between two quantitative columns. If no relationship exists, the points in the scatter plot just appear as a shapeless cloud. But if there _is_ a relationship, the points will form some kind of pattern. When we build scatter plots, we are searching for patterns between two quantitative variables.

These patterns can be described by three terms: *form*, *direction*, and *strength*.

@slidebreak

|===
| @image{images/1b1.gif, 250}
| @image{images/2NL.gif, 250}
| @image{images/B.gif, 250}

| Some patterns are *linear*, and cluster around a straight line sloping up or down.
| Some patterns are *nonlinear*, and may look like some kind of curve.
| And sometimes there is *no relationship* or pattern at all!
|===

@lesson-point{
@vocab{Form} indicates whether a relationship is linear, nonlinear or undefined.
}

@teacher{
@opt{Have students turn to @opt-printable-exercise{linear-nonlinear-bust.adoc} and decide whether each of the scatter plots could be modeled by a linear relationship, a nonlinear relationship, or that there doesn't appear to be a pattern.}
}

@slidebreak

If the relationship clusters around a straight line, we can talk about _direction._

@right{@image{images/C.gif, 200 }}*Positive*: The line slopes up as we look from left-to-right. Positive relationships are by far the most common because of natural tendencies for variables to increase in tandem. For example, “the older the animal, the more it tends to weigh”.

@clear

@right{@image{images/A.gif, 200}}*Negative*: The line slopes _down_ as we look from left-to-right. For example, “the older a child gets, the fewer new words he or she learns each day.”

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{
Only @vocab{linear} relationships have @vocab{direction}.
}

Not every shape has a direction! For example, a curve can start out sloping upwards, but then peak and slope downwards.

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{
@vocab{Strength} indicates how closely the two variables are related.
}

@right{@image{images/A.gif, 200}}*A relationship is strong if knowing the x-value of a data point gives us a very good idea of what its y-value will be* (knowing a student's age gives us a very good idea of what grade they're in). A strong linear relationship means that the points in the scatter plot are all clustered _tightly_ around an invisible line.

@clear

@right{@image{images/1a.gif, 200}}*A relationship is weak if x tells us little about y* (a student's age doesn't tell us much about their number of siblings). A weak linear relationship means that the cloud of points is scattered very _loosely_ around the line.

=== Investigate

Now that you've dug into the role that form, direction and strength play in assessing a relationship between two quantitative variables, it's time to put those concepts to work!

@lesson-instruction{
- We need to train our eyes to look for form so that we know whether we're justified in fitting a line to the scatter plot and reporting a correlation, neither of which would be appropriate if the form is non-linear.
- Let's start by practicing matching the scatter plots to their descriptions on @opt-printable-exercise{identifying-form-matching.adoc}.
}

@teacher{Review student answers, and have students _explain their thinking_ for this activity. For students who are struggling, hearing what their peers are looking for is especially helpful at this stage.}

@slidebreak


@lesson-instruction{
In pairs or small groups, complete @opt-printable-exercise{identifying-form.adoc}
}

@teacher{Review student answers. Some of the answers are not so clear-cut, and students may disagree about what constitutes a "strong" vs. "weak" correlation. We've tried to choose scatter plots that clearly fall into one category or the other, but without diving into the algorithm for linear regression students may find this exercise somewhat subjective... and that's ok!}

@lesson-instruction{
Return to @printable-exercise{looking-for-patterns.adoc}, and complete Part 2.
}


=== Common Misconceptions
- Students often conflate strength and direction, thinking that a strong correlation _must_ be positive and a weak one _must_ be negative.
- Students may also falsely believe that there is ALWAYS a correlation between any two variables in their dataset.
- Students often believe that strength and sample size are interchangeable, leading to mistaken assumptions like "any correlation found in a million data points _must_ be strong!" Or "there are only a few data points, so the relationship _must_ be weak!" (Sample size only plays a role if we’re trying to generalize to what’s true for a larger population.)

=== Synthesize

- What relationships did you explore in the states dataset?
- Which appeared to have strong correlations? Were they positive or negative?
- Were any of these relationships a surprise? Why or why not?

== Building Linear Models @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview

Building on prior knowledge of linear functions, students learn to find the line of best fit to model the relationship in a scatter plot that looks linear. This yields a predictor function that tells what y-value to expect for a given x-value. Students also learn how to quantify how closely a model fits a dataset, using @vocab{residuals} and @vocab{S} as a measure of how well their models fit the data.

=== Launch

Before we learn to fit linear models to scatter plots, let's review. *What do you remember about linear functions?*

@teacher{
We'd expect students to be able to surface much of the following:

- Linear functions look like straight lines.
- Vertical lines are not functions, because their slope is undefined as a result of their horizontal change being zero.
- The steepness of a line can be described by its @vocab{slope} (or _constant_ @vocab{rate of change}).
- The @vocab{slope} can be calculated from any two points.
- Students may remember the @vocab{slope} as @math{\frac{change \; in \; y}{change \; in \; x}} or @math{\frac{rise}{run}} or @math{\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}. 
- The point where the line crosses the y-axis is called the @vocab{y-intercept}.
- The x-coordinate of the @vocab{y-intercept} always starts with zero, e.g. @math{(0, y)}.
- Diagonal lines have both a @vocab{y-intercept} and an @vocab{x-intercept}.
- Horizontal lines have a constant rate of change of zero.
}

@right{@image{images/difference-table-linear.png, 200}} Linear relationships grow by fixed amounts, meaning that the difference between two y-values will always be the same over identical horizontal intervals. In the table shown to the right, you can see arrows pointing out the "jumps" between y-values for intervals of 1. Each jump is the same size.
*If the rate of change is constant, the relationship is linear.*

@QandA{
@Q{Try comparing intervals of 2, instead of intervals of 1. Is the difference between y-values from @math{x=1} to @math{x=3} the same as the difference between y-values from @math{x=2} to @math{x=4}?}
@A{Yes.}
}


@comment{
@QandA{
@Q{What is the y-value when x=0?}
@A{By following the pattern of the blue arrows backwards, we can subtract 2 and arrive at y=3}
@Q{What is the slope of the line?}
@A{2, because the arrows show that y increases by 2}

Knowing the y-intercept and the "size of the growth", we can tell that the equation of this line is @math{f(x) = 2x + 3}.
}
}

@opt{Students are about to be asked to write the Slope-Intercept form of the line, given two points in our states dataset. If your students haven't done much work with calculating slope and y-intercept from pairs of points recently, we recommend prepping them for success by having them complete @opt-printable-exercise{def-2-points.adoc}.}

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
Return to Pyret and the @starter-file{alg2-states}.
Make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `pct-college-or-higher` and `median-income`, using `state` for the labels.
}

@slidebreak

@center{@image{images/college-v-income.png}}

This scatter plot appears to show a positive, linear relationship: states with higher percentages of college graduates tend to have higher median household incomes.

@slidebreak
@ifslide{@right{@image{images/college-v-income.png}}}
@lesson-instruction{
Suppose the United States were to add a new state. _Based on the data for the existing 50 states (plus DC!)..._

- What median household income would you predict, if exactly 30% of the new state's citizens had attended college?
- What would you predict if 20% had attended college? 
- If 40% had attended college?
}

@teacher{
@right{@image{images/pyret-window.png, 150}} Let students discuss, and explain their thinking. If possible, mark off a single point for each of the hypothetical percentages, then connect those points to show a straight line. Note that some of these new points would require changing the x-min, x-max, y-min and/or y-max of our display, which we can do by typing in the cells on the right side of the scatterplot and clicking "Redraw".
}

@slidebreak

When we see patterns in data, we can use those patterns to _make predictions_ based on that data. We can even draw a line to show all the possible predictions at once! These predictions represent our "best guess" at the underlying relationship in the data, as we try to model that relationship using math.

These models are just functions being graphed on top of the scatter plot, with the goal of minimizing the squared distances between the line and all the points on the plot. For relationships that look linear, the "predictor function" is a linear model of the form @math{f(x) = mx + b}. For historical reasons, this @vocab{line of best fit} is sometimes called the @vocab{regression line}.

@slidebreak

When we make a model, we want it to be the closest possible approximation of all the points. If we used another line instead of the "line of best fit," it wouldn't be as close to all the points as a group, and wouldn't do as good a job at predicting y-values from x-values.

Let's find the best fit we can make for this dataset!

@lesson-instruction{
Complete @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income-1.adoc}.

@teacher{
@opt{If your students could use more support for finding the equation of the line between two points, direct them to the scaffolded version of @opt-printable-exercise{model-college-v-income-1-scaffolded.adoc} instead.}
}


=== Synthesize

- Why wasn't the Alaska-Alabama model a good fit for the rest of the data?
- If we had chosen two other points from which to build our model, could we have done better? Which points would you choose, and why?

== Fitting Linear Models @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
Armed with their linear models, students confront the notion of "model fitness". How do we measure how well a model fits? How do we determine which of two models is best?

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- How well did your model work for Alabama and Alaska? Why didn't it work as well for other states?
- How can we measure "how well a model fits"?
}

@teacher{Confirm that students were able to successfully compute slope and y-intercept, define and test `f(x)` in Pyret, and evaluate the predictive value of `f(x)`.}

The real world is noisy and chaotic! But sometimes, somewhere in that noise and chaos there are _patterns_, which we can describe with _models_. Finding those models may not help us predict the future, but they can at least help us reason about it! In the previous section, we came up with a number of different linear models for the relationship between `pct-college-or-higher` and `median-income`. But which is the best model?

*How do we even measure how good a model is in the first place?*

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- TODO(Emmanuel): workbook page with simple points and two functions. Kids have to come up with a measurement
- Share back
}

Pyret includes a function called `fit-model`. Find its Contract on the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Page}. @pathway-only{_If you're working with a printed workbook, the contracts pages are included in the back._} Like `scatter-plot`, it consumes columns for our _labels_, our @math{x}s and our @math{y}s. However, it _also consumes a function!_ It produces a scatter plot, with the function graphed on top of it.

@teacher{Sometimes a value has too many digits to be displayed clearly. When this happens, Pyret will convert it to *scientific notation*. While students in an Algebra 2 class will likely have encountered scientific notation before, they may not recognize @math{8.23e5} as @math{8.23 \times 10^5}. You should make sure they understand how to interpret this notation.}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income-2.adoc}.
- Based on the @vocab{S} values of the plots you created on this page, what do you think @vocab{S} means?
}

@right{@image{images/residual.png, 200}}Each datapoint has an @math{(x,y)} value, and your model tries to predict what @math{y} will be based on @math{x}. When you graph your model in Pyret, you can see that some of the points are close to the line ("real" @math{y} is close to "predicted" @math{y}). But some points are quite far away ("real" @math{y} is far to "predicted" @math{y})!

The distance between any real @math{y} and predicted @math{y} is called the @vocab{residual}, and it measures how far off that one point in the model is from the actual data.

@slidebreak
@ifslide{@right{@image{images/residual.png, 200}}}The statistical term @vocab{S} refers to the @vocab{Standard Deviation of the Residuals}, which is a measure of how far away _all_ of data points are from the models you built. The closer they are to the model, the smaller the residuals are. Smaller residuals mean a smaller @vocab{S}, and a better model!

@slidebreak
@ifslide{@right{@image{images/residual.png, 200}}} There are many different tools to calculate the fitness of a model. @ifnotslide{You may even have heard of @math{R}, @math{R^2}, etc...}

Statisticians and Data Scientists are careful to use the right tool for the job. In this case, the tool we're going to use is called the @vocab{Standard Deviation of the Residuals}, or @vocab{S}.

A Statistics class would spend some time talking about what a @vocab{residual} is, and how to compute @vocab{Standard Deviation}. But for our purposes, we can just use the value of @vocab{S} to tell us how well or poorly our model fits.

@slidebreak
@ifslide{@right{@image{images/residual.png, 200}}}

@QandA{
@Q{If a point falls exactly on the line, what would the value of the residual for that point be?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{Where would the data points be if a model _fit the all of the data perfectly?_}
@A{All of the datapoints would fall precisely on the line.}
@Q{What would the value of @vocab{S} be?}
@A{Zero}
}

@strategy{Going Deeper}{

Discussion of @vocab{S} and @vocab{Residuals} may be appropriate for older students, or in an AP Statistics class. There's also an entire Bootstrap lesson on @lesson-link{standard-deviation}. TODO(Emmanuel): Add a good reference for this, and maybe even a lesson on residuals!
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete the first section ("Build a Model through Trial and Error") on @printable-exercise{model-college-v-income-3.adoc}.
- What was the best model (lowest @vocab{S}!) you could come up with?
}

@opt{
Pyret has a function that will compute @vocab{S} without drawing the graph. This may be useful, especially for students who are struggling with scientific notation:

@show{(contract 'S '((t Table) (label String) (xs String) (ys String) (model Number->Number)) "Number")}
}

@slidebreak

But how do we find the _best possible model?_ In Statistics, an algorithm called linear regression is used to derive the slope and y-intercept of the best possible model by taking every datapoint into account. Pyret has a function that will do just that, called `lr-plot`.

@lesson-instruction{

}

@strategy{More `lr-plot` material}{

If you'd like to have students dig deeper into linear regression, there's an @lesson-link{linear-regression, entire lesson} you can use that spends more time interpreting results and writing about findings. This lesson also includes a discussion of @math{R^2}, a different measure of model fitness.
}

@slidebreak

When we interpret a model, we try to make sense of the slope, the axes, the @math{S} value, and the real data behind them. In this example, _a model built from Alaska and Alabama predicts that a 1 percent increase in college degrees is associated with a *$5613* increase in median household income._

@lesson-instruction{
- The @math{S} value is *$36,300*. Does that mean the model fits well?
- As a class or in groups, discuss and be ready to share back.
}

@slidebreak

The lowest median incomes are found in Mississippi ($39.031), Arkansas ($40,768), and West Virginia ($41,043).

An @vocab{S} value of $36,300 means there's enough error in the model to predict $0 median incomes for these states, or to over-estimate and predict _double_ the median income! And a family in Maryland - with the highest median income of $73,538 - might be predicted to only earn half as much, or 50% more!

Compared to the size of the incomes in this dataset, an @vocab{S} value of $36,300 is pretty terrible. _This model should not be trusted!_

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
These models are useless if we can't make sense of them!

== (Optional) Other Forms of Linear Models @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are reminded of the three forms of linear models available to us, discuss when and why we might choose one form over another, and practice translating between them.

=== Launch

When trying to fit a piece into a puzzle, sometimes we rotate the piece to see it from a different angle. When fitting a model to a dataset, we might prefer to look at the linear relationship from different angles as well! 

So far, we've focused on models using the *Slope-Intercept* form of the line. That's because it's the form that is defined in terms of the response variable, making it most compatible with the programming environment.

But depending on the information we have available to us - or who we're writing this model for - we might want to use _other_ forms of linear models. Fortunately, we can always translate any model into another!

@slidebreak

You may already be familiar with the different forms of linear models available to us:

[cols="^5a,^6a,^5a", options="header"]
|===
| Slope-Intercept		| Point-Slope				| Standard
| @math{y = mx+b}		| @math{y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)}	| @math{Ax+By = C}
<| 
- m: slope
- b: y-intercept
<|
- m: slope
- @math{y_1}: y-coordinate of a point
- @math{x_1}: x-coordinate of the same point
<|
- x-int: @math{\frac{C}{A}}
- y-int: @math{\frac{C}{B}}
- slope: @math{- \frac{A}{B}}
|===

@slidebreak

(1) *Slope-Intercept Form* makes it really easy to read the slope and y-intercept.

(2) *Point-Slope Form* makes it easy to find the equation of the line given a single point and slope.

(3) *Standard Form* makes it easy to find the x- and y-intercepts of the line.

@teacher{Pose the questions below to assess student understanding of when and why we might choose one form over another.}

Why we might choose to use one form over another?

@QandA{
@Q{Suppose our scatterplot has a state with 0% college enrollment, and another with 0% median income. Which linear model form would be easiest to build?}
@A{Standard Form}
@Q{Suppose we only know the slope of a model, but we know the college graduation rate _and_ median income for Rhode Island. Which form would make it easy to figure out the rest of the model?}
@A{Point-Slope Form}
@Q{Which form makes it easiest to define our model in Pyret?}
@A{Slope-Intercept Form}
}

=== Investigate

While it's easier to write one linear form or the other based on the information available to us, and might be easier for someone else to extract the information they're looking for based on the model we supply them with, we can easily translate back and forth between linear forms!

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's practice writing linear functions in each of the forms and translating them into Pyret function definitions.
- Turn to @printable-exercise{which-form.adoc}
- When you're done, add your function definitions to your @starter-file{alg2-states} and test them out with `fit-model`.

=== Synthesize
If you needed to draw the graph of a linear model, which form would you like to start from? Why?

== Investigating Horizontal and Vertical Shifts @duration{optional}

=== Overview

In preparation for work with quadratic, exponential and logarithmic functions, students explore the relationship between horizontal and vertical shifts of linear functions. Written exercises accompany an interactive Desmos slider activity we've created.

=== Launch

Lines can be shifted up, down, left and right by adding and subtracting to their definitions. Let's see if we can decode the pattern! 

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @opt-printable-exercise{horizontal-shift.adoc}, which will guide you through the Desmos activity: @opt-online-exercise{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hong7gv82k, Exploring Horizontal and Linear Shifts in Linear Functions} step by step.
- As you work through the activities, pay careful attention to directions telling you know which graphs to turn "on" and "off" for each section.

@teacher{There are 3 folders in this Desmos activity. Students will be opening them one at a time by clicking on the triangles and then turning the lines defined within them on and off as directed using the circles in front of the folders.}

@opt{These two paper and pencil exercises guide students through thinking about how horizontal and vertical shifts are related, depending on whether a line has a positive or negative slope:

- @opt-printable-exercise{hor-vert-shift-positive.adoc}
- @opt-printable-exercise{hor-vert-shift-negative.adoc}
}

=== Synthesize

What did you discover about recognizing horizontal and vertical shifts from linear equations?
