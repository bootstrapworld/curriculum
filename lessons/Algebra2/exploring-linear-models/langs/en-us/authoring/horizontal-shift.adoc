= Identifying Horizonal and Vertical Shifts from Linear Functions Definitions

Open the @online-exercise{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hong7gv82k, Exploring Horizontal and Linear Shifts in Linear Functions} file.

There are three exercise folders in the file. You will be directed to focus on one folder at a time.

@vspace{1ex}

== Exploration 1

_Click on the triangle to open the folder, and the circle to turn "on" the graphs it contains._

@n Move the slider to change the value of @math{h}, paying attention to the x-intercepts of the lines. What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As @math{h} gets bigger, the x-intercepts of the lines shift to the right. As @math{h} gets smaller they shift to the left.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n *Turn "off" @math{g(x)} so that only the red line is visible.* Move the slider to change the value of @math{h}, paying attention to the y-intercept of the line.

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This function has a positive slope.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As @math{h} gets bigger, the y-intercept moves down the y-axis. @math{h} ranges from -10 to 10, but the y-intercept ranges from -7 to 7.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n *Turn @math{g(x)} back "on" and turn "off" @math{f(x)} so that only the blue line is visible.* Move the slider to change the value of @math{h}.

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{This function has a negative slope.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As @math{h} gets bigger, the y-intercept moves up the y-axis. Just like with the other line, @math{h} ranges from -10 to 10 & the y-int ranges from -7 to 7.}}

== Exploration 2

_Close and turn "off" Exploration 1. Then open and turn "on" Exploration 2._

@n *If you leave the slider at @math{b = 0},* what is the y-intercept of the purple line? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-4}}

@n How could we find the y-intercept from looking at the function definition: @math{j(x) = 2x - 4} ?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The function definition ends with @math{-4}.}}

@n *When @math{b = 0},* what is the y-intercept of the green line? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-8}}

@n How could we find the y-intercept from looking at the function definition:  @math{k(x) = 2(x - 4) + 0} ?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We could multiply 2 times -4 to get -8}}

@n Slide @math{b} until the green line lands on top of the purple line. What is the value of @math{b}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4}}

@n How could we have found this value of @math{b} without using the slider?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{b = 4} is the value that we add to @math{-8} (the starting y-intercept of the green line) to get @math{-4} (the y-intercept of the purple line)}}

== Exploration 3

_Close and turn "off" Exploration 2. Then open and turn "on" Exploration 3._

@n Using the strategy you articulated in question 9, what value of @math{c} would make this pair of lines land on top of each other? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{3}}}

_Show your work._

@ifsoln{@math{0.25 \times 4 = 1} @hspace{7em} @math{4 -1 = 3}}
