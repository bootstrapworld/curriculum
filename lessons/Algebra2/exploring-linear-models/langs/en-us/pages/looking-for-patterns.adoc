@n What columns do you think might be related to one another? (e.g. - is the number of veterans related the amount of land-area? Is the population in 2010 related to the population in 2020?) List three possible relationships below.

@hspace{1em} +a.+ I think that @fitb{25em}{} may be related to @fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +b.+ I think that @fitb{25em}{} may be related to @fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +c.+ I think that @fitb{25em}{} may be related to @fitb{}{}

*The contract for scatter-plot is:* +
 @show{(contract 'scatter-plot '("Table" (labels String) (explanatory String) (response String)) "Image")}


**Using this contract, make a scatter plot for each of the three relationships you listed. Find your home state, and its neighbors! How do they compare?**

@n Use this contract to make a scatter-plot for the **first relationship** you wrote above. Find your home state, and its neighbors.

@hspace{1em} +a.+ How do they compare? @fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +b.+ If there's a pattern in this scatter-plot, what does that mean? If there isn't, what does _that_ mean? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Use this contract to make a scatter-plot for the **second relationship** you wrote above. Find your home state, and its neighbors.

@hspace{1em} +a.+ How do they compare? @fitb{}{}

@hspace{1em} +b.+ If there's a pattern in this scatter-plot, what does that mean? If there isn't, what does _that_ mean? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n For the three relationships in Question 3....

- Place a star by any relationships that you think might be linear.
- Place a "P" by any relationships that were positive.
- Place an "N" by any relationships that were negative.
- Place an "S" by the strongest-looking relationship.
- Place a "W" by the weakest-looking relationship.
