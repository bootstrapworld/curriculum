= Exploring the States Dataset

For this page, you'll need to open the @starter-file{alg2-states} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Click "Run" and type `states-table` into the Interactions Area on the right to see the dataset.

@n What code will produce a table showing the number of states in each region? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(count states-table "region"))}}}

@n _Which states do you *think* have the most people?_ What code will produce a table containing the five states with the largest population in 2020? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(first-n-rows (sort states-table "pop-2020" false) 4))}}}

@n _Which states do you *think* have the highest poverty?_ What code will produce a table containing the ten states with the highest poverty rate? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(first-n-rows (sort states-table "poverty-rate" true) 10))}}}

@n What code will produce a table containing the states with the lowest *median* income? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(sort states-table "median-income" false))}}}

@n What code will produce a table containing the states with the lowest *per-capita* ("average" or "mean") income?? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(sort states-table "per-capita-income" false))}}}

@star What does it mean if a state has a higher `per-capita income` than `median-income`? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The state has a number of "high-earning outliers", which skew the average}}

The two lines of code under `# Define some rows` *extract rows 0 and 1 from the table, and define them as `alabama` and `alaska`*.

@n Type `alabama` into the Interactions Area. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just the Row for Alabama}}

@n Underneath the definition of those rows, *add a new definition* for `california`. Be sure to *click "Run"*, so that Pyret reads your new definition!

@n **Add a definition for your own state**!
