@n Lines 13 and 14 *extract rows 0 and 1 from the table, and define them as `alabama` and `alaska`*. Type `alabama` into the Interactions Area. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just the Row for Alabama}}


@n What columns do you think might be related to one another? (e.g. - is the number of veterans related the amount of land-area? Is the population in 2010 related to the population in 2020?) List three possible relationships below.

+a.+ I think that @fitb{25em}{} may be related to @fitb{}{}

+b.+ I think that @fitb{25em}{} may be related to @fitb{}{}

@center{**Reminder:** @show{(contract 'scatter-plot (list "Table" "String" "String" "String") "Image")}}

@n For each of the relationships you listed, make a scatter plot using those columns. What do you think each display tells you about the relationship between those two columns?

+a.+ @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

+b.+ @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}
