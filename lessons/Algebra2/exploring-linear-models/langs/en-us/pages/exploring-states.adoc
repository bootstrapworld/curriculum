= Exploring the States Dataset

[.linkInstructions]
Open the @starter-file{alg2-states} and *Save a Copy* of the file that's just for you.

Then, click "Run" and type `states-table` into the Interactions Area on the right to see the dataset.

@n What code will produce a table showing the number of states in each region? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(count states-table "region"))}}}

@n Which states do you *think* have the most people? @fitb{}{}

@n What code will produce a table containing the five states with the largest population in 2020? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(first-n-rows (sort states-table "pop-2020" false) 5))}}}

@n Which states do you *think* have the most poverty? @fitb{}{}

@n What code will produce a table containing the ten states with the highest poverty rate? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(first-n-rows (sort states-table "pct-poverty" false) 10))}}}

@n What code will produce a table containing the states with the lowest *median* income? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(sort states-table "median-income" false))}}}

@n What code will produce a table containing the states with the lowest *per-capita* ("average" or "mean") income? +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@show{(code '(sort states-table "per-capita-income" false))}}}

@star What does it mean if a state has a higher `per-capita income` than `median-income`? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The state has a number of "high-earning outliers", which skew the average}}

_The two lines of code under `# Define some rows` extract rows 0 and 1 from the table, and define them as `alabama` and `alaska`._

@n Type `alabama` into the Interactions Area. What do you get back? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Just the Row for Alabama}}

@n Underneath the definition of those rows, add a new definition for `california` and click "Run", so that Pyret reads your new definition.

@n Add a definition for your own state, then *click "Run"* and test it out in the Interactions Area!

@n Add any additional Notices or Wonderings you have about this dataset to the table at the top.
