= Shifting Linear Functions

Open this @online-exercise{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hong7gv82k} file. 

There are three exercise folders in the file. As we move through this page you will be directed to focus on one folder at a time.

*Exploration 1:*

_Click on the circle and the triangle in front of the Exploration 1 folder to turn "on" the graphs and see what's in the folder._ 

@n Experiment moving the slider to change the value of @math{h}. What do you notice? What do you wonder?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As @math{h} gets bigger, the x-intercepts of the lines shift to the right. As @math{h} gets smaller they shift to the left.}}

@fitb{}{}

@n Turn off @math{g(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x + 2} so that only the red line is visible. 

Experiment moving the slider to change the value of @math{h}. What do you notice? What do you wonder?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{This function has a positive slope.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As @math{h} gets bigger, the y-intercept moves down the y-axis. @math{h} ranges from -10 to 10, but the y-intercept ranges from -7 to 7.}}

@n Turn @math{g(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x + 2} back on and turn off @math{f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x + 2} so that only the blue line is visible. 

Experiment moving the slider to change the value of @math{h}. What do you notice? What do you wonder?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{This function has a negative slope.}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As @math{h} gets bigger, the y-intercept moves up the y-axis. Just like with the other line, @math{h} ranges from -10 to 10 & the y-int ranges from -7 to 7.}}

_Before you move on, make sure that some of your notices & wonders reference the y-intercepts and some explore changes in the x-intercepts._

*Exploration 2:*

_Close and turn "off" Exploration 1. Then open and turn "on" Exploration 2._

@n What is the y-intercept of the purple line? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-4}}

@n How could we find the y-intercept from looking at the function definition: @math{j(x) = 2x - 4} ?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the function definition ends with @math{-4}.}}

@vspace{1ex}

_Make sure @math{b} is still set to zero before answering questions 6 and 7._ 

@n What is the y-intercept of the green line? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-8}}

@n How could we find the y-intercept from looking at the function definition:  @math{k(x) = 2(x - 4) + b} ? 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We could multiply 2 times -4 to get -8}}

@n Slide @math{b} until the green line lands on top of the purple line. What is the value of @math{b}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{4}}

@n How could you have found the value of @math{b} that would land the lines on top of each other without using the slider?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{b = 4} is the value that we add to @math{-8} (the starting y-intercept of the green line) to get @math{-4} (the y-intercept of the purple line)}}

@vspace{1ex}

*Exploration 3:*

_Close and turn "off" Exploration 2. Then open and turn "on" Exploration 3._

@n Use the strategy you articulated in question 9 to figure out what value of @math{c} would make this pair of lines land on top of each other. 

(_Show your calculations here. Then confirm that your method works using the slider._)

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{@math{0.25 \times 4 = 1} @hspace{7em} @math{4 -1 = 3}}}
