Match the description (left) with the scatter plot (right).

_Note: The computer won't tell us if the relationship we see is linear, so we must train our eyes to decide this ourselves. For linear relationships, we should train our eyes to assess their direction and get a feel for their strength, rather than relying completely on what numbers the computer reports._

@ifsoln{*TEACHERS: We've run linear regression on these to help YOU visualize the correlations.  Students have NOT YET been introduced to lr-plots.*}
