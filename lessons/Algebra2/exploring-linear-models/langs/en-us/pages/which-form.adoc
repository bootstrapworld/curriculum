= Which Form is Best?

For each set of data provided below, 

- Decide which form of the line would be the easiest to build from the available information.
- Write a definition of the linear model in that form.
- Translate the definition into Pyret notation.
- Add the Pyret definition to your copy of @starter-file{alg2-states}.
