== The `al-ak` Model

_Type @show{(code '(fit-model states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income" al-ak))} in the Interactions Area, then find the points for AL and AK along the predictor line. _Hint: You know their coordinates and they will help you know where to look!_

@n What do you Notice?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. AL and AK are both on the line, but they don't seem to be very representative of the group.}} 

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The line goes all the way up to $200,000 but median income doesn't seem to exceed $80000.}}

@n What do you Wonder?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answers will vary. What states might have been more representative of the trend?}} 

@fitb{}{}

@n Find @math{S} in the upper left corner. What is the @math{S} value (the number after @math{S})? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~9930.59}}

== Other Models

In the definitions area, find the section titled _Define some other models by modifying al-ak_. +

- For now, all three definitions in this section are exactly the same as `al-ak`.
- You will be changing them according to the directions below.

@n If you wanted the model to be _less steep_, what slope could you use? @fitb{}{}

- Change the definition for `less-steep` to use the slope you wrote above.

  * Click "Run" to load your new definition. In the Interactions Area type: @show{(code '(fit-model states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income" less-steep))}
  * What is the @math{S} value of `less-steep`? @fitb{}{}

- Identify a y-intercept that would make the model fit the data better: @fitb{}{}

  * Adjust the definition to use the new y-intercept and click "Run".
  * Hit the up arrow in the Interactions Area and click return/Enter to fit the model again.
  * What is the @math{S} value of `less-steep` now? @fitb{}{}

@n Change the definition of `negative` so that it models the data with a slope that is _negative_.

  * Click "Run" and type the code to fit this model to the data.
  * What slope did you use? @fitb{10em}{} What is the @math{S} value now? @fitb{}{}

@n Change the definition of `horizontal` so that it draws a horizontal model. Click "Run" and fit this model. What is the @math{S} value? @fitb{}{}

@n Change the y-intercept so that the horizontal line passes through more of the points. Click "Run" and fit this model.

  * What y-intercept did you use? @fitb{10em}{} What is the @math{S} value now? @fitb{}{}

@n What do you think @math{S} tells us? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It measures how well the model fits the data}}
