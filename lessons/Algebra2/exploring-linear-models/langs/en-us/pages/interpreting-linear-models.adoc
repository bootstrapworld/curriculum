**We started with a model based on Alabama and Alaska. We can interpret the slope and @math{R^2} value below:**

[.example]
--
The @fitbruby{20em}{Alabama-Alaska}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{percent}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{percent college degrees}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{5613 dollar}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{increase}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. Based on the @math{R^2} of @fitbruby{10em}{-15.63}{R^2^ value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{really, really poorly}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}.

@n Describe the optimal model YOU created via linear regression:

The @fitbruby{20em}{linear-regression}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{percent}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{percent college degrees}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{1142 dollar}}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. With an @math{R^2} of @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{.585}}{R^2^ value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{pretty well}}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}.

@n What does the **slope** of this linear model tell us? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The amount by which median income increases for each percentage of citizens who finished college}}

@n What does the **y-intercept** of a linear model tell us? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The median income of a state with no college graduates}}

@n Suppose a state goes from 10% to 11% college graduation. According to this model, what kind of change would we expect to see in the median household income? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{$1142}} What if it goes from 50% to 51%? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{$1142}} From 90% to 91%? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{$1142}}

@n Does this model predict the same increase in income for __every__ additional 1% `college-or-higher`? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Linear models increase by equal amounts over all equal intervals}}

@n Use `fit-model` to fit your model to the scatter plot again, but **swap the x- and y-columns**. Do you get the same @math{R^2}? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes, because every point is reflected across the line, and a the distance from each point to a straight line is the same.}}

@n Describe another model you created:

The @fitbruby{20em}{}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{percent}}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{@ifsoln{percent college degrees}}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{1142 dollar}}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{@ifsoln{median household income}}{[y-axis]}. With an @math{R^2} of @fitbruby{10em}{}{R^2^ value}, model fits @fitbruby{15em}{}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}.
