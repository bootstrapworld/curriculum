== Build a Model Computationally

`lr-plot` computes the _optimal linear model_ using all of the data points.

@n Evaluate @show{(code '(lr-plot states-table "state" "pct-college-or-higher" "median-income"))}. What is @math{S}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

@n On the line below, write the optimal linear model that was computed through linear regression:

@center{
 @math{optimal(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{@math{1142}}}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{20868.14}}{y-intercept} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (optimal x) (+ (* (?ANS 1142) x) (?ANS 20868.14))))}
}

== Interpret the Model

*We started with a model based on Alabama and Alaska. We can interpret the slope and @math{S}-value below:*

[.example]
--
The @fitbruby{20em}{Alabama-Alaska}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{percent}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{percent college degrees}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{5613 dollar}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{increase}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. Based on the @math{S-value} of @fitbruby{10em}{~36,164.68}{S-value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{really, really poorly}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}.

@n Describe the optimal model YOU created via linear regression:

The @fitbruby{20em}{linear-regression}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{percent}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{percent college degrees}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{1142 dollar}}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. With an @math{S}-value of @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~9,930.58}}{S-value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{pretty well}}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}.


@n What does the *slope* of this linear model tell us? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The amount by which median income increases for each percentage of citizens who finished college}}

@n What does the *y-intercept* of this linear model tell us? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The median income of a state with no college graduates}}

@n Suppose a state goes from 10% to 11% college graduation. According to this model, 

  * What kind of change would we expect to see in the median household income? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{$1142}} 
  * What if it goes from 50% to 51%? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{$1142}}
  * What if it goes from 90% to 91%? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{$1142}}

@n Does this model predict the same increase in income for _every_ additional 1% `college-or-higher`? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Yes. Linear models increase by equal amounts over all equal intervals}}

@fitb{}{}
