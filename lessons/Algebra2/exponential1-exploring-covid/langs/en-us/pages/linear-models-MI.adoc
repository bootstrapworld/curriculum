@n Evaluate `covid-table` and `MI-table` in the Interactions Area. How are these tables different? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`MI-table` only has rows from Michigan}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n In the Definitions Area, find the definition of `is-MI` and `MI-table`. What are these things? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A new function is being defined, which is used to filter `covid-table` and produce a new table with only MI rows}}

@n Make a scatter plot from the `MI-table`, using `state` as the labels, and `days` and `positive` as the x- and y-axis. Sketch the plot below.

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the _best-possible linear model_ for the MI Covid data, *graph it* on the plot above, and *define it* below:

@indented{
y = @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{@math{1264.92x + 107984}}} @hspace{3em} @math{S =} @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{77,135}}
}

@n The optimized linear model for this dataset predicts an @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} of about @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{1265}}{slope} @fitbruby{9em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} per @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{day}}{x-variable}. +
@indented{The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{77,135}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{units}, which is a @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{so-so}}{poor, so-so, good} fit considering that @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{0}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{551,498}}{highest y-value}.}

@n Change the definition of the `linear` function in the @starter-file{alg2-covid} to match the model produced by `lr-plot` and "Save".

@n Do you think a linear function is a good fit for this dataset? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +

@blanklines{3}{}

@star What do you think the code that defines `MI-table` is actually doing? @fitb{}{}
