@n Evaluate `covid-table` and `MA-table` in the Interactions Area. How are these tables different? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`MA-table` only has rows from MA}} +

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A new function is being defined, which is used to filter `covid-table` and produce a new table with only MA rows}}

@n Make a scatter plot from the `MA-table`, using `state` as the labels, and `day` and `positive` as the x- and y-axis. Sketch the plot below.

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the _best-possible linear model_ for the MA Covid data, *graph it* on the plot above, and *define it* below:

@indented{
y = @fitb{25em}{@ifsoln{@math{845.617x + 6.94e4} @hspace{2em} or @hspace{2em} @math{845.617x + 69400}}} @hspace{3em} @math{S =} @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{3.18e4  @hspace{2em} or  @hspace{2em} 31800}}
}

@n The optimized linear model for this dataset predicts an @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} of about @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{846}}{slope} @fitbruby{9em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} per @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{day}}{x-variable}. +
@indented{The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{31800}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{units}, which is a @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{bad}}{poor, ok, good} fit considering that @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{104156}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{341925}}{highest y-value}.}

@n Change the definition of the `linear` function in the @starter-file{alg2-covid} to match the model produced by `lr-plot` and "Save".

@n Do you think a linear function is a good fit for this dataset? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +
