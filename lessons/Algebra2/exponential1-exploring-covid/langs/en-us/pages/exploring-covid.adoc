For this page, you'll need to have the @starter-file{alg2-covid} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.
}

@n Take a look at the Definitions Area and find the "Notes on Columns". What is the start date for the data in this table? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Early January, 2020}}

@n Click "Run", and evaluate `covid-table` in the Interactions Area. What do you notice? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There is data for the number of positive COVID cases each day for 6 states (CA, MN, MI, WI, IL, and OH)}}

@n Evaluate `CA15` in the Interactions Area. What does it return? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A single row of the table.}}

@n Evaluate `MI64`. What information do you learn? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{64 days after 1/1/20, the state of Michigan had 2 reported positive covid cases.}}

@n Evaluate `IL15`. Why is it "unbound" and how could we make it work? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{There are only definitions for `CA15`, `CA22` and `MI64`}}

@n Define three new Rows called `IL15`, `MI15` and `MN15`, showing the data 15 days into 2020 for Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. Click "Run" and test them out.

@hspace{3em}+a.+ How many people in *Illinois* had tested positive by January 16th, 2020? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{0}} +
@hspace{3em}+b.+ How many people in *Michigan* tested positive by January 16th, 2020? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{0}} +
@hspace{3em}+c.+ How many people in *Minnesota* tested positive by January 16th, 2020? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{0}}

@n In Pyret, make a scatter plot from `covid-table` showing the relationship between `day` and `positive`, and using `state` as your labels. Sketch the resulting scatter plot below.
