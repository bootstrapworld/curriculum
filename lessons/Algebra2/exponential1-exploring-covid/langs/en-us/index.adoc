@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. + 
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-covid-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are synced to you and only able to interact with the slide for the lesson section you are working on.

== Exploring the Data
@objective{model-explore}

=== Overview

Students explore the Covid dataset, focusing on the growth in positive test cases for the state of Massachusetts (they will eventually explore other states later on).

=== Launch

In late 2019, COVID-19 began to spread across the globe. Most of us heard terms like "flatten the curve" and "infection rate" in videos and on the news.

Even in 2020, very few people could have predicted the impact Covid would have on the world. But Data Scientists who were looking at the data knew differently. Let's take a look at some of that data!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- We're going to look at the daily total of confirmed, positive cases for New England (Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut) from summer 2020 until the end of the year..
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-covid}, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run."
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{exploring-covid.adoc}.
}

@strategy{Why just New England, starting from June 9th?!?}{

This dataset is @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T73KS2IUU1kkG1SY4Ac7EU9Lj-ev1U9vzM_txSYcUhE/, available for all 50 states (and Washington, D.C!)}, but for pedagogical purposes we've written the starter file to pull only data from New England.

And even within New England, we've _artificially constrained this dataset_, showing only the data from June 9th to December 26th, 2020. We've made this choice in order to showcase the most purely-exponential behavior of the infection curve, for the sake of this lessons' math learning goals.

For students who are farther along in mathematics, we recommend showing them _all_ the data through 2020, starting in January rather than June. The first portion of the infection curve shows a gradual, linear growth pattern before exploding in the Fall of 2020. A purely exponential function will under-predict the growth during this time period, adding significant friction to the exponential modeling goal of this unit!

(The functions necessary to model this kind of growth have multiple terms showing different kinds of growth, and are just out of reach for students right now. Students can _return_ to this unit once they've learned about @lesson-link{periodic4-hybrid-models, hybrid models} in later lessons.)

Based on the strength of your students, we encourage you to choose the data that best fits your learning goals.

To use all available data, open the @starter-file{alg2-covid} and change the source sheet on line 7 from `"New England"` to `"All"`

=== Synthesize

@lesson-instruction{
@right{@image{images/multiple-models.png, 350}}
Discuss in groups or pairs, and prepare to share out to the class:

- Based on the look of the scatter plot you just made, do you think there's a strong relationship here?
- If we fit a curve or straight line to this data, do you think it would fit the scatter plot well?
}

@teacher{
Review student answers to confirm that students have made a number of observations:

- There appears to be _more than one_ relationship in this dataset.
- Every relationship appears to be extremely strong.
- Most/all of these relationships appear to be nonlinear.
}

== Fitting Linear Models
@objective{model-fit-function}

=== Overview
Students use Pyret to perform linear regression on the data from Massachusetts and discuss whether or not the optimal linear model is a good fit for the data.

=== Launch
Let's start out by looking at _just one state_. We'll use Massachusetts for this investigation, but you can do your own investigation about any state you like after finishing this one!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{linear-models.adoc}.
}

The definition @show{(code '(define MA-table (filter covid-table is-MA)))} _filters_ our dataset, keeping only the rows for which `state = "MA"`. We could create other helper functions like `is-MA`, and use them with the `filter` function to get datasets for any state we want!

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{Did you see a correlation between date and the total number of confirmed, positive cases in this dataset?}
@A{Yes}
@Q{Describe its @vocab{form}, @vocab{direction}, and @vocab{strength}.}
@A{Sample response: It's definitely strong and appears to be non-linear. Non-linear functions don't usually have direction, so not sure about that one.}
}

@slidebreak

Linear models capture _straight-line relationships_, where one quantity varies proportionally based on another. In linear models, we expect the response variable to grow by equal amounts over equal intervals in the explanatory variable.

@QandA{
@Q{Are linear models a good fit for this data?}
@Q{Why or why not?}
}

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@right{@image{images/MA-covid-linear.png, 300}}If we make the line go from the start to the peak of the curve (top line), almost all of the points bulge out below our line of best fit. +
If we make the line hit the _bottom_ of the curve, all the points fall above it (bottom line).

@slidebreak{InvestigateR}

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/MA-covid-linear.png, 300}}}Splitting the difference (orange line) is better than both of those options, and we might even get a halfway decent @math{S}! +
But ultimately, straight-line, linear models just don't behave like this curve, and we'll never get the _best-possible fit_ with them. +
*The number of positive cases is growing too fast to be fit with a linear model that grows at a constant rate!*

=== Synthesize
- Would a linear model fit just the first few months of the data?
- If we _only_ knew about first few weeks, would it be ok to use a linear model? Why or why not?


== Fitting Quadratic Models
@objective{model-fit-function}

=== Overview
Students try to fit a quadratic model to this data. This section makes heavy use of interactive slider activities we've built in Desmos to support open-ended experimentation. The ultimate goal is that students discover the need for models beyond linear and quadratic functions.

=== Launch

Maybe linear isn't the way to go, here!

@teacher{
Make sure you've:

- Clicked on "pacing" and set your teacher dashboard of @starter-file{alg2-covid-desmos} to the first slide so that students are looking at the "Quadratic Models" screen
- Generated your own link in Desmos for sharing the file with your students
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the *Desmos* link I shared with you to the *Modeling Covid Spread* file. 
- You should be on Slide 1 (Quadratic Models).
- Using the file, complete @printable-exercise{quadratic-models.adoc}
}

@teacher{Have students share their resulting models. Which one fits best?}

@slidebreak

In quadratic models, one quantity varies based on the _square_ of another. Unlike linear models that grow evenly, we expect the response variable to grow by different amounts over equal intervals in the explanatory variable.

@QandA{
@Q{Are quadratic models a good fit for this data?}
@Q{Why or why not?}
}

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/MA-covid-quadratic.png, 300}}Quadratic models change their rate of growth over time, which definitely makes them a better fit for this data than linear ones. It's very likely we could find a quadratic model with a lower @vocab{S-value} than our linear model! +
But this data starts out almost flat and then suddenly takes off like a rocket - quadratic models just don't have that kind of explosive growth, so our model will never be as good as it _could_ be.

=== Synthesize

- This data grows very slowly in the beginning and then grows very quickly. Can you think of any other situations in real life that act like this?
- Can you think of any graphs that might act like this?
