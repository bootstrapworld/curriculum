@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on the same custom-built interactive Desmos activity we introduced in @lesson-link{logarithmic1-exploring-wealth-health}.
 * Set the pacing so that students are synced to you and only able to interact with the slide for the lesson section you are working on.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * If you don't already have a code, or you want to share a new one, you will first want to:
 *** Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 *** Make a link or code to share with your students.
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

== Fitting by Transforming Data
@objective{model-fit-function}
@objective{linearize-inverse}

=== Overview
Having discovered that changing the scale of a graph allows us to _see_ logarithmic growth as linear, but still doesn't allow us to _treat_ it as linear, students learn to *transform the data* by applying a function to each row and building a new column that can be fit with a linear model.

Note: this also opens the door for teaching inverse functions!

=== Launch

We've seen that changing the scale on the x-axis from linear to logarithmic cancels out the logarithmic behavior by _shrinking the x-axis_ to have intervals that grow exponentially and squishing the points to appear linear.

@slidebreak

Instead of plotting `pc-gdp` on a _logarithmic_ x-axis, we could *transform the x-coordinates themselves* and plot `log(pc-gdp)` on a _linear_ x-axis.  This would allow us to be able to use linear regression to obtain an optimal linear model!

@slidebreak

@teacher{Sync or pace students to *Slide 8: Wealth-v-Health (Transformed)* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models Desmos file*.
- You should now be on Slide 8: "Wealth-v-Health (Transformed)".
- Use it to complete @printable-exercise{transforming-data.adoc}.

@QandA{
@Q{What values did you come up with for @math{m} and @math{b} in your best-guess linear model?}
@A{Record different students' responses for @math{m} and @math{b} on the board.}
@A{These numbers should be somewhat close to their earlier responses for @math{a} and @math{k}!}
@Q{Were those values very similar to or very different from our best-guess logarithmic model?}
@Q{How was transforming the data similar to changing the scale on the x-axis?}
@A{Transforming the data and changing the scale both made the logarithmic relationship look linear.}
@Q{How was it different?}
@A{Changing the scale just made things *look* linear, but the data wasn't any different.}

@lesson-point{

- the *slope* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *log coefficient* in the un-transformed logarithmic model

- the *vertical shift* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *vertical shift* in the un-transformed logarithmic model
}

=== Investigate


Now that we know how the model settings in our linear model of transformed data relate to the model settings in our logarithmic model, let's return to Pyret to run linear regression on the transformed data, find the *best possible linear model*, and use the model settings to define our *optimal _logarithmic_ model!*

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Open @starter-file{alg2-countries}, and turn to @printable-exercise{logarithmic-models.adoc}.
- Complete the first part ("Transforming: From Logarithmic Plots to Linear Ones"), then pause for class discussion.
}

We transformed the data in three steps:

1. Define the transformation function @math{g(r)} to produce the log of the `pc-gdp` column.
2. Build a new column `log(pc-gdp)` that gets populated by applying @math{g(r)} to transform each of our original x-values.
3. Use the new column as the @vocab{explanatory variable} on the x-axis for our scatter plot.

@teacher{Address any student questions about `build-column`, the Pyret function they've just discovered. Verify that students have recorded the slope and vertical shift for their regression line. Then, emphasize the key ideas below.}

@slidebreak

- At each point in our linear model, @math{y} is the _predicted median lifespan_, and @math{x} is the _log of per-capita gdp in dollars_.
- We want @math{x} to represent the *original, un-transformed* value, simply using _per-capita gdp in thousands_ as-is...

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Now let's find our optimized @vocab{logarithmic model}.
- Complete the second part ("Inverting: From Linear Models to Logarithmic Ones") of @printable-exercise{logarithmic-models.adoc}.
}

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/lr-plot-transformed.png, 350}}Just like in Desmos, transforming the `pc-gdp` column with a log function produces a scatter plot showing a linear pattern in the data! +
@vspace{1ex} +
Pyret's `lr-plot` tool computes the best possible linear model for our transformed data: +
@indented{@math{y = 11.9011x + ~59.967}} 
Our @math{S} has dropped to 4.49, showing a much better correlation than before.

@clear

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/logarithmic-model.png, 350}}From @printable-exercise{transforming-data.adoc}, we know that the model settings used in the transformed, linear model are the same ones used in the logarithmic, un-transformed model:

@indented{@math{logarithmic3(x) = 11.9011 \log_{10}(x) + 59.967}}

@indented{@show{(code '(define (logarithmic3 x) (+ (* 11.9011 (log x)) 59.967)))}}

The resulting logarithmic model can be fit to our original scatter plot, showing a much better fit than our 2-point-derived estimates.

- How do you interpret this model?

@strategy{Optional Activity: Guess the Model!}{

1. Divide students into teams of 2-4, and have each team come up with a logarithmic, real-world scenario, then have them write down a logarithmic function that fits this scenario on a sticky note. Make sure no one else can see the function!
2. On the board or some flip-chart paper, have each team draw a _scatter plot_ for which their logarithmic function is best fit. They should only draw the point cloud - _not the function itself!_ Finally, students title their scatter plot to describe their real-world scenario (e.g. - "Age of a Person from Birth to 16 vs. Number of Cells in their Body").
3. Have teams switch places or rotate, so that each team is in front of another team's scatter plot. Have them figure out the original function, write their best guess on a sticky note, and stick it next to the plot.
4. Have teams return to their original scatter plot, and look at the model their colleagues guessed. How close were they? What strategies did the class use to figure out the model?

- The model settings can be constrained to make the activity easier or harder. For example, limiting these model settings to whole numbers, positive numbers, etc.
- To extend the activity, have the teams continue rotating so that each group adds their sticky note for the best-guess model. Then do a gallery walk so that students can reflect: were the models all pretty close? All over the place? Were the guesses for one coefficient grouped more tightly than the guesses for another?
}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{Why is the @vocab{S-value} for our logarithmic model the same as the @vocab{S-value} for our linear model after transforming?}
@Q{Why were our model settings for linear and logarithmic models the same, even though they were for different terms?}
@Q{Why do you think the relationship between wealth and median lifespan is logarithmic?}
@Q{Suppose all the tech companies in the Bay Area (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.) decided to secede and form their own country with a `pc-gdp` far, far beyond the range of the rest of the data. Would it be appropriate to use our model to predict the `median-lifespan` for their employees? Why or why not?}
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{Is it possible for someone to live to their 6000th birthday?}
@Q{According to our model, is there a `pc-gdp` that would allow someone to live to 6000 years old?}
@A{YES! It's logarithmic so we're talking an unimaginable `pc-gdp`, but a logarithm will keep rising forever.}
@Q{If so, should we throw away the model?}
@A{NO! When building a model from data, a Data Scientist's job is to find the model that _best fits the data_. In this case, the best-fit modal happens to be logarithmic - even if it's biologically impossible!}

== Additional Exercises

For more practice transforming data and programming with filters: 

@indented{
@opt-printable-exercise{transforming-wealth-practice.adoc} is a guided activity that repeats the Data Science and Linearization techniques used here, but with the idea of exploring the relationship of universal healthcare with respect to wealth and median lifespan.
}

@teacher{
We are working on collecting more datasets that can be modeled with logarithmic functions so that we can offer students more practice with using linear regression to build logarithmic models.
