= Transforming the Data
////
* Import Desmos Styles
*
* This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
* which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
*
* It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
* to style all demos glphys
*
* Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
* {points}
* {caret}
* {magnifying}
* {wrench}
*
* Here's an example of using these:
* This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

For this page, you'll need to have *Slide 6: Wealth-v-Health (Transformed)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models (Desmos)* open on your computer.
}

- *Find the `Wealth vs. Health` folder, which is open at the top of the expression list*
- This is the same table we've seen before, and the "points" circle ([.desmosbutton]#{points}#) shows us that these dots are "on" and visible.
- Underneath the `Wealth vs. Health` folder, you'll see a *function* @math{g(x)} and a *list* @math{y_2} defined to be the same as @math{y_1}.
- *Open the second folder, called `Log(Wealth) vs. Health`, by clicking on the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#)*

@n Compare the two tables. (Here is a side by side comparison of how they each begin.)

[cols="1a,1a,3a", options="header", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]

| Wealth vs. Health 
| Log(Wealth) vs. Health 
| Compare the 2 tables. What do you notice? What do you wonder?

@n Read the comments in rows 3 to 6 of the Desmos file. Where do the x-values in the second table come from? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are using the function @math{g(x)} to take the log of the x-values in the first table (`pc-gdp`)}}

@n Why is the second column of both tables the same? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Because 1 * @math{y_1} gives back the same value}}

- *Turn the points for the first table OFF, then turn the points for our new table ON.* +
Our log transformation is so drastic that it looks like all the black datapoints are smashed against the y-axis!
- *Rescale* the graph ([.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}#) to see the cloud. 

@n What is the shape of this point cloud?   @hspace{2em}
@ifsoln-choice{linear}@ifnotsoln{&#9744;} @hspace{2em}
quadratic &#9744;   @hspace{2em} 
exponential &#9744; @hspace{2em}

@n Why do you think transforming the *x-values* make our data look linear? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The amount of extra income needed}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{to create an extra year of predicted lifespan increased exponentially. By taking the log of that income,}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{we are "cancelling out" that exponential growth and making it linear.}}

@n Through trial and error, move the sliders for @math{m} and @math{b} to create the best-fitting linear model you can find, and write it below.

@center{
@math{f(x) = }@fitbruby{10em}{}{slope (m)}@math{x + }@fitbruby{11em}{}{y-intercept / vertical shift}
}

3+^| Let's compare the coefficients from your models.

| *Linear* (From above)
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~12 to ~16}}{slope (m)}
| @fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{~8 to ~25}}{y-intercept / vertical shift}

| *Logarithmic* (From @printable-exercise{logarithmic3-changing-scale/pages/changing-scale.adoc})
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~12 to ~16}}{log coefficient (a)}
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~8 to ~25}}{vertical shift (k)}

@n How are they similar? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{They are similar because we changed the _kind_ of growth from logarithmic to linear, but not the _amount_. }} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Instead of increasing logarithmically by @math{B}, our new function increases _linearly_ by @math{B}}} +
