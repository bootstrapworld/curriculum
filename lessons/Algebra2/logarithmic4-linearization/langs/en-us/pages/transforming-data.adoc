= Transforming the Data
////
* Import Desmos Styles
*
* This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
* which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
*
* It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
* to style all demos glyphs
*
* Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
* {points}
* {caret}
* {magnifying}
* {wrench}
*
* Here's an example of using these:
* This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

@link-instructions{
For this page, you'll need *Slide 7: Wealth-v-Health (Transformed)* of *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models (Desmos)*.
}

@n Compare the two tables below from the Desmos file we are about to work with.

[cols="1a,1a,3a", options="header", frame="none", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| Wealth vs. Health
| Log(Wealth) vs. Health
| What do you Notice or Wonder?

| @image{../images/cropped-wealth-v-health-table.png, 90}
| @image{../images/cropped-log-wealth-v-health-table.png, 100}
| @ifsoln{
- The 2nd columns are the same, but the 1st columns are really different.
- The header for the x-column of the second table is a function that takes in the x&#8321;-value from the first table.
- The first table is the same one we've seen before.
}

== Fitting a Model

@link-instructions{
This slide contains two data tables.

- _The first table is in the @hspace{1em} `Wealth vs. Health`  @hspace{1em}folder and is the same table we've seen before._
- _The second table is in the  @hspace{1em} `Log(Wealth) vs. Health`  @hspace{1em}folder._
  * _The x-values in this table are defined to be the log of the x-values in the first table. (This is defined on line 4.)_
  * _The y-values in this table are the same as the y-values in the first table. (This is defined on line 5.)_
}

@n Notice how the red dots (representing the data points from the original table) are dispersed on the graph.

- Hide these data points from the graph by clicking on the "points" circle ([.desmosbutton]#{points}#) at the top of the y&#8321; column.
- Then click on the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#) in front of the folder name to hide the table.
- Turn ON the points for the @hspace{1em} `Log(Wealth) vs. Health`  @hspace{1em} table by clicking on the "points" circle ([.desmosbutton]#{points}#) at the top of the y&#8322; column

How does the new graph look different from the original graph? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Our log transformation is so drastic that it looks like all the black datapoints are smashed against the y-axis!}}

@n Scroll to the bottom of the @hspace{1em} `Log(Wealth) vs. Health`  @hspace{1em}table and click the [.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}# to rescale the graph.

@n Looking at the point cloud, the best model for this dataset would be (circle one): @hspace{3em} @ifsoln-choice{linear} @hspace{3em} quadratic @hspace{3em} exponential

@n Why do you think transforming the *x-values* makes our data look linear? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The amount of extra income needed to create an extra year of}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{predicted lifespan increased exponentially. By taking the log of that income we are "canceling out" that exponential growth and making it linear.}}

@n Move the sliders for @math{m} and @math{b} at the bottom left to find the best-fitting linear model you can:

[cols="^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|@math{f(x) = }@fitbruby{10em}{}{slope (m)}@math{x + }@fitbruby{11em}{}{y-intercept / vertical shift}
|===

[cols=".>2a,^1a,^1a", options="header", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
3+^| Let's compare the model settings from your linear and logarithmic models.

| *Linear* (From above)
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~12 to ~16}}{slope (m)}
| @fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{~8 to ~25}}{y-intercept / vertical shift}

| *Logarithmic* (From @printable-exercise{logarithmic3-changing-scale/pages/changing-scale-linear-logarithmic.adoc})
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~12 to ~16}}{log coefficient (a)}
| @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~8 to ~25}}{vertical shift (k)}
|===


@n How are they similar? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{The slope and log coefficients are similar... and the vertical shifts are similar. We changed the _kind_ of growth from}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{logarithmic to linear, but not the _amount_.  Instead of increasing logarithmically by @math{a}, our new function increases _linearly_ by the slope.   }}
