For this page, you'll need the @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer. _If you haven't already_, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.
}

@n Add `fun no-universal(r): not(r["has-univ-healthcare"]) end` at the bottom of the Definitions Area. +

@indented{
Read the function definition carefully. What do you think it does? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{looks up the value of the `has-univ-healthcare`}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{column in whatever row it was passed and produces the opposite.}}
}

@n Click "Run" and evaluate @show{(code '(no-universal albania))} in the Interactions Area. What does Pyret return? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`true`}}

@n What does that mean? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Albania does not have univeral healthcare.}}

@n Add `countries-wo-univ = filter(countries-transformed, no-universal)` to the Definitions Area and click "Run".

@indented{
What does evaluating `countries-wo-univ` in the Interactions Area produce? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table of all the countries without universal healthcare}}
}

@n Using the two definitions you just added as models:

@indented{
- *Define a new function* called `yes-universal`, which returns the value in the `has-univ-healthcare` column.
- *Define a new table* called `countries-w-univ`, which shows all the countries with universal healthcare.
- Click "Run" to load these new definitions once you have them both typed into the Definitions Area.
}

@n Fill in the table below by:

@indented{
- Building an `lr-plot` for each of these tables with the transformed-column `log(pc-gdp)`.
- Using what you learn from `lr-plot` to write logarithmic models for each table.
- Using `fit-model` to find @math{S} for each of your logarithmic models and their corresponding un-transformed `countries-w-univ` and `countries-wo-univ` tables.

@n Was the relationship stronger for `countries-w-univ` or `countries-wo-univ`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Countries without universal healthcare}}

@n For which table is `pc-gdp` expected to have a bigger impact on `median-lifespan`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`countries-w-univ`}}

@n Does the strength of the relationship determine how large of an impact `pc-gdp` has on `median-lifespan`? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{No! It determines how well the model predicts the data, not the increase in the variables in relationship to each other}}
