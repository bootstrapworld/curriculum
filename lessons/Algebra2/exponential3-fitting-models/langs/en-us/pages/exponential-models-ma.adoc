[.linkInstructions]
You'll need to have *Slide 4: Exponential Model for MA* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* open on your computer.

@vspace{1ex}

Try changing the value of @math{k}, then @math{a}, then @math{b} to find three promising exponential models, graphing each one and labeling your values on the graphs below. Remember: @vocab{growth rate} (@math{r}) can be calculated from the base: @math{\textit{base} = (1 + \textit{rate})}

== Exponential Model 1

@n What is the initial value (# infections as of June 9th) of this model? @fitb{}{} +
@n What is the @vocab{growth rate} of this model? @fitb{}{} +
@n What is the y-intercept (and horizontal asymptote) of this model? @fitb{}{} +
@n For what range of dates is this model _most_ accurate? @fitb{}{} +
@n For what range of dates is this model _least_ accurate? @fitb{}{} +

== Selecting a Model

@n Choose the model that you think best fits the data, and write it in function notation below:

@center{@math{\text{exponential}(x) = } @fitb{20em}{}}
