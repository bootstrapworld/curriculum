== Benefits and Downsides of working with Approximations

@n What are some possible *benefits* to approximating large and small numbers when doing computations?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Tornadoes can form very quickly, so it's more important to get a warning out *fast*, even if that warning is off by a few minutes or miles.}}

@n What are some possible *downsides* to approximating large and small numbers when doing computations?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A satellite whose launch angle is off by just 0.0001Â° will miss Neptune by 5,000 miles!}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The mass of a neutrino is so small that chopping off the 100th decimal place might mean missing it entirely!}}

== Exponentiation and "RoughNums" in Pyret

@n *Write each of the expressions below in Pyret, then evaluate them and write down the answer.* _The first one has been started for you!_

@n When do you think Pyret switches to RoughNums, instead of Numbers? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Any expression that results in an irrational number}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n In Pyret, evaluate the following expressions: @hspace{2em} @show{(code '(= 1 1))}, @hspace{2em} @show{(code '(= ~1 ~1))} +
_Why do you think Pyret gives an error when comparing identical RoughNums?_

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{RoughNums always represent a _range_ of values on the number line, because two different Numbers might both round to the same RoughNum.}} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{As a result, there is no guarantee that "roughly one" represents the exact same value as "roughly one".

@n The pros of using `~1` involve speed. *What are the potential downsides of using `~1` to speed up a calculation?*

- When calculating a path over an extremely long distance, missing decimal places could result in the Mars Rover missing its destination.
- For an extremely large population like China, rounding to 10 decimal places might result in discounting an entire sub-population!
}

@n How likely are these downsides to apply to our Bootstrap work in @starter-file{editor}?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are not doing any super precise calculations and nobody's life depends on our work, so we're pretty safe.}}
