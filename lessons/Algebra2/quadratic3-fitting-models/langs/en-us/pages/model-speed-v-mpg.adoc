== num-sqr

Before we try to model our fuel-efficiency data, we need to learn a new Pyret function! 

@n Can you predict what the output of the `num-sqr` expressions below will be? +
@hspace{1em} _Test them out in the Interactions Area, and record the results._ @hspace{3em} @show{(code '(sqr 4))} @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{16}} @show{(code '(sqr (- 6 2)))} @fitb{}{@ifsoln{16}}

@n What is the Contract for `num-sqr`? @fitb{}{}

@n What does `num-sqr` do? @fitb{}{}

== Interpreting a Quadratic Model

In the Definitions Area of your @opt-starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency}, you'll find the definition of a quadratic model `quad1`.

@n In `quad1`, the value of @math{a} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{-0.005}}, the value of @math{h} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{10}}, and the value of @math{k} is @fitb{}{@ifsoln{30}}

@n Fit this model to your dataset, using `fit-model`. What @math{S}-value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~9.95787}}

[.indentedpara]
_Hint: If you forgot the contract for `fit-model`, look it up in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Pages}!_

@n In your own words, describe what needs to change about this model to fit the data. @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Sample response: Shift right and up; curve less gradually.}} 

@ifnotsoln{@fitb{}{}}

| *Vertex Form*: @hspace{2em} @math{f(x)=a(x âˆ’ h)^2 + k}

- @math{a}: determines whether the parabola opens up or down and how steep the curve is
- @math{h}: horizontal shift (also the x-coordinate of the vertex! @math{h} is often 0)
- @math{k}: vertical shift (also the y-coordinate of the vertex!)

@n We've determined that peak fuel efficiency is around 45 mph. What variable in the equation should we replace with 45? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{h}}

Update the definition of `quad1`, click "Run" and re-fit the model. What @math{S}-value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~2.154}}

@n What y-coordinate of the vertex (_vertical shift_) would best match the shape of the curve? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~33}} 

[.indentedpara]
Update the definition of `quad1`, click "Run" and re-fit the model. What @math{S}-value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{If k=32, S~1.9166 @hspace{1em} If k=33, S~2.4974}}

@n What value of @math{a} best matches the shape of the curve? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{~ -0.01}} 
[.indentedpara]
Update the definition of `quad1`, click "Run" and re-fit the model. What @math{S}-value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{If k=32, S~1.8505 @hspace{1em} If k=33, S~1.5598}}

@n Make any small changes you'd like, trying to get @math{S} as low as you can. Write your final definition below.

`fun f(x) :` @fitb{30em}{} `end` @hspace{5em} @math{S}: @fitb{}{}

 
== What does this model actually mean?

@teacher{Numerical responses will vary!} 
After experimenting, I came up with a quadratic model for this dataset showing that @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{speed}}{x-variable} is correlated to @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{gas mileage}}{y-variable}. The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{1.6}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{miles per gallon}}{units}. @hspace{1em} I
@fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{agree}}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit considering that @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{miles per gallon}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{23}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{34}}{highest y-value}. The vertex of the parabola drawn by this model is a @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{maxima}}{minima or maxima?} at about @fitbruby{4em}{@ifsoln{(45, 33)}}{(x, y)} which means that @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's most efficient to drive at about 45mph, where cars seem to get about 33mpg.}}

Before this point, as speed increases, `mpg` @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{improves}}. _After_ this point, as speed increases `mpg` @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{declines.}}
