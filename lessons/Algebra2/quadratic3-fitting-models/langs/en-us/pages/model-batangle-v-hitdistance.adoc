== Vertex form of a Quadratic Model

[cols=".^2a, .^4a"]
|===
| *Vertex Form*: @hspace{2em} @math{f(x)=a(x − h)^2 + k}
|
- @math{a}: determines whether the parabola opens up or down and how steep the curve is
- @math{h}: horizontal shift (also the x-coordinate of the vertex! @math{h} is often 0)
- @math{k}: vertical shift (also the y-coordinate of the vertex!)
|===

@n We've determined that the optimum bat angle is around 30 degrees. What variable in the equation should we replace with 30? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{h}}

@n What y-coordinate of the vertex (_vertical shift_) would best match the shape of the curve? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~450}}

@n Does it make sense for @math{a} to be negative or positive for this curve? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{negative}}

== The @show{(code 'sqr)} function

Before we try to build a quadratic model for our data, we need to learn a new Pyret function!

@n Can you predict what the output of the @show{(code 'sqr)} expressions below will be? +
@hspace{1em} _Test them out in the Interactions Area, and record the results._ @hspace{3em} @show{(code '(sqr 4))} @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{16}} @show{(code '(sqr (- 6 2)))} @fitb{}{@ifsoln{16}}

@n What is the Contract for @show{(code 'sqr)}? @fitb{}{ @showsoln{(contract "sqr" '("Number") "Number")}}

@n What does @show{(code 'sqr)} do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{multiply the input times itself}}

== Fitting the Model Visually in Desmos
[.linkInstructions]
For this section, you'll need to have *Exploring Quadratic Functions(Desmos)* open to *Slide 3: Fitting a Model: Bat Angle v Hit Distance (Curveballs)*. +

@n Using your thinking about the values of @math{a}, @math{h}, and @math{k} from above, adjust the sliders to fit a quadratic model to the data.  Continue adjusting the sliders until you've landed on the best model you can. Record your values for @math{a}, @math{h}, and @math{k} below.

@indented{
@math{a}: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{-0.54}} @hspace{2em} @math{h}: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{31}} @hspace{2em} @math{k}: @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{430}}
}

@n Using the values of @math{a}, @math{h}, and @math{k} you decided on in the Desmos file, define your quadratic function below in Pyret notation.

@indented{@show{(code `(define (curve x) (+ (* (?ANS , -0.54) (sqr (- x (?ANS ,31)))) (?ANS ,430))))}}


== Testing how Good the Model is in Pyret
[.linkInstructions]
Open your copy of the @starter-file{alg2-aaron-judge} Adjust the definition for `curve(x)` on line 42 and click "Run".

@n Use `fit-model` to fit `curve(x)` to the `curve-table` data. What @math{S}-value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~71 feet}}

[.indentedpara]
_Hint: If you forgot the contract for `fit-model`, look it up in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Pages}!_

@n The @math{S}-value for the optimal linear model was about 104 feet. +
@indented{My quadratic model should do @fitbruby{25em}{@ifsoln{much better}}{a little better, much better, worse, much worse, an equally good job} at predicting hit distances from bat angles.}
 
== What does this model actually mean?

After experimenting, I came up with a quadratic model for this dataset showing that @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{bat-angle}}{x-variable} is correlated to @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{hit-distance}}{y-variable}.

The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{71}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{feet}}{units}, which is @fitbruby{18em}{@ifsoln{significant}}{insignificant, moderate, significant, extreme}
@indented{considering that @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{hit distances}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{53}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{448}}{highest y-value}.}

The vertex of the parabola drawn by this model is a @fitbruby{9em}{@ifsoln{maxima}}{minima or maxima?} at about @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{(31, 430)}}{(x, y)}, which means that +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the optimal batting angle is about 31 degrees, yielding hits upwards of 430 feet.}}

Before this point, as bat angle increases, hit distance @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{increases}}. After this point, as the angle increases hit distance @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{decreases.}}
