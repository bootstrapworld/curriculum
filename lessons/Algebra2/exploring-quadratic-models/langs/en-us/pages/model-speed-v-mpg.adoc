== Build a Model from Samples

**In this exercise you'll have a chance to build and fit more models to the data, now armed with new tools that let you experiment with squares and square roots.** 

@n The *vertex form* of a quadratic model is shown below. Fill in the vertex using the most-efficient speed from @printable-exercise{pages/exploring-mpg.adoc}:

@center{@math{f(x) = a(x−}@fitbruby{6em}{}{peak efficiency}@math{)^2+k}}

@vspace{1ex}

@center{__But what values of @math{a} and @math{k} will build the best possible model?__}

@n In the Definitions Area of your @starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency}, you'll find a quadratic model `g` defined on line 25. 

In model `g` the value of @math{a} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{1}}, the value of @math{h} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{0}}, and the value of @math{k} is @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{0}}.

@n Fit this model to your dataset, using `fit-model`. What @math{R^2} value did you get? @fitb{}{}

@n Experiment with different values of @math{a}. Which one draws a parabola that __most closely matches__ the shape of the dots above it? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~-1/100}}. 

What @math{R^2} value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~-127.455}}

@n Experiment with different values of @math{k}. Which one draws in a parabola that _most closely fits the shape of the data?_ @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~33}}.

What @math{R^2} value did you get? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{~0.733}}

@star **What does this model actually mean? Try completing the sentence below:**

Model @fitbruby{10em}{f}{sensible name} is a quadratic model, which shows that speed explains @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~73.3}}{R-squared * 100}% of the variability in gas mileage for cars in this dataset. The vertex of the parabola drawn by this model is @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{~45}}{x-value of vertex}, which means that 

@fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{45mph is the most efficient speed to drive}}{interpretation of the vertex}.
