For this page, you'll need to the  @starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Click "Run", and evaluate `mpg-table` in the Interactions Area. Do you know what each column means?

[cols="1a,1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
- *test* - the number of the fuel efficiency test
- *model* - the car used in the test (A-F)
|
- *speed* - the speed at which the car was tested
- *mpg* - the miles-per-gallon the car achieved at that speed
|===

@n Evaluate `A15`, `A45` and `A75` in the Interactions Area. What *model* of car is used in all three rows? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`A`}}

@n At what three *speeds* is this model being tested in these rows? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{15, 45 and 75 miles per gallon}}

@n In Pyret, make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `speed` and `mpg`, using `model` as your labels, then sketch the resulting scatter plot below. Be sure to label your axes!

@n Identify a **model** that is the most fuel-efficient overall? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{B, H, or I}}

@n At what speed does efficiency "peak" (top of curve)? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{45-55mpg}}

|===

@n Does there appear to be a correlation? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Yes}}. If so, describe its form (e.g. - linear, non-linear, or none) and strength (strong, weak, moderate, or none). If it appears to be linear, is the correlation positive, negative, or zero? If it does _not_ appear to be linear, describe its shape.

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{There seems to be a moderate/strong, non-linear correlation}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{It looks like a parabola that opens down, with a dimple at the top}}

@center{**Stop here! We'll continue after some discussion.**}

@n A linear model is defined on line 22, with its Contract on line 21. What is its name? @fitb{2em}{@ifsoln{f}} Domain? @fitb{6em}{@ifsoln{Number}} Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Number}}

@n Use the `fit-model` function (check your contracts page!) to fit the linear model `f` to the data. What is the @math{R^2} value? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-11.794}}.


@n Tweak the slope and y-intercept of `f` to improve the model, and record the resulting model below. 

@center{
 @math{f(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{}{y-intercept} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (f x) (+ (* (?ANS varies) x) (?ANS varies))))}
}

@n What is the @math{R^2}? @fitb{5em}{}  What does it tell us? @fitb{}{}



@n Evaluate @show{(code '(lr-plot mpg-table "model" "speed" "mpg"))} to find the _best-possible_ linear model. What is the @math{R^2}? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{0.00426}}  Write the model below.

@center{
 @math{f(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{@math{-0.01017}}}{slope}x + @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{29.9459}}{y-intercept} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (f x) (+ (* (?ANS -0.01017) x) (?ANS 29.9459))))}
}

@fitb{}{}

@n In your sketch (question 4, above), draw a curve that you think would fit. Do you think the linear or non-linear model you came up with fit better?
