= Exploring Quadratic Models

@description{Students investigate quadratic relationships in data about Fuel Efficiency, using an inquiry-based model of sense-making, hypothesizing, modeling and testing. They are introduced to table transformations and inverse functions, which are used to fit linear models onto nonlinear data.}

== Looking for Patterns @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1RESEiKCepBRV3_AbthDydHaq5b9BN2zy, Fuel Efficiency Starter File}, and create scatter plots to search for relationships between columns. They share and discuss their findings with the class, discovering the limitations of linear models.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open the @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1RESEiKCepBRV3_AbthDydHaq5b9BN2zy, Fuel Efficiency Starter File}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete questions 1-8 of @printable-exercise{exploring-mpg.adoc}.

Review student answers to confirm that students see a _non-linear_ relationship in the dataset with a relatively strong correlation.

=== Investigate

There's definitely a relationship here. Even though some cars are more efficient than others, fuel efficiency generally increases from 15 to roughly 55mph. But after 55mph, fuel efficiency _decreases._

[.lesson-instruction]
- Let's try to build a linear model for this data!
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete the rest of of @printable-exercise{exploring-mpg.adoc}.

By now you've tried to fit quite a few linear models to this data, and we're not getting anywhere!

[cols="^.^1a,^.^1a,^.^1a", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| We can build linear models that fit the "increasing" half of the data...
| We can build linear models that fit the "decreasing" half of the data...
| We can build linear models that try to split the difference...

...but all of them are so far away from so many points, and our @math{R^2} is pretty bad.

=== Synthesize

- Why aren't linear models working for us?
- What else could we try?

== Fitting Quadratic Models @duration{35 minutes}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to quadratic models, and extend the sampling techniques from the linear models lesson into quadratic relationships.

=== Launch

Linear models are great for fitting simple relationships. But the real world isn't so simple, and more often than not linear models are just too primitive to handle that complexity.

Relationships that rise and fall are called @vocab{quadratic relationships}. They form shapes that look like arches, called parabolas. Sometimes the data only includes the _rising_ part of the parabola, and sometimes it only includes the _falling_ part. And of course, sometimes it includes both!

Quadratic relationships show up all the time!

- When an athlete is young, they steadily improve as they get stronger and more skilled. But as they age, they lose some of their speed and strength.
- A ball dropped from a tall building will steadily get faster and faster as it falls.
- Many nutrients are good for you, and the more you take the healthier you are...up to a point. After that, too much of a mineral or vitamin can cause problems.

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you think of other real-world examples where a relationship is likely quadratic?

You should already be familiar with the different forms of linear models:

[cols="^1,^1,^1", options="header"]
|===
| Standard 			| Point-slope				| Slope-intercept
| @math{Ax+By = C}	| @math{y_1-y = m(x_1-x)}	| @math{y = mx+b}
|===

Depending on what part of the model we care about most, we might choose to use one display over another.

The same is true for quadratic models:

[cols="^1,^1,^1", options="header"]
|===
| Standard Form 		| Vertex Form			| Factored Form
| @math{y=ax^2+bx+c}	| @math{y=a(x−h)^2+k}	| @math{y=a(x−r_1)(x−r_2)}
|===

In this case, we've already come to some conclusions about the @vocab{vertex} of our parabola, where cars are most fuel-efficient: *45mph*. That makes Vertex Form a useful place to start, since we already know the value of coefficient @math{H}. Now we need to figure out the values of @math{a} and @math{k}.

@math{y=a(x-45)^2+k}

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{model-speed-v-mpg.adoc}
- As you experiment with different quadratic models, graph them on @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}, being sure to label their intercepts, and maxima or minima!

=== Synthesize

* What was the highest @math{R^2} you were able to get?
** Responses will vary
* What model was that?
** Responses will vary
* Could a quadratic model be used to fit a linear relationship?
** YES! If the coefficient of the quadratic term is zero, it's equivalent to a linear model.
