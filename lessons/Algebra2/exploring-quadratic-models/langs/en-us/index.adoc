@description{Students investigate quadratic relationships in data about Fuel Efficiency, using an inquiry-based model of sense-making, hypothesizing, modeling and testing. They are introduced to table transformations and inverse functions, which are used to fit quadratic models onto nonlinear data.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* Read and interpret real-world data, presented in a scatter plot
* Model quadratic relationships using functions

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Let's use Pyret to model quadratic relationships in data


| Materials
|[.materials-links]
@material-links

| Preparation
|
* All students should pull up their @online-exercise{program-list} and, open the @starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency}.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Unlike linear functions, which are governed by slope and y-intercept, quadratic functions are governed by the bevahior of _three_ factors.
* Students should gain an intuition for these factors by playing with them first in Desmos, then use them to fit a model in Pyret.

== Looking for Patterns @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the @starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency}, and create scatter plots to search for relationships between columns. They share and discuss their findings with the class, discovering the limitations of linear models.

=== Launch

When you're driving, what speed will save you the most money on gas?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-fuel-efficiency}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete questions 1-10 of @printable-exercise{pages/exploring-mpg.adoc}.

@teacher{Review student answers to confirm that students see a _non-linear_ relationship in the dataset with a relatively strong correlation. **Make sure students have agreed on a "most efficient speed"**, as the location of the vertex is important for the next activity!}

=== Investigate

@center{@image{images/fuel-efficiency-quadratic.png}}

There's definitely a relationship here. Even though some cars are more efficient than others, fuel efficiency generally increases from 15 to around 45-55mph. But after 55mph, fuel efficiency _decreases._

[.lesson-instruction]
- Let's try to build a linear model for this data.
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete the rest of of @printable-exercise{pages/exploring-mpg.adoc}.

By now we've tried to fit quite a few linear models to this data, and we're not getting anywhere.

| We can build linear models that fit the increasing half of the data...
| We can build linear models that fit the decreasing half of the data...
| We can build linear models that try to split the difference...

...but all of them are so far away from so many points, and our @math{R^2} is pretty bad.

=== Synthesize

- Why didn't linear models work for us?
- What kinds of curves did you draw to fit better?
- Can you think of functions that look like those curves?

== Quadratic Relationships @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to quadratic relationships in the real world, then learn about them in abstract, mathematical terms. They develop vocabulary for describing parts of a parabola.

=== Launch

Linear models are great for fitting simple relationships. But the real world isn't so simple, and, more often than not, linear models are just too primitive to handle that complexity.

Relationships like the one in the fuel efficiency scatter plot are called _quadratic relationships_. They form shapes that look like arches, called parabolas. Sometimes the data only includes the _rising_ part of the parabola, sometimes it only includes the _falling_ part, and sometimes it includes both.

**Quadratic relationships show up all the time:**

- When an athlete is young, they improve as they get stronger and more skilled. But as they age, they begin to lose their speed and strength.
- A ball dropped from a tall building will get faster and faster as it falls.
- Many nutrients are good for you, and the more you take the healthier you are...up to a point. After that, too much of a mineral or vitamin can cause problems.

@span{.title}{Going Deeper: Interaction Effects}

We often think about variables of a model being _independent_ from one another, each contributing a little to the outcome we are measuring. But sometimes one input will amplify the result of another input, meaning their combined contribution is greater than the sum of their separate contributions.

A quadratic relationship often means that one or more variables is _interacting_ with another variable. In our miles-per-gallon example, it turns out that a linear increase in speed has a _more than linear effect_ on mpg!
|===

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you think of other real-world examples where a relationship is likely quadratic?

=== Investigate

You already know that linear relationships can be described with terms like "slope" and "y-intercept". Parabolas have their own terms, as well.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Do all parabolas have y-intercepts?
- Do parabolas have _slope?_
- If "slope" and "y-intercept" are critical parts of a linear relationship, what do you think the important parts of a quadratic relationship might be?

|
- @vocab{vertex} - In a quadratic relationship, the vertex is the point at which a parabola "changes direction", and goes from climbing to sinking (or vice versa).
- @vocab{maxima} - The highest point in a parabola that "opens down"
- @vocab{minima} - The lowest point in a parabola that "opens up"
| @image{images/opens.png, 175}

|
- @vocab{y-intercept} - Like linear models, parabolas always cross the y-axis once when x=0.
|  @image{images/y-intercept.png, 175}

|
- @vocab{x-intercepts} / @vocab{roots} - All linear functions cross the x-axis once, when y=0. These are sometimes called "roots", or "zeros" of the function. A quadratic function can cross the x-axis once, twice, or even __no times at all!__

=== Synthesize

- How are quadratic models _similar_ to linear ones?
- How are they _different?_

== Fitting Quadratic Models @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to quadratic models, and extend the model-fitting techniques from the @lesson-link{exploring-linear-models} lesson into quadratic relationships.

=== Launch

You should already be familiar with the different forms of linear models:

[cols="^1,^1,^1", options="header"]
|===
| Slope-intercept		| Point-slope				| Standard 	
| @math{y = mx+b}		| @math{y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)}	| @math{Ax+By = C}
|===

Depending on what part of the model we care about most, we might choose to use one display over another.

The same is true for quadratic models:

[cols="^1,^1,^1", options="header"]
|===
| Standard Form 		| Vertex Form			| Factored Form
| @math{y=ax^2+bx+c}	| @math{y=a(x−h)^2+k}	| @math{y=a(x−r_1)(x−r_2)}
|===

Depending on what part of the model we care about most, we might choose to use one display over another.

- Standard Form makes it easy to find the @vocab{y-intercept} of the parabola @math{c}
- Vertex Form makes it easy to find the @vocab{vertex} (@vocab{minima} or @vocab{maxima}) of the parabola
- Factored Form makes it easy to find the @vocab{roots} of the parabola

[.lesson-instruction]
Given what we've already found out about this dataset, which form should we start with?

In this case, we've already come to some conclusions about the @vocab{vertex} of our parabola, where cars are most fuel-efficient: *45mph*. That makes Vertex Form a useful place to start, since we already know the value of @math{H}:

@center{@math{y=a(x-45)^2+k}}

Now we need to figure out the values of @math{a} and @math{k}.

=== Investigate

But what do each of the coefficients in Vertex Form mean?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open @starter-file{alg2-exploring-quadratics} in Desmos.
- Use Desmos to complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}.

Now that we have a sense for what these coefficients mean, let's try to model the speed-v-mpg relationship using a quadratic model.

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{model-speed-v-mpg.adoc}


=== Synthesize

You've had a chance to experiment with quadratic models in vertex form:

@center{@math{y=a(x−h)^2+k}}

* How do you translate a parabola left and right?
** Change the value of @math{h}
* How do you translate a parabola up and down?
** Change the value of @math{k}
* How do you make a parabola "narrower" or "wider"?
** Change the value of @math{a}

* What was the highest @math{R^2} you were able to get? What model was it?
** Responses will vary
* Could a quadratic model be used to fit a linear relationship?
** YES! If the coefficient of the quadratic term is zero, it's equivalent to a linear model.
