== Other Forms of Quadratic Models

=== Overview

Students learn that there are multiple forms for defining quadratic relationships and consider which form works best depending on the information available from a scatter plot.

=== Launch

You already know that there are different forms of linear models, and that we might choose to use one display over another, depending on what information we have available to us or are most interested in. There are also different forms of quadratic models!

When we looked at the scatter plot for the fuel efficiency data, it was easy for us to see the vertex just by drawing the curve and finding the highest point. To model this data, we started with a particular form that put the @vocab{vertex} front-and-center.

But not all scatterplots will most clearly reveal the vertex, so this form won't always be the right choice! Fortunately, there are several forms of quadratic models:

| Standard Form 		| Vertex Form				| Factored Form
| @math{f(x)=ax^2+bx+c}	| @math{f(x)=a(x−h)^2+k}	| @math{f(x)=a(x−r_1)(x−r_2)}
<| 
- @math{a}: the direction (opens "up" or "down") and steepness of the curve
- @math{c}: y-intercept
<|
- @math{a}: the direction (opens "up" or "down") and steepness of the curve
- @math{h}: x-coordinate of the vertex
- @math{k}: y-coordinate of the vertex

- @math{a}: the direction (opens "up" or "down") and steepness of the curve
- @math{r_1} and @math{r_2}: x-intercepts, aka "roots"

And, depending on what part of the model we care about most, we might choose to use one display over another:

- **Standard Form** makes it easy to find the @vocab{y-intercept} of the parabola
- **Vertex Form** makes it easy to find the @vocab{vertex} (@vocab{minima} or @vocab{maxima}) and @vocab{axis of symmetry} of the parabola
- **Factored Form** makes it easy to find the @vocab{roots} of the parabola
