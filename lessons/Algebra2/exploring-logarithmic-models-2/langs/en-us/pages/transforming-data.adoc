= Transforming the Data
////
* Import Desmos Styles
*
* This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
* which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
*
* It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
* to style all demos glphys
*
* Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
* {points}
* {caret}
* {magnifying}
* {wrench}
*
* Here's an example of using these:
* This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

For this page, you'll need to load  @online-exercise{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tebdsmpibm, Wealth-v-Health - Transformed} open on your computer.

== Transforming the Data

**Open the `Wealth vs. Health` folder by clicking on the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#)**

@n This is the same table we've seen before. Notice that the "points" circle ([.desmosbutton]#{points}#) is empty. What does this mean? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{These dots are not being displayed.}}

@vspace{1ex}

**Underneath the `Wealth vs. Health` folder, you'll see a function @math{g(x)} and a list @math{y_2} defined.**

@vspace{1ex}

**Open the `Data Table` folder by clicking on the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#)**

@n Compare the two tables. What do you *Notice*? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n What do you *Wonder*? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Our new @math{y_2} is identical to @math{y_1}, so the second column (`median-lifespan`) is unchanged. But what is happening in the first column? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{We are using the function @math{g(x)} to take the ln of `pc-gdp`}}

@vspace{1ex}

Notice that the "points" ([.desmosbutton]#{points}#) circle is filled, displaying the points from this new table on the graph. If necessary, click the magnifying glass ([.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}#) to resize the graph.

@n What is the shape of the new point cloud? Is it linear? Quadratic? Exponential? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's linear!}}

@n Move the sliders for @math{m} and @math{b} to create the best-fitting linear model you can find, and write it below.

[cols="^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
@math{f(x) = }@fitbruby{10em}{}{slope (m)}@math{x + }@fitbruby{10em}{}{y-intercept / vertical shift (b)}
|===

@n Why did transforming the *x-values* make our data look linear? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

== Transforming Axes vs. Transforming Data

@n From your linear model above, copy your values for slope (@math{m}) and vertical shift (@math{c}):

[cols="^1a,^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| @fitbruby{15em}{}{slope (m)}
| @fitbruby{15em}{}{vertical shift (c)}
|===

@n From the bottom of @printable-exercise{exploring-logarithmic-models/pages/transforming-axis.adoc}, copy your values for growth factor and vertical shift:

[cols="^1a,^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| @fitbruby{15em}{}{growth factor (b)}
| @fitbruby{15em}{}{vertical shift (c)}
|===

@n Are they similar? @fitb{5em}{} Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}
