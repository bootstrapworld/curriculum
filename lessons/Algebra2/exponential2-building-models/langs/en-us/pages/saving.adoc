@n Suppose a family opened a savings accounts when their child was born and let the interest accrue until the kid graduated from high school...
Which would you expect to make a bigger difference in the account balance 18 years later?  +
@center{&#9744; Doubling the initial amount @hspace{5em} &#9744;Doubling the interest rate @hspace{5em}@ifnotsoln{&#9744;} @ifsoln-choice{It depends}}

@n Let's test our hypothesis by completing the table below.

[cols="1a,1a,1a,1a,1a,1a"]

| Initial Deposit 	| Interest Rate  	| Function 							 	| Value after 18 years  | Amount Change    	| Percent Change
| 100				| 4					| @ifsoln{@math{f(x) = 100(1.04)^x}}  	| @ifsoln{~$202.58}	 	| @ifsoln{~$102.58}	| @ifsoln{~102.58%}

@n What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{*I notice:* The percent change for an interest rate doesn't change when initial amount changes.}}

@blanklines{1}{@ifsoln{ *I wonder:* What would happen if we'd waited half as long or twice as long? used different initial deposits? different interest rates?}}	

@n Which had the greater impact, increasing the initial deposit from $100 to $200 or doubling the interest rate from 4% to 8%? @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{2}{@ifsoln{Starting with twice as much money led to ending $6 ahead. But the account with the bigger interest rate ended up with almost as much money, meaning it grew by an additional $94.44 and experienced a much higher percent change!}}

@n Would you expect outcomes to be similar with 6% and 12% interest rates? @fitb{10em}{} Complete the table below to check.

@n What do you Notice? What do you Wonder? @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{2}{*I notice:* With bigger interest rates, doubling the interest rate made a much bigger difference! No matter what the initial deposit, the percent change is still the same if the interest rate is the same. *I wonder:* What would happen if we'd waited half as long or twice as long?}	

@n Which had the greater impact, increasing the initial deposit from $100 to $200 or doubling the interest rate from 6% to 12%? @fitb{}{}

@blanklines{2}{@ifsoln{The bigger interest rate! It ended up almost $200 ahead of starting with twice as much money, earned nearly twice as much money, and the percent change was almost 3x as big!}}

@n As more time passes, I'd expect the difference between higher and lower interest rates @fitbruby{}{@ifsoln{is more dramatic}}{stays the same, is less dramatic, is more dramatic}.
