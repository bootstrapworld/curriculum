= What Kind of Model? (Descriptions)

Decide whether each situation is best described by a linear, quadratic, or exponential function. +
*If the function is exponential:* What is the growth factor. Is it doubling (factor of 2)? Tripling (factor of 3)? Factor of 5? 10?

== Car Values
*A particular kind of car sells for $32,000, and its resale value drops by 12.5% each year.*

@n Is the function increasing or decreasing? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{Increasing}}

@n When the car is brand-new (x=0), how much is it worth? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$32,000}}

@n How much is it worth after...

Fill in the coefficients to write a function that shows the value of the car after a given number of years:

== Lemonade Stand
*Sally is selling lemonade, for $1.25 a glass in hopes of finally be able to get the power drill she's been wanting. She starts with $20 cash.*
