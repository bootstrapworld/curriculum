An AI was asked to fit an exponential model to each of the scatter plots below. Did the AI do a good job? (_HINT: try drawing the curve-of-best-fit for these plots!_)

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong, and why?

@blanklines{5}{
The value at @math{x=0} is definitely 25, but the AI arrived at that answer via a vertical shift rather than using the initial value @math{a}. And while that might work for @math{x=0}, the growth of the function is much too slow for @math{a=1}. It's more likely @math{f(x) = 25 \times 2^x + 25}

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
The AI got the initial value right, with @math{a=25}. But the horizontal shift is backwards! Instead of being shifted right by 100, the AI added @math{h} instead of subtracting it.

@center{*AI's Suggested Model: @math{f(x) = 1.6^x - 5000}*}

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
The value at @math{x=0} is definitely close to @math{-5000}, so the vertical shift @math{k} looks right. But the AI thought this was exponential _growth_, when it's definitely _decay_.
}

@center{*AI's Suggested Model: @math{f(x) = 5000 \times 2^x}*}

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
The value at @math{x=0} _is_ 5000, which could have come from the initial value @math{a}, as the AI thought. But it could also have come from the vertical shift! And with an @math{a} of 5000, we would expect insanely fast growth instead of the leisurely growth seen in this graph. It's more likely @math{f(x) = 2^x + 5000}
