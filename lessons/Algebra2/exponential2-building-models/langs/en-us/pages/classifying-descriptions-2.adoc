Decide whether each situation is best described by a linear, {nbsp}quadratic, or exponential function. +
@hspace{1em} *If the function is exponential:* Identify the growth factor and the initial value.

== High Fives
*Two students started a club. At every meeting, students in attendance must high-five each of the other students. Club membership has been growing steadily by one student each meeting.*

@n Is the function increasing or decreasing? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{Increasing}}

@n When the 2 students started the club (x=0), how many high-fives happened? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n How many high-fives happen at the subsequent meetings...

@n *If it's exponential*,

@indented{
Fill in the blanks to write a function that shows the how many high-fives happen for a given number of students:

@math{f(x) = } @fitbruby{8em}{}{initial value @math{a}} @math{\times} @fitbruby{8em}{}{growth factor @math{b}} ^x^ @hspace{2em} + @hspace{2em} @fitbruby{8em}{}{horizontal asymptote @math{k}}

== Going Viral
*A student posted a video of a dog doing a back flip into a pile of laundry. The meme went totally viral, and the number of shares increased 10x every day!*

@n Is the function increasing or decreasing? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{Increasing}}

@n How many _total_ shares did the video have on the first day (x=0), when the student posted it? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{1}}

@star How many _total_ shares happened each day after that...
