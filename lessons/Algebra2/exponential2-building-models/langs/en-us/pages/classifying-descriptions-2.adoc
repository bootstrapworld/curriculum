= What Kind of Model? (Descriptions 2)

Decide whether each situation is best described by a linear, quadratic, or exponential function. +
*If the function is exponential:* What is the growth factor. Is it doubling (factor of 2)? Tripling (factor of 3)? Factor of 5? 10?

== High Fives
*Two students started a club. At every meeting, students in attendance must high-five each of the other students. Club membership has been growing steadily by one student each meeting.*

@n Is the function increasing or decreasing? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{Increasing}}

@n When the 2 students started the club (x=0), how many high-fives happened? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n How many high-fives happen at the subsequent meetings...

@n *If it's exponential*,

@indented{
Fill in the coefficients to write a function that shows the how many high-fives happen for a given number of students:

@math{f(x) = } @fitbruby{8em}{}{initial value @math{a}} @math{\times} @fitbruby{8em}{}{growth factor @math{b}} ^x^ @hspace{2em} + @hspace{2em} @fitbruby{8em}{}{horizontal asymptote @math{k}}

== Going Viral
*A student posted their animation of a puppy doing a back flip into a pile of laundry and the meme went viral! Every person that sees the meme falls in love with it and shares it with 10 new friends.*

@n Is the function increasing or decreasing? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{Increasing}}

@n When the student posts it (x=0), how many total times has it been shared? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{1}}

@n How many times will it have been shared after...
