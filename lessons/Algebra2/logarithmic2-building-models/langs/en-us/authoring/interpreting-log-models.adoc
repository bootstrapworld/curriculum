For this page, you'll need the @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

*We started with a model based on Afghanistan and Albania. We can interpret the slope and @math{S} value below:*

_The @fitbruby{20em}{Afghanistan-Albania}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{dollar}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{5.169}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. Based on the @math{S} of @fitbruby{10em}{TODO}{S value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{really, really poorly}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}._

@n Describe the optimal model YOU created via linear regression:

_The @fitbruby{20em}{linear-regression}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{percent}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{percent college degrees}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{1142 dollar}}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. With an @math{S} of @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{.585}}{S value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{pretty well}}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}._

@n Does each additional dollar of per-capita gdp in thousands provide an equal boost in lifespan? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. Log functions grow by smaller and smaller amount as x increases}}
