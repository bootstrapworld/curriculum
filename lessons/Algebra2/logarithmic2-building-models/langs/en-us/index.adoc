@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. + 
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first two slides. _(As the lesson progresses you will be directed to adjust the pacing or sync students to you so that they have access to relevant slides.)_
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- This lesson assumes that students have been introduced to logarithms before, and are familiar with computation involving logarithmic functions.
- The focus of this lesson is about _applications_ of log functions, and builds an intuition for logarithmic computation by motivating substantial trial and error.

== Logarithmic Functions

=== Overview
Having identified that the wealth-v-lifespan scatter plot is neither linear, nor quadratic, nor exponential, students learn about characteristics of logarithmic functions in graphical, tabular, and function notation form.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- Open @starter-file{alg2-countries}, and make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `pc-gdp` and `median-lifespan`, using the name of the `country` as the label.
}

All of the models we just found for our dataset made predictions with too much error. Even though this shape looks _familiar_, it's just not any kind of growth we've seen before.

Exponential growth started really _slowly_, and then suddenly shot up like a rocket to numbers so large we can't even reason about them. This kind of growth feels like the exact opposite, growing really _quickly_ but then leveling off to something very slow.

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/covid-graph.png, 375}}Let's think back to the graph of our model for Covid spread, from @lesson-link{exponential1-exploring-covid}.

- Our model answers the question "how many positive cases do we predict after @math{x} days?"
- The graph is showing us the relationship from +
_days → cases_, _x → y_, or _Domain → Range_.

But what if we want to answer the _opposite_ question: "how many days will it take to reach @math{y} cases?"

- Now we want to *flip the relationship around*, asking for +
_cases → days_, _y → x_, or _Range → Domain_.
- What would *this* graph look like?

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/covid-graph.png, 350}}}

Swapping the x's and y's is like reflecting the graph across the diagonal, making the axes trade places and swapping the x- and y-values for point on the line. Let's do that with our Covid model...

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/inverse-covid-graph.png, 350}}Swapping the x- and y-axes makes the graph _start_ with rapid growth, and then flatten out. Now we can answer those inverted questions!

- During the pandemic, our initial value was roughly 120,000 cases.
- By 150,000 cases, it was 75 days later.
- By 300,000 cases, it was 112 days later.
- By 400,000 cases, it was 122 days after.

@clear

This kind of growth is much easier to understand, and *much more alarming!* By switching the axes, we've given our brains a much better chance of understanding what was really happening.

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/inverse-covid-graph.png, 375}}}But our inverted model isn't exponential at all. In fact, it looks a lot more like our Wealth-v-Lifespan data!

==== What kind of growth _is_ this?

@slidebreak

This kind of growth is called _logarithmic growth_. Logarithmic functions are closely related to exponential functions!

[cols="^1a, ^1a", stripes="none" options="header"]
|===
| Exponential
| Logarithmic

| @math{f(x) = 3^x}
| @math{g(x) = log_3(x)}

| Tells us "what 3 to the power of 'the input' is"
| Tells us "what power 3 needs to be raised to reach 'the input'"

| @math{f(2) = 3^2 = 9}
| @math{g(9) = log_3(9) = 2}
|===

@QandA{
@Q{What will @math{f(4)} evaluate to?}
@A{@math{f(4) = 3^3 = 27}}
@Q{What will @math{g(27)} evaluate to?}
@A{@math{g(27) = log_3(27) = 3}}
}

@slidebreak

*"A logarithmic relationship looks exponential, if your @math{x}'s and @math{y}'s trade places!"*

By "reversing the question", logarithmic functions and exponential functions serve as inverses of one another:

- The inputs and outputs are reversed
- The Domain and Range are swapped
- The curve is reflected over @math{y=x}

@lesson-instruction{
To practice spotting logarithmic curves and their connection to exponentials, complete @printable-exercise{classifying-plots.adoc}.

| Exponential Function
| Logarithmic Function


| We know that exponential functions grow by _equal factors over the same interval_. We can describe their growth by calculating the @vocab{growth factor}: "what @math{y} is multiplied by" in order to produce the next value over a constant interval.
| Instead of multiplying @math{y} by a constant to find the next value, we need to _multiply the size of our x-interval_ by a constant (called the @vocab{base}) in order to get a constant growth in @math{y}!

@slidebreak

@ifslide{*"A logarithmic relationship looks exponential, if your @math{x}'s and @math{y}'s trade places!"*}

Just as swapping the Domain and Range makes a logarithmic _curve_ look exponential, swapping the (x,y) columns of a table makes a logarithmic _sequence_ look exponential.

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-tables.adoc} and decide whether you think each table is best modeled by a quadratic, exponential or logarithmic function.
- If the table shows an exponential *or* logarithmic relationship, identify the base.
}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
- What strategies did you use to decide if a table represented a quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic function?
- Was it especially difficult (or simple) to recognize any these function types? Why?
}

@lesson-instruction{
- For practice translating logarithmic expressions into words and evaluating them turn to @printable-exercise{evaluate-log.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
The "Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions" page uses a phrasing that helps students read a logarithmic expression from left-to-right, emphasizing readability. Many teachers prefer a different phrasing, which emphasizes _the connection to exponential expressions_. An @opt-printable-exercise{evaluate-log-alt.adoc, identical version of this worksheet} is available, which uses the exponential phrasing.

  * A fire alarm is _thousands of times louder_ than a dog barking, but our brains don't process that difference.
  * When we hear a sound that is _ten times as loud_ as another, our brains perceive it to only be _twice_ as loud.
  * _Exponentially increasing sound-strength_ is perceived as _constantly increasing loudness_, so *our perception of sound increases logarithmically with respect to sound strength.*

Students can check out @link{images/xkcd.png, this wonderful visualization} from @link{https://www.xkcd.com, XKCD}, which uses a logarithmic scale to draw the entire known universe. The constantly-increasing vertical distance in the picture represents an _exponentially-increasing_ distance, which is why the Eiffel Tower and Great Pyramid at the bottom appear "stretched out" at the bottom and "compressed" at the top!

- We don't *taste* spiciness as it really is. We taste a logarithmically compressed version of it!

  * The @link{https://ScovilleScale.org/chili-pepper-scoville-scale/, Scoville Scale} measures how spicy we perceive a pepper to be, based on the amount of capsaicin in the pepper.
  * Each unit on the scale means there is an _exponentially greater amount of capsaicin_, so a pepper that measures a 4.0 actually contains _ten times the capsaicin_ of a 3.0.
  * In other words, an _exponentially-increasing amount of capsaicin_ is perceived as a _constantly increasing spiciness_, so *our perception of spiciness increases logarithmically with respect to how much capsaicin there is.*



=== Investigate

Logarithmic Functions can be written in the form: @math{f(x) = a \log_b(x-h) + k}

Most textbooks only present logarithmic functions with a horizontal shift of zero. When h=0, we can safely remove it and use this simplified form of the equation:

@center{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + k}}

@teacher{
@opt{Advance your teacher dashboard of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos} to *Slide 3: How does h transform logarithmic functions?* and give your students a chance to reinforce their understanding of @math{h-values} from other models by connecting it to logarithmic functions.
}}

==== Logarithmic models have the form @math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + k}

@teacher{Sync or pace students to *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}. 

Decide whether you want to debrief this activity with your students after they complete each section or wait until they have finished completing @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Desmos* file and explore how the constants in a logarithmic function definition impact the shape of its graph. 
- You should now be on *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* 
- Use it to complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}
}

@teacher{Review students answers, and then debrief via class discussion. Invite students to consider what new information they have gained by looking at graphical representations rather than tables.}

@slidebreak

==== Base @math{b}

The base of the logarithm is similar to the base (or @vocab{growth factor}) in an exponential expression...it just answers the opposite question!

[cols="^1a,^1a", stripes="none", options="header"]
|===
| Exponential Expression
| Logarithmic Expression

|@math{3^2} 
|@math{\log_3(9)} 

| "calculate 3 to the power of 2"
| "calculate what power 3 is raised to in order to reach 9"

| Evaluates to 9
| Evaluates to 2
|===

@slidebreak

@QandA{
The expression @math{log_2(1)} is asking "to what power must 2 be raised to reach 1?
@Q{What power of 2 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What question is @math{log_5(1)} asking?}
@A{"To what power must 5 be raised, to reach 1?"}
@Q{What power of 5 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What can we conclude about logs that evaluate to 1?}
@A{They will always be zero, regardless of base!}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{No matter the base, @math{log(1)} will always be zero!}

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-descriptions.adoc} and practice identifying whether the scenarios are best modeled by linear quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic functions.
- What clues did you use to help you identify which relationships were which?
}

@teacher{Have students share their answers. Be especially attentive to students who mis-label logarithmic relationships as "exponential" -- the relationship between the two is extremely subtle!}

@slidebreak

Most math books, Desmos, calculators, and programming languages offer a simple "log" function that doesn't specify a base. By convention, if the base isn't specified, _it's assumed to be base-10_. Pyret's `log` function works the same way:

@center{`log(1000) # returns 3, because 10^3 = 1000`}

If you want to work with a different base, you can look up Pyret's `log-base` function in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, contracts pages}.

@slidebreak

==== Vertical Shift @math{k}

The term @math{k} is the vertical shift of the function, which moves the curve up or down.

Since @math{log_{anything}(1) = 0}, the value of a standard log model at @math{x=1} will always be @math{0 + k}.

(_We've seen vertical shifts in other kinds of functions given different names, like @math{b} for linear functions._)

@slidebreak

==== Logarithmic Coefficient @math{a}

The term @math{a} is called the logarithmic coefficient, which - like @math{b} - helps determine how quickly the function grows.

@QandA{
@Q{What do you remember about the asymptote of a function with exponential growth?}
@A{It's horizontal at @math{k}, where @math{y} grows or shrinks by smaller and smaller amounts approaching zero}
}

Functions with logarithmic growth have a *vertical asymptote* where the function gets closer and closer, but never crosses the line.

@teacher{In this data exploration, the @vocab{asymptote} will always be located on the y-axis (@math{x = 0}).

Extremely observant students may notice that there's a relationship between @math{a} and @math{b}, where the value of @math{2 \log_{10}(10) = \log_{10}(10^2)}!}


=== Synthesize
- What _similarities_ do you see between exponential and logarithmic functions?
- What _differences_ do you see between exponential and logarithmic functions?
