| Preparation
| 
@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on the same custom-built interactive Desmos activity we introduced in @lesson-link{logarithmic1-exploring-wealth-health}.
 * Set the pacing so that students are synced to you and only able to interact with the slide for the lesson section you are working on.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * If you don't already have a code, or you want to share a new one, you will first want to:
 *** Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 *** Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}
- Decide whether or not you want to teach the optional portion of this lesson on Computations with Exponents and Logarithms. The pages linked in that section are not included in the workbook. 
- If you are using our Google Slides, you will see the word "Optional" in the title of any slide that corresponds to an optional section of the lesson plan. Adjust the slides based on which portions of the lesson you will be doing with your students.  
}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- This lesson assumes that students have been introduced to logarithms before, and are familiar with computation involving logarithmic functions.
- The focus of this lesson is about _applications_ of log functions, and builds an intuition for logarithmic computation by motivating substantial trial and error.

== From Exponents to Logarithms
@objective{logarithms-exponents}

=== Overview
Students are asked to consider the graphs of logarithmic functions as the reflection of an exponential function across the diagonal line @math{y=x}.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch-DN}

@teacher{Heads up: This launch refers back to data from @lesson-link{exponential1-exploring-covid}.}

The linear, quadratic and exponential models we’ve found for the @starter-file{alg2-countries} all made predictions with too much error to be useful. But what other kinds of models are there?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{swapping-axes-n-w.adoc}.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
}

@slidebreak{Launch}

*The kind of growth we're seeing in the Countries dataset looks a lot like the Covid graph with the axes swapped!*

When we reflect the covid curve over @math{y=x}, the graph _starts_ with rapid growth, and then flattens out.

@ifnotslide{@center{@image{images/crossfade.png, 350}}}

@slidebreak{Launch}

*When we swap the axes, the model answers the opposite question!*

@slidebreak{LaunchR}

@ifslide{@image{images/MA-covid-flipped.png}}
We see that:

- We had ~104,000 cases in our initial value ("day 0").
- To reach 116,000 cases, it took 50 days.
- To reach 126,000 cases, it took 100 days.
- To reach 167,000 cases, it took 150 days.
- To reach 350,000 cases, it took 200 days.

And we are much better able to understand just how quickly the infections were spreading.

@slidebreak{Launch}

When an exponential relationship is "inverted" like this, the new shape is called a @vocab{logarithmic relationship}.

@vocab{Logarithmic functions} and @vocab{exponential functions} serve as inverses of one another.

@indented{
- The Domain and Range are swapped.
- The axes are swapped.
- The curve is reflected over the diagonal line @math{y=x}.

@lesson-point{"An exponential relationship looks logarithmic...if your @math{x}'s and @math{y}'s trade places!"}

@slidebreak{Launch}
@ifnotslide{==== Asymptotes for Logarithmic Functions}
You may remember that exponential functions have @vocab{asymptotes}: lines that the functions approach but never cross.

@QandA{
@Q{Is the asymptote of an exponential function horizontal or vertical?}
@A{Horizontal, defined as @math{y = k}}
@A{As @math{y} approaches the asymptote, it grows or shrinks by exponentially smaller amounts that approach zero}
@Q{Given that logarithmic functions are the @vocab{inverse} of exponentials (reflected across @math{y = x}) what kind of asymptote do you think logarithmic functions have?}
@A{Vertical}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{

@teacher{Review student answers. Try to draw out student explanations for how they could tell whether a graph or plot was logarithmic instead of exponential. Their own reasoning is critical for building intuition, so you may even want to write down key phrases as students share them!

Computations with Exponents and Logarithms

We can use the @vocab{inverse} relationship between logarithms and exponents to do calculations.

Just as there are fact families for multiplication and division (_e.g._ @math{2 \times 3 = 6} @hspace{1em}@math{3 \times 2 = 6} @hspace{1em}@math{6 \div 2 = 3} @hspace{1em}@math{6 \div 3 = 2}), there are fact families for logarithms and exponents.

The two equations below are different ways of expressing the same relationship between the numbers 3, 5 and 125.

[cols="^1a, ^1a", options="header"]
|===
| Exponential Equation
| Logarithmic Equation

| @math{5^3 = 125}
| @math{\log_5 125 = 3}

*5* is our base in both the exponential and logarithmic equations above.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @opt-printable-exercise{evaluate-log.adoc} and complete the table in the first section by writing the related exponential or logarithmic equation for each row.
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
@Q{What *logarithmic* equation can we write from @math{x^y = z}?}
@A{@math{\log_x z = y}}

@Q{What *exponential* equation can we write from @math{\log_a b = c}?}
@A{@math{a^c = b}}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

When we want to evaluate log expressions, it is helpful to think about these fact families.

}
@Q{Which translation do you prefer, and why?}
@A{The first one, because it sets up a math problem and makes it clear what I need to do.}
@A{The second one, because the numbers are in the same order that they appear in the expression (I can read left-to-right).}
@Q{Is there another kind of translation that you like more?}

=== Overview

But how would we recognize a logarithmic sequence?

==== Logarithmic relationships help us survive!
}

@right{@image{images/alert.png, 100}}
It's very important for us to perceive a fire alarm as louder than a barking dog, but it's _not_ important to perceive how much louder one alarm is from another!

Our brains have evolved to be "optimized" for perceiving differences between "small" sights, sounds, smells, etc, but quickly lose the ability to distinguish between "big" ones.

@teacher{
This is known as the @link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law, Weber–Fechner law} states that the relationship between _stimulus_ (real-world sensory input) and _perception_ (how we perceive that input) is logarithmic!
}

@right{@image{images/decibels-table.png, 350}}@ifslide{@vocab{Logarithmic relationships} *allow us to compare things of very different sizes!*}

We don't *hear* the world as it really is. We hear a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- A fire alarm is _thousands of times louder_ than a dog barking, but our brains don't process that difference.
- When we hear a sound that is _ten times as loud_ as another, our brains perceive it to only be _twice_ as loud.
- _Exponentially increasing sound-strength_ is perceived as _constantly increasing loudness_, so @math{\text{perception}(\text{sound-strength})} is a logarithmic function.

We don't *taste* spiciness as it really is. We taste a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- The @link{https://ScovilleScale.org/chili-pepper-scoville-scale/, Scoville Scale} measures how spicy we perceive a pepper _feels_, based on the amount of capsaicin in the pepper.
- Each unit on the scale means there is an _exponentially greater amount of capsaicin_, so a pepper that measures a 4.0 actually contains _ten times the capsaicin_ of a 3.0.
- In other words, an _exponentially-increasing amount of capsaicin_ is perceived as a _constantly increasing spiciness_, so @math{\text{spiciness}(\text{capsaicin})} is a logarithmic function.

We don't *see* the world as it really is. We see a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- A fraction of our field of view shows us just a few feet of an airplane wing, but that same fraction shows us _hundreds of miles_ when looking at the ground far away.
- Railroad tracks stretching off towards the horizon, they appear to grow closer and closer until it looks like those parallel lines might touch.
- _Exponentially increasing distance_ is perceived as _constantly decreasing distance_, so @math{\text{perception}(\text{distance})} is a logarithmic function.

@teacher{
Students can check out @link{images/xkcd.png, this wonderful drawing} from @link{https://www.xkcd.com, XKCD}, which uses a logarithmic scale to fit *the entire known universe* into the image.

== Logarithmic Functions
@objective{logarithms-situations}
@objective{logarithms-model-settings}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the form of logarithmic models, and use a custom-built Desmos slider activity to explore how the model settings influence the shape of the model.

=== Launch
@slidebreak{Launch-DN}

Most textbooks teach that logarithmic models have the form: @hspace{1em} @big{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + k}}

That's because most textbooks only present logarithmic functions with a @vocab{horizontal shift} of zero... and when @math{h = 0}, we can safely remove it and use the simplified form of the equation.

But, just as with other models we have explored, logarithmic models can have horizontal shift. +
The expanded form for logarithmic models includes @math{h} and looks like this: @hspace{1em} @big{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x-h) + k}}

@teacher{
@opt{Advance your teacher dashboard of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos} to *Slide 3: How does h transform logarithmic functions?* and give your students time to reinforce their understanding of @math{h-values} from other models by connecting it to logarithmic functions.
}
}

=== Investigate
@slidebreak{Investigate-DN}

@teacher{
Sync or pace students to *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}. The following activity can be done two ways:

@hspace{2em} (1) Debrief with your students after they complete _each section_ of @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}. +
@hspace{2em} (2) Wait until they have completed the entire page.
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Desmos* file and explore how the constants in a logarithmic function definition impact the shape of its graph. 
- You should now be on *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions*.
- Use it to complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}.
}

@teacher{Review students answers, and then debrief via class discussion. Invite students to consider what new information they have gained by looking at graphical representations rather than tables.}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

==== Base @math{b}

The base of the logarithm is similar to the base (or @vocab{growth factor}) in an exponential expression...it just answers the opposite question!

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@QandA{
The expression @math{\log_2 1} is asking "to what power/exponent must 2 be raised to reach 1?
@Q{What power/exponent of 2 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What question is @math{\log_5 1} asking?}
@A{"To what power/exponent must 5 be raised, to reach 1?"}
@Q{What power/exponent of 5 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What can we conclude about logs that evaluate to 1?}
@A{They will always be zero, regardless of base!}
}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

@lesson-point{Since any number to the zero power is @math{1}... {nbsp}no matter the base, @math{log(1)} will always be zero!}

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-descriptions.adoc} and practice identifying whether the scenarios are best modeled by linear quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic functions.
- What clues did you use to help you identify which relationships were which?
}

@teacher{Have students share their answers. Be especially attentive to students who mislabel logarithmic relationships as "exponential" -- the relationship between the two is extremely subtle!}

@slidebreak{Investigate}

Most math books, Desmos, calculators, and programming languages offer a simple "log" function that doesn't specify a base. By convention, if the base isn't specified, _it's assumed to be base-10_.

- Pyret's `log` function uses base 10.
- Pyret's `log-base` function is for working with other bases. You'll find it in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Pages}.

@slidebreak{Investigate}

==== Vertical Shift @math{k}

The term @math{k} is the @vocab{vertical shift} of the function, which moves the curve up or down.

- Since @math{\log_{anything}1 = 0}, the value of a standard log model at @math{x=1} will always be @math{0 + k}.

- _Note: We've seen vertical shifts in other kinds of functions given different names, like @math{b} for linear functions._

@slidebreak{Investigate}

==== Logarithmic Coefficient @math{a}

The term @math{a} is called the @vocab{logarithmic coefficient}, which - along with the base (@math{b}) - affects the vertical stretch or compression of the logarithmic function and helps us determine how quickly the function grows.

@indented{
[cols="2a, 7a", stripes="none", options="header"]
|===
2+| When comparing two logarithmic functions with the same base (@math{b})

|If   @math{∣a∣ > 1}
|The graph of the function is vertically stretched, meaning it becomes steeper.

|If   @math{0 < ∣a∣ < 1}
|The graph of the function is vertically compressed, meaning it becomes less steep.

|If   @math{a < 0}
|In addition to being stretched or compressed, the graph is reflected across the x-axis.
|===
}

@teacher{
In the data exploration students just completed, remind them that the @vocab{asymptote} is always located on the y-axis (@math{x = 0}).

Extremely observant students may notice that there's a relationship between @math{a} and @math{b}, where the value of @math{2 \log_{10}(10) = \log_{10}(10^2)}!
