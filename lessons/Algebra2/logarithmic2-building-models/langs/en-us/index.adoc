= Building Logarithmic Models

@description{Students learn to transform the explanatory data (by building a new column that finds its log), use it to perform linear regression to produce the optimal linear model, and then use it to generate the optimal logarithmic model for the original (untransformed) data.}

@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on the same custom-built interactive Desmos activity we introduced in @lesson-link{logarithmic1-exploring-wealth-health}.
 * Set the pacing so that students are synced to you and only able to interact with the slide for the lesson section you are working on.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * If you don't already have a code, or you want to share a new one, you will first want to:
 *** Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 *** Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- This lesson assumes that students have been introduced to logarithms before, and are familiar with computation involving logarithmic functions.
- The focus of this lesson is about _applications_ of log functions, and builds an intuition for logarithmic computation by motivating substantial trial and error.

== From Exponents to Logarithms
@objective{logarithms-exponents}

=== Overview
Students are asked to consider the graphs of logarithmic functions as the reflection of an exponential function across the diagonal line @math{y=x}.

=== Launch

@teacher{Heads up: This launch refers back to data from @lesson-link{exponential1-exploring-covid}.}

The linear, quadratic and exponential models weâ€™ve found for the @starter-file{alg2-states} all made predictions with too much error to be useful. But what other kinds of models are there?

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{swapping-axes-n-w.adoc}.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
}

*The kind of growth we're seeing in the Countries dataset looks a lot like the Covid graph with the axes swapped!*

When we reflect the covid curve over @math{y=x}, the graph _starts_ with rapid growth, and then flattens out.

@ifnotslide{
@right{@image{images/crossfade.png, 350}}
We see that:

- During the pandemic, our initial value was roughly 120,000 cases.
- To reach 150,000 cases, it took 75 days
- To reach 300,000 cases, it took 112 days (37 additional days)
- To reach 400,000 cases, it took 122 days (20 additional days)

And we are much better able to understand just how quickly the infections were spreading.
}

@clear

*When we swap the axes, the model answers the opposite question!*

When an exponential relationship is "inverted" like this, the new shape is called a @vocab{logarithmic relationship}.

@lesson-point{"An exponential relationship looks logarithmic...if your @math{x}'s and @math{y}'s trade places!"}

Logarithmic functions and exponential functions serve as inverses of one another.

@indented{
- The Domain and Range are swapped.
- The axes are swapped.
- The curve is reflected over the diagonal line @math{y=x}.
}

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-graphs.adoc} and identify the form of each curve.
- For each display you identify as exponential or logarithmic, draw the diagonal line @math{y = x} and sketch the reflection of the curve.
}

@teacher{Review student answers. Try to draw out student explanations for how they could tell whether a graph or plot was logarithmic instead of exponential. Their own reasoning is critical for building intuition, so you may even want to write down key phrases as students share them!}

==== Optional: Computations with Exponents and Logarithms

We can use the inverse relationship between logarithms and exponents to do calculations.

Just as there are fact families for multiplication and division (@math{2 \times 3 = 6}, @math{3 \times 2 = 6}, @math{6 \div 2 = 3}, @math{6 \div 3 = 2}), there are fact families for logarithms and exponents.

The two equations below are different ways of expressing the same relationship between the numbers 3, 5 and 125.

[cols="^1a, ^1a", options="header"]
|===
| Exponential Equation
| Logarithmic Equation

| @math{5^3 = 125}
| @math{\log_5 125 = 3}
|===

@lesson-instruction{
Turn to @opt-printable-exercise{evaluate-log.adoc} and complete the table in the first section.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What logarithmic equation can we write from @math{x^y = z}?}
@A{@math{\log_x z = y}}

@Q{What exponential equation can we write from @math{\log_a b = c}?}
@A{@math{a^c = b}}
}

@slidebreak

When we want to evaluate log expressions, we need to think about those fact families.

|				| Expression 		| What you need to do 					| Evaluates to
| *Exponential* | @math{3^2}		| "Calculate 3 to the power of 2"		| 9
| *Logarithmic* | @math{\log_3(9)}	| "Calculate what power 3 is raised to in order to reach 9" | 2
|===


@QandA{
@Q{What question do we need to ask ourselves to evaluate @math{\log_3(81)}?}
@A{What power do we need to raise 3 to in order to reach 81?}
@Q{What will @math{\log_3(81)} evaluate to?}
@A{@math{4}, because @math{3^4 = 81}}
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete the rest of @opt-printable-exercise{evaluate-log.adoc} to get some practice translating and evaluating log expressions.
- Be sure to discuss your answers with at least one other student!
}

@QandA{
Consider these two translations of @math{\text{log}_2(128)}.

- "To get 128, I raise 2 to what power?"
- "The power you raise 2 to get 128"

@Q{Which translation do you prefer, and why?}
@A{The first one, because it sets up a math problem and makes it clear what I need to do.}
@A{The second one, because the numbers are in the same order that they appear in the expression (I can read left-to-right).}
}

=== Synthesize

@QandA{
@Q{How can we tell whether growth is exponential or logarithmic by looking at a graph?}
@A{Exponential growth is slow at first and gets faster. Logarithmic growth is fast at first and gets slower.}
@Q{What do we mean when we say that logarithmic functions and exponential functions serve as inverses of one another?}
@A{The axes are swapped.}
@A{The Domain and Range are swapped.}
@A{The models answer the opposite questions.}
@A{The curve is reflected over the diagonal line @math{y=x}.}

== Logarithmic Sequences
@objective{logarithms-growth}
@objective{logarithms-exponents}

=== Overview
Students learn to recognize logarithmic growth in tables.

=== Launch

We know that linear sequences can be recognized by their consistent growth. And exponential sequences can be recognized by identifying their growth factor. But how would we recognize a logarithmic sequence?

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-tables.adoc} and decide whether you think each table is best modeled by a quadratic, exponential or logarithmic function.
- If the table shows an exponential *or* logarithmic relationship, identify the base.

@QandA{
@Q{What strategies did you use to decide if a table represented a quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic function?}

@right{@image{images/decibels-table.png, 350}}@ifslide{@vocab{Logarithmic relationships} *allow us to compare things of very different sizes!*}

We don't *hear* the world as it really is. We hear a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- A fire alarm is _thousands of times louder_ than a dog barking, but our brains don't process that difference.
- When we hear a sound that is _ten times as loud_ as another, our brains perceive it to only be _twice_ as loud.
- _Exponentially increasing sound-strength_ is perceived as _constantly increasing loudness_, so @math{\text{perception}(\text{sound-strength})} is a logarithmic function.

We don't *taste* spiciness as it really is. We taste a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- The @link{https://ScovilleScale.org/chili-pepper-scoville-scale/, Scoville Scale} measures how spicy we perceive a pepper to be, based on the amount of capsaicin in the pepper.
- Each unit on the scale means there is an _exponentially greater amount of capsaicin_, so a pepper that measures a 4.0 actually contains _ten times the capsaicin_ of a 3.0.
- In other words, an _exponentially-increasing amount of capsaicin_ is perceived as a _constantly increasing spiciness_, so @math{\text{spicyness}(\text{capsaicin})} is a logarithmic function.

We don't *see* the world as it really is. We see a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- A fraction of our field of view shows us just a few feet of an airplane wing, but that same fraction shows us _hundreds of miles_ when looking at the ground far away.
- Railroad tracks stretching off towards the horizon, they appear to grow closer and closer until it looks like those parallel lines might touch.
- _Exponentially increasing distance_ is perceived as _constantly decreasing distance_, so @math{\text{perception}(\text{distance})} is a logarithmic function.

Students can check out @link{images/xkcd.png, this wonderful drawing} from @link{https://www.xkcd.com, XKCD}, which uses a logarithmic scale to fit *the entire known universe* into the image.

== Logarithmic Functions
@objective{logarithms-situations}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the parent function for logs, and explore the role the coefficients play.

=== Launch


Logarithmic models have the form: @hspace{1em} @big{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x-h) + k}}

But most textbooks only present logarithmic functions with a horizontal shift of zero.

When @math{h = 0}, we can safely remove it and use this simplified form of the equation: +

@center{@big{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + k}}}

@teacher{
@opt{Advance your teacher dashboard of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos} to *Slide 3: How does h transform logarithmic functions?* and give your students a chance to reinforce their understanding of @math{h-values} from other models by connecting it to logarithmic functions.
}
}

=== Investigate

@teacher{
Sync or pace students to *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}. The following activity can be done two ways:

@hspace{2em} (1) Debrief with your students after they complete _each section_ of @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc} +
@hspace{2em} (2) Wait until they have completed the entire page
}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Desmos* file and explore how the constants in a logarithmic function definition impact the shape of its graph. 
- You should now be on *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* 
- Use it to complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}
}

@teacher{Review students answers, and then debrief via class discussion. Invite students to consider what new information they have gained by looking at graphical representations rather than tables.}

@slidebreak

==== Base @math{b}

The base of the logarithm is similar to the base (or @vocab{growth factor}) in an exponential expression...it just answers the opposite question!

@slidebreak

@QandA{
The expression @math{	ext{log}_2(1)} is asking "to what power must 2 be raised to reach 1?
@Q{What power of 2 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What question is @math{	ext{log}_5(1)} asking?}
@A{"To what power must 5 be raised, to reach 1?"}
@Q{What power of 5 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What can we conclude about logs that evaluate to 1?}
@A{They will always be zero, regardless of base!}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{Since any number to the zero power is @math{1}, no matter the base, @math{log(1)} will always be zero!}

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-descriptions.adoc} and practice identifying whether the scenarios are best modeled by linear quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic functions.
- What clues did you use to help you identify which relationships were which?
}

@teacher{Have students share their answers. Be especially attentive to students who mis-label logarithmic relationships as "exponential" -- the relationship between the two is extremely subtle!}

@slidebreak

Most math books, Desmos, calculators, and programming languages offer a simple "log" function that doesn't specify a base. By convention, if the base isn't specified, _it's assumed to be base-10_.

- Pyret's `log` function uses base 10.
- Pyret's `log-base` function is for working with other bases. You'll find it in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Pages}.

@slidebreak

==== Vertical Shift @math{k}

The term @math{k} is the vertical shift of the function, which moves the curve up or down.

Since @math{\log_{anything}(1) = 0}, the value of a standard log model at @math{x=1} will always be @math{0 + k}.

(_We've seen vertical shifts in other kinds of functions given different names, like @math{b} for linear functions._)

@slidebreak

==== Logarithmic Coefficient @math{a}

The term @math{a} is called the logarithmic coefficient, which - like @math{b} - helps determine how quickly the function grows.

@QandA{
@Q{What do you remember about the asymptote of a function with exponential growth?}
@A{It's horizontal at @math{k}, where @math{y} grows or shrinks by smaller and smaller amounts approaching zero}
}

Functions with logarithmic growth have a *vertical asymptote* where the function gets closer and closer, but never crosses the line.

@teacher{In this data exploration, the @vocab{asymptote} will always be located on the y-axis (@math{x = 0}).

Extremely observant students may notice that there's a relationship between @math{a} and @math{b}, where the value of @math{2 \log_{10}(10) = \log_{10}(10^2)}!}
