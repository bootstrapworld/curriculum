@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on the same custom-built interactive Desmos activity we introduced in @lesson-link{logarithmic1-exploring-wealth-health}.
 * Set the pacing so that students are synced to you and only able to interact with the slide for the lesson section you are working on.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * If you don't already have a code, or you want to share a new one, you will first want to:
 *** Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 *** Make a link or code to share with your students.
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- This lesson assumes that students have been introduced to logarithms before, and are familiar with computation involving logarithmic functions.
- The focus of this lesson is about _applications_ of log functions, and builds an intuition for logarithmic computation by motivating substantial trial and error.
|===

== This Might Look Familiar...
@objective{logarithms-exponents}

=== Overview
Having identified that the wealth-v-lifespan scatter plot is neither linear, quadratic, nor exponential, students are asked to consider the graphs of logarithmic functions as the reflection of an exponential function across the diagonal line @math{y=x}.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- Open @starter-file{alg2-countries}, and make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `pc-gdp` and `median-lifespan`, using the name of the `country` as the label.
}

The linear, quadratic and exponential models we've found for this dataset all made predictions with too much error to be useful.

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete the first section of @printable-exercise{from-expt-to-log.adoc}.
- What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
}

@slidebreak

=== What does Reflecting the Data across the Diagonal @math{y=x} accomplish?

By switching the axes, the model answers the opposite question!  And our brains have a much better chance of understanding the speed of growth. Consider the growth of Covid Infections from Massachusetts (from @lesson-link{exponential1-exploring-covid}).

@scrub{
- The graph is showing us the relationship from +
_days → cases_, _x → y_, or _Domain → Range_.

The kind of growth we're seeing in the Countries dataset looks a lot like the Covid graph with the axes swapped!

- Now we want to *flip the relationship around*, asking for +
_cases → days_, _y → x_, or _Range → Domain_.
- What would *this* graph look like?

Having reflected the curve over @math{y=x}, the graph now _starts_ with rapid growth, and then flattens out.

- During the pandemic, our initial value was roughly 120,000 cases.
- To reach 150,000 cases, it took 75 days
- To reach 300,000 cases, it took 112 days (37 additional days)
- To reach 400,000 cases, it took 122 days (20 additional days)

And we understand just how fast the infections were growing.

=== Investigate

When an exponential relationship is "inverted" like this, the new shape is called a _logarithmic relationship._

@lesson-instruction{
- Using what you've just learned, turn to the second part of @printable-exercise{from-expt-to-log.adoc} and identify the form of each curve.
- For each display you identify as exponential or logarithmic, draw the diagonal line @math{y = x} and sketch the reflection of the curve.
}

@teacher{Review student answers. Try to draw out student explanations for how they could tell whether a graph or plot was logarithmic instead of exponential. Their own reasoning is critical for building intuition, so you may even want to write down key phrases as students share them!}

== Logarithmic Growth
@objective{logarithms-growth}
@objective{logarithms-exponents}

=== Overview
Students learn to think about logarithms as the inverse of an exponent. They learn to evaluate log expressions and to recognize logarithmic growth in tables.

=== Launch

By "reversing the question", logarithmic functions and exponential functions serve as inverses of one another:

- The inputs and outputs are reversed
- The Domain and Range are swapped
- The curve is reflected over the diagonal line @math{y=x}

@slidebreak

We can use this inverse relationship to do calculations:

[cols="^1a, ^1a", stripes="none" options="header"]

| Exponential
| Logarithmic

| @math{f(x) = 3^x}
| @math{g(x) = log_3(x)}

| What is 3 to the power of "the input"?
| What power does 3 need to be raised to reach "the input"?

| @math{f(2) = 3^2 = 9}
| @math{g(9) = log_3(9) = 2}
|===

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{What will @math{f(3)} evaluate to?}
@A{@math{f(3) = 3^3 = 27}}
@Q{What will @math{g(27)} evaluate to?}
@A{@math{g(27) = log_3(27) = 3}}
}

@slidebreak

Consider these two translations of @math{log_2(128)}.

- "To get 128, I raise 2 to what power?"
- "The power you raise 2 to get 128"

@QandA{
@Q{Which translation do you prefer, and why?}
@A{The first one, because it sets up a math problem and makes it clear what I need to do.}
@A{The second one, because the numbers are in the same order that they appear in the expression (I can read left-to-right).}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Complete @printable-exercise{evaluate-log.adoc} to get some practice translating and evaluating log expressions.
- Be sure to discuss your answers with at least one other student!

We don't *hear* the world as it really is. We hear a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- A fire alarm is _thousands of times louder_ than a dog barking, but our brains don't process that difference.
- When we hear a sound that is _ten times as loud_ as another, our brains perceive it to only be _twice_ as loud.
- _Exponentially increasing sound-strength_ is perceived as _constantly increasing loudness_, so @math{\text{perception}(\text{sound-strength})} is a logarithmic function.

We don't *taste* spiciness as it really is. We taste a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- The @link{https://ScovilleScale.org/chili-pepper-scoville-scale/, Scoville Scale} measures how spicy we perceive a pepper to be, based on the amount of capsaicin in the pepper.
- Each unit on the scale means there is an _exponentially greater amount of capsaicin_, so a pepper that measures a 4.0 actually contains _ten times the capsaicin_ of a 3.0.
- In other words, an _exponentially-increasing amount of capsaicin_ is perceived as a _constantly increasing spiciness_, so @math{\text{spicyness}(\text{capsaicin})} is a logarithmic function.

We don't *see* the world as it really is. We see a logarithmically compressed version of it!

- A fraction of our field of view shows us just a few feet of an airplane wing, but that same fraction shows us _hundreds of miles_ when looking at the ground far away.
- Railroad tracks stretching off towards the horizon, they appear to grow closer and closer until it looks like those parallel lines might touch.
- _Exponentially increasing distance_ is perceived as _constantly decreasing distance_, so @math{\text{perception}(\text{distance})} is a logarithmic function.

@teacher{
Students can check out @link{images/xkcd.png, this wonderful visualization} from @link{https://www.xkcd.com, XKCD}, which uses a logarithmic scale to draw the entire known universe. The constantly-increasing vertical distance in the picture represents an _exponentially-increasing_ distance, which is why the Eiffel Tower and Great Pyramid at the bottom appear "stretched out" at the bottom and "compressed" at the top!

== Logarithmic Functions
@objective{logarithms-situations}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the parent function for logs, and explore the role the coefficients play.

=== Launch

@teacher{
@opt{Advance your teacher dashboard of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos} to *Slide 3: How does h transform logarithmic functions?* and give your students a chance to reinforce their understanding of @math{h-values} from other models by connecting it to logarithmic functions.
}}

*Logarithmic models have the form: @hspace{1em} @big{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x-h) + k}}*

Most textbooks only present logarithmic functions with a horizontal shift of zero.

When @math{h = 0}, we can safely remove it and use this simplified form of the equation: @hspace{1em} @big{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + k}}

@teacher{Sync or pace students to *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}. The following activity can be done two ways:

@hspace{2em} (1) Debrief with your students after they complete _each section_ of @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc} +
@hspace{2em} (2) Wait until they have completed the entire page
}

=== Investigate
@lesson-instruction{

- You should now be on *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* 
- Use it to complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}
}

@teacher{Review students answers, and then debrief via class discussion. Invite students to consider what new information they have gained by looking at graphical representations rather than tables.}

==== Base @math{b}

The base of the logarithm is similar to the base (or @vocab{growth factor}) in an exponential expression...it just answers the opposite question!

|@math{3^2} 
|@math{\log_3(9)} 

| "calculate 3 to the power of 2"
| "calculate what power 3 is raised to in order to reach 9"

| Evaluates to 9
| Evaluates to 2
|===

@slidebreak

@QandA{
The expression @math{log_2(1)} is asking "to what power must 2 be raised to reach 1?
@Q{What power of 2 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What question is @math{log_5(1)} asking?}
@A{"To what power must 5 be raised, to reach 1?"}
@Q{What power of 5 will evaluate to 1?}
@A{Zero}
@Q{What can we conclude about logs that evaluate to 1?}
@A{They will always be zero, regardless of base!}
}

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{No matter the base, @math{log(1)} will always be zero!}

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-descriptions.adoc} and practice identifying whether the scenarios are best modeled by linear quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic functions.
- What clues did you use to help you identify which relationships were which?
}

@teacher{Have students share their answers. Be especially attentive to students who mis-label logarithmic relationships as "exponential" -- the relationship between the two is extremely subtle!}

@slidebreak

Most math books, Desmos, calculators, and programming languages offer a simple "log" function that doesn't specify a base. By convention, if the base isn't specified, _it's assumed to be base-10_. Pyret's `log` function works the same way:

@center{`log(1000) # returns 3, because 10^3 = 1000`}

If you want to work with a different base, you can look up Pyret's `log-base` function in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, Contracts Pages}.

@slidebreak

==== Vertical Shift @math{k}

The term @math{k} is the vertical shift of the function, which moves the curve up or down.

Since @math{log_{anything}(1) = 0}, the value of a standard log model at @math{x=1} will always be @math{0 + k}.

(_We've seen vertical shifts in other kinds of functions given different names, like @math{b} for linear functions._)

@slidebreak

==== Logarithmic Coefficient @math{a}

The term @math{a} is called the logarithmic coefficient, which - like @math{b} - helps determine how quickly the function grows.

@QandA{
@Q{What do you remember about the asymptote of a function with exponential growth?}
@A{It's horizontal at @math{k}, where @math{y} grows or shrinks by smaller and smaller amounts approaching zero}
}

Functions with logarithmic growth have a *vertical asymptote* where the function gets closer and closer, but never crosses the line.

@teacher{In this data exploration, the @vocab{asymptote} will always be located on the y-axis (@math{x = 0}).

Extremely observant students may notice that there's a relationship between @math{a} and @math{b}, where the value of @math{2 \log_{10}(10) = \log_{10}(10^2)}!}
