= Sense Making from Logarithmic Models: @math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + k}

The logarithmic model we've defined is: @fitb{}{}

It tries to predict @fitbruby{20em}{}{y-variable} from @fitbruby{}{}{x-variable}

== Logarithmic Coefficient (@math{a})

Since @math{a} is @fitbruby{8em}{}{negative / positive}, we know that our quadratic model curves @fitbruby{6em}{}{up / down}.

Because @math{|a|}} is @fitbruby{10em}{}{less / greater} than @math{1}, the graph of the function will be @fitbruby{6em}{}{steeper / less steep} than the parent function @math{f(x) = \log(x)}.

== Vertical Shift (@math{k}) 

Because @math{k =} @fitb{6em}{}, we know that:

- the model will sit @fitbruby{20em}{}{higher / lower / in the same position} on the graph than the parent model
- when @math{x = 1}, @math{y =} @fitb{10em}{}

== Horizontal Shift (@math{h})

Because @math{h} @fitbruby{6em}{}{is / isn't} referenced in this model, we know that 

- the model will sit @fitbruby{20em}{}{to the right / to the left / in the same position} on the graph as the parent model
- there will be a @fitbruby{20em}{}{horizontal / vertical} asymptote at @fitb{10em}{}

This means that @fitb{}{}

== Base (@math{b})

Because @math{b =} @fitb{}{6em}, which is @fitbruby{10em}{}{bigger / smaller} than 10, we know that the curve will be @fitbruby{10em}{}{steeper / less steep} than the parent model. 

== S-value in Context

This model was built using data about 
@fitbruby{6em}{}{how many?}
@fitbruby{}{}{what?} +
whose 
@fitbruby{10em}{}{x-variable} ranged from
@fitbruby{10em}{}{x-min} to
@fitbruby{10em}{}{x-max}
@fitbruby{}{}{x-variable units} 

@vspace{1ex}

Possible limitations of this model include @fitb{}{}
@fitbruby{80em}{}{uneven distribution, high variability, small sample size, etc.}

*The error in the model* is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about
@fitbruby{5em}{}{S}
@fitbruby{8em}{}{y-units}. @hspace{1em} I
@fitbruby{18em}{}{strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree} that this model is a good fit considering that
@fitbruby{10em}{}{y-variable units} in this dataset range from
@fitbruby{10em}{}{lowest y-value} to
@fitbruby{}{}{highest y-value}
