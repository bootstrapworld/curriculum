The scatter plots below were made with the same data... we just _swapped_ the x- and y-axes.

- The first scatter plot shows an *exponential relationship*: the number of Covid Infections as a function of Days
- The second scatter plot shows a *logarithmic relationship*: Days as a function of Infections

| @ifsoln{
- Answers will vary.
- The exponential relationship rises slowly at first, then quickly.
- The logarithmic relationship rises quickly at first, then slowly.
- They are reflections of each other across a diagonal line.
}

@ifsoln{
- Why would growth get faster or slower?
- Can you flip the axes for any dataset?
- Why is there that little break in the curve?
- What is the form of a logarithmic function?
}
