An AI was asked to fit a logarithmic model to each of the scatter plots below. Did the AI do a good job? +
(_HINT: try drawing the curve-of-best-fit for these plots!_)

@ifsoln{The AI seems to have gotten the magnitude of the logarithmic coefficient right, but not the sign. The data should be modeled by logarithmic _decay_, not growth! So the model should be @math{-10 log(x)}.

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{The AI correctly determined a shift of 10, but the correct model should have been @math{f(x) =  5logx + 10} because the data is best modeled by a vertical shift of 10 not a horizontal shift.

@center{*AI's Suggested Model:* @math{f(x) = -50 log(x) - 70}}

@n What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{AI got the coefficient of -50 and the asymptote at x=0 correct, but is incorrect with the vertical shift in that it said -70 while it is only -20. Using AI's function, as x approaches zero, y approaches -20. We need to add 50 to the k value in order to raise y to the approximate 30 in our graph.

@star What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?

@blanklines{5}{
@ifsoln{The logarithmic coefficient is right, but the horizontal shift is definitely wrong. With 10 being added to @math{x} in the model, the curve should be shifted left. But in the scatter plot, the curve of best fit is shifted 10 to the right.
