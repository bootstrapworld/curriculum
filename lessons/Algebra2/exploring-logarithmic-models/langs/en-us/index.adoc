Discuss students' findings. Pay special attention to the @vocab{form} that students use to describe the pattern in the scatter plot. Is it linear, or something else? Is it strong or weak? If there's some disagreement among the students, that's a good thing!

Be attentive to sense-making: If a wealthy country is suffering heavy causalties in a war, where would we expect to see the datapoint? Why? What other conditions would cause a point to shift up, down, left or right?

== Transforming the x-Axis @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover that by transforming the x-axis, they can fit a linear model to a logarithmic relationship.

=== Launch

@center{@image{images/wealth-v-life-linear.png}}

There definitely appears to be a relationship here, but it's not one we've seen before. Using `lr-plot` only shows a moderate correlation, because the straight line doesn't really fit the curve. The shape of this starts out rising fast on the left, before tapering off as `pc-gdp` increases to the right.

[.lesson-instruction]
How well did our linear, quadratic, and exponential models fit this data? Is there another kind of function that starts off rising fast, but then levels off quickly?

=== Investigate

The shape of this relationship is _logarithmic_, meaning it can be modeled using a logarithmic function:

@center{@math{f(x) = b \times log(x) + c} }

We need to find @math{b} and @math{c}, such that the model fits the data as closely as possible.

@teacher{Crowdsource the values students came up with for @math{b} and @math{c} in their best-guess logarithmic model. Were they very similar or very different? What were the @math{R^2} values?}

Trial-and-error only gets us so far, and it's not clear that we would ever stumble upon the optimal model. **We need something like Pyret's `lr-plot` function, which uses computational methods to find the best possible model.** Unfortunately, `lr-plot` only finds linear models. If only we could _transform_ this data to make it appear linear! Then we could use `lr-plot` to fit the optimal model, and then reverse the transformation to get the optimal logarithmic model!

Imagine that the scatter plot is printed on a sheet of rubber, and can be stretched or squashed in any way we want. Data Scientists often use *transformations* to stretch their data into shapes that are easier to use, and then reverse the transformation when they are done.

* A person running on a treadmill is still standing in the same place. Why?
** Their forward movement is balanced by the backwards movement of the treadmill.
* If they run faster and faster, what needs to happen to the treadmill to keep them in the same place?
** The treadmill needs to go faster as well - by the same amount.

As long as the treadmill speed increases at the same rate as the runner, they will _balance one another's growth_. That's the same thing that's happening in our transformed graph!

By __transforming the x-axis__ to grow exponentially, we are "squashing" the coordinate plane so that each interval of  represents 10x the growth in `pc-gdp` as the one before it. This balances  the logarithmic growth in `median-lifespan`, makes the curved relationship appear linear, and warps our logarithmic model so it looks like a straight line-of-best-fit.

@title{Going Deeper: Connecting to Inverse Functions}

While this doesn't cover inverses in any real depth, the treadmill analogy opens the door to discussing how one kind of change can "cancel out" or "undo" another. A person running at a constant speed is adding distance per unit time, which is inverted by the treadmill subtracting that same distance per unit time.

In Desmos, the tick marks on the Desmos axis increased exponentially when we switched to a log scale. If that person were accelarating exponentially, the treadmill would need to do so as well.
|===

=== Synthesize

- How does seeing the point cloud as linear help is think about logarithmic growth?
- What if we wanted to change the axis to show a quadratic scale? Or something more complicated?

Even our best-guess logarithmic model looks like a straight line. But transforming the axes only makes things _look_ linear - the actual points haven't changed at all, and we still can't use linear regression to find the best model.


== Transforming the Data @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students learn to transform the data into a linear shape, building a new column by applying a function to each row. This new data can be fit with a linear model. By applying the _inverse_ of this transformation to their linear model, they retrieve the logarithmic model.

=== Launch

Instead of transforming the x-axis, another strategy is to _transform the x-coordinates themselves_. Instead of plotting `pc-gdp` on a logarithmic x-axis, we could plot `log(gdp)` on a linear x-axis.

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{transforming-data.adoc}, using @online-exercise{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hgp5a9n7it, Wealth-v-Health - Transformed}.

Transforming the points instead of the axis has the same visual effect: the dots appear to fall in a straight line! But now we can plot them on a linear-scale axis, and use linear regression to find the best-possible model!

@teacher{
Crowdsource the coefficients (slope and y-intercept) of the linear models students come up with. How close are they to one another? How close are they to the coefficients from the best-guess logarithmic model?

They will discover that they match the coefficients of the logarithmic model as well!
}

[.lesson-instruction]
As a class: why do these coefficients match?

=== Investigate

We transformed the `pc-gdp` column in two steps:

. We defined a transformation function - @math{g(x)} - which produces the log of whatever it's given (the `pc-gdp` column).
. We defined a new column to use as our x-values, populating it by applying the transformation to each of our original x-values.
. We displayed these transformed datapoints as a scatterplot.

**It's easy to do the same thing in Pyret!**

In @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1SGzPWywGy63-DaqOVTy39-497lcWaF4B, Countries of the World Starter File}, find the definition of `g(r)`.

* What does this function do?
** `g` produces the log of the `pc-gdp` column, which it gets from the country it's given
** Find the contract for `build-column` in your Contracts page. What is its Range?
** Table
* What is its Domain?
** A Table, A String, and a Function

At the end of the program, you'll find this code:

@show{(code '(define countries-transformed (build-column countries-table "log(pc-gdp)" g)))}

Click "Run", and evaluare `countries-transformed` in the Interactions Area on the right.

* What did you get back?
** A Table
* What is different about this Table?
** It has an extra column called "log(pc-gdp)"
* Where did the column on the right come from?
** It was created by `build-column`, which named it `"log(pc-gdp)` and filled it using the function `g`
* What does that line of code at the end of the program do?
** It defines a new table called `countries-transformed`, which is the result of building our new column


@right{@image{images/wealth-v-life-transformed-linear.png, 550}}
Success! Just like in Desmos, transforming the `pc-gdp` column with a log function produces a scatter plot showing a linear pattern in the data! Pyret's `lr-plot` tool computes the best possible linear model for our transformed data, determining it to have a slope of `11.9011` and a y-intercept of `24.2636`. Our @math{R^2} has jumped to 0.66311, showing a vastly better correlation than before.

@clear

With the transformation applied, our linear model (in both function and Pyret notation) is:

- @math{f(x) = 11.9011x + 24.2636}
- @show{(code '(define (f x) (+ (* 11.9011 x) 24.2636)))}

At each point in our linear model, @math{f} is the _predicted median lifespan_, and @math{x} is the _log of per-capita gdp_. But we want @math{x} to represent the **original, un-transformed** value, simply using _per-capita gdp_ as-is.

From @printable-exercise{transforming-data.adoc}, we know that the coefficients used in the transformed, linear model are the same ones used in the logarithmic, un-transformed model:

- @math{h(x) = 11.9011 \times log(x) + 24.2636}
- @show{(code '(define (h x) (+ (* 11.9011 (log x)) 24.2636)))}

The resulting logarithmic model can be fit to our original scatter plot, showing a much better fit than our 2-point-derived estimates.

@star Optional Exploration: Is the relationship between lifespan and income different for countries with universal healthcare than without it? Have students `filter` this dataset into grouped samples for each, and find out!

=== Synthesize

- Why is the @math{R^2} value for our logarithmic model the same as the value for our linear model after transforming?
- Why were our coefficients for linear and logarithmic models the same, even though they were for different terms?
- How do you interpret this model?
- Why do you think the relationship between wealth is logarithmic?
- Are there other relationships you can think of, which might be logarithmic?
