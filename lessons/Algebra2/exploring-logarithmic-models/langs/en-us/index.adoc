@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. + 
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first three slides. _(As the lesson progresses you will be directed to adjust the pacing or sync students to you so that they have access to relevant slides.)_
- _If you're a first-time Desmos user, fear not!_ @dist-link{pages/desmos-instructions-alg2.adoc, _Here's what you need to do._}

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- This lesson assumes that students have been introduced to logarithms before, and are familiar with computation involving logarithmic functions.
- The focus of this lesson is about _applications_ of log functions, and builds an intuition for logarithmic computation by motivating substantial trial and error.

== Looking for Patterns  @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the @starter-file{alg2-countries}, and find a relationship between wealth and median life expectancy. They also learn how to build a new column for a table in Pyret.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- @right{@image{images/questions.png, 250}}Do you think people living in wealthier countries generally live longer?
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-countries}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{exploring-countries.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
Discuss students' findings. Pay special attention to the @vocab{form} that students use to describe the pattern in the scatter plot. Is it linear, or something else? Is it strong or weak? If there's some disagreement among the students, that's a good thing!

Be attentive to sense-making: If a wealthy country is suffering heavy casualties in a war, where would we expect to see that country's datapoint? Why? What other conditions would cause a point to shift up, down, left or right?
}
=== Investigate

@teacher{Make sure you have created a link or code for your class to @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos} and paced the class so they have access to only slides 2 and 3 (or to only the first 3 slides if you want them to also be able to play with a slider for a linear model).}

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the *Desmos* link I've shared with you. (The file should be called *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models*.)
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{fitting-models.adoc}.}

@teacher{
This activity involves lots of trial and error, as students try to come up with a good linear, quadratic, or exponential model. +
The goal is to discover that a new kind of model is necessary, not to find a perfect fit with linear, quadratic, or exponential models!
}
=== Synthesize

@teacher{Direct students to look at the scatter plot they created in Pyret of `median-lifespan` versus `pc-gdp`.}

@QandA{
@Q{What's the best model you came up with?}
@Q{What kinds of lines or curves did you draw?}
@Q{How would you describe the shape of the scatter plot for `median-lifespan` versus `pc-gdp`?}
@A{It starts out rising fast on the left, before tapering off as `pc-gdp` increases to the right.}
@Q{How well did our linear, quadratic, and exponential models fit this data?}
@A{None of the kinds of functions we've seen so far exhibit the behavior we see here! In some ways, this behavior is the exact opposite of exponentials: instead of starting slow and taking off like a rocket, this curve explodes up the y-axis right away, before leveling off.}
}

== Logarithmic Functions	@duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview
Having identified that the wealth-v-lifespan scatter plot is neither linear, nor quadratic, nor exponential, students learn about characteristics of logarithmic functions in graphical, tabular, and function notation form.

=== Launch

All of the models we just found for our dataset made predictions with enough error to render them useless, so it's time to learn about another kind of model called a @vocab{logarithmic function}!

The behavior of logarithmic growth is the _reverse_ of exponential growth.

| Logarithmic Function


|We know that exponential functions grow by _equal factors over the same interval_. We can describe their growth by calculating the @vocab{growth factor}: "what @math{y} is multiplied by" in order to produce the next value over a constant interval.
|Instead of multiplying @math{y} by a constant to find the next value, we need to _multiply the size of our x-interval_ by a constant (called the @vocab{base}) in order to get a constant growth in @math{y}!

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-tables.adoc} and decide whether you think each table is best modeled by a quadratic, exponential or logarithmic function.
- If the table shows a logarithmic relationship, identify the base.
}

@teacher{Have students share their answers. For logarithmic functions, it's especially important to have students talk about the @vocab{base}: how much @math{x} needs to increase just to get a fixed increase in @math{y}!}

@QandA{
- What strategies did you use to decide if a table represented a quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic function?
- Was it especially difficult (or simple) to recognize any these function types? Why?
}

@slidebreak

@vocab{Logarithmic relationships} - like the ones you identified on tables 1, 4, and 6 - grow or decay very quickly at first, but then level out as @math{x} increases. Our intervals need to grow longer and longer just to reach a small change in @math{y}!

For example, it might take 10 steps to go from @math{1} to @math{2}, but then a hundred more to get to @math{3} and a _thousand_ more to get to @math{4}.

=== Investigate

@teacher{Sync or pace students to *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}. 

Decide whether you want to debrief this activity with your students after they complete each section or wait until they have finished completing @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}.}

Logarithmic models have the form @math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + c}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Desmos* file and explore how the constants in a logarithmic function definition impact the shape of its graph. 
- You should now be on *Slide 4: Exploring Logarithmic Functions* 
- Use it to complete @printable-exercise{graphing-models.adoc}
}

@teacher{Review students answers, and then debrief via class discussion. Invite students to consider what new information they have gained by looking at graphical representations rather than tables.}

@slidebreak

==== Base @math{b}

*The base @math{b} of the logarithm* is similar to the base in an exponential expression.

[cols="^1a,^1a", stripes="none", options="header"]
|===
| Exponential Expression
| Logarithmic Expression

|@math{3^2} 
|@math{\log_3(9)} 

| "calculate 3 to the power of 2"
| "calculate what power 3 is raised to in order to reach 9"

| Evaluates to 9
| Evaluates to 2
|===

And, since anything to the power of zero is always 1, the log of 1 will always be zero - _for any base!_

@opt{For practice translating logarithmic expressions into words and evaluating them turn to @opt-printable-exercise{evaluate-log.adoc}.}

@slidebreak

Most math books, Desmos, calculators, and programming languages offer a simple "log" function that doesn't specify a base. By convention, if the base isn't specified, _it's assumed to be base-10_. Pyret's `log` function works the same way!

If you want to work with a different base, you can look up Pyret's `log-base` function in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, contracts pages}.


==== Vertical Shift @math{c}

*The term @math{c} is the vertical shift* of the function, which moves the curve up or down. +
(_We've seen vertical shifts in other kinds of functions given different names, like @math{k} for quadratics and @math{b} for linear function._) 

Because @math{\log_{\mbox{anything}}(1) = 0}

- the logarithmic term will always be zero at @math{x=1}
- @math{y} will always be the value of @math{c} at @math{x=1}

@slidebreak

==== Logarithmic Coefficient @math{a}

*The term @math{a} is called the logarithmic coefficient*, which - like @math{b} - determines how quickly the function grows.

Logarithmic models have a *vertical @vocab{asymptote}* where the function increases or decreases boundlessly.

@teacher{In this data exploration, the @vocab{asymptote} will always be located on the y-axis (@math{x = 0}).

Extremely observant students may notice that there's a relationship between @math{a} and @math{b}, where the value of @math{2 \log_{10}(10) = \log_{10}(10^2)}!}

@slidebreak

==== Logarithmic Relationships allow us to compare things of very different sizes!

We observed a logarithmic relationship between wealth and lifespan in our Countries of the World dataset. 

There are lots of relationships like this, *where the function grows or decays very quickly at first, but then moves at a glacial pace the farther out it goes.*

- We _perceive_ loudness on a base-10 logarithmic scale. We can hear a pin drop, but we can also process sounds as loud as a fog horn without getting hurt. A fire alarm is _thousands of times louder_ than a dog barking, but our brains don't process that difference. For us to perceive a sound as being twice as loud as another, it actually has to be _a hundred times as loud_.

@slidebreak

@indented{@right{@image{images/decibels-table.png, 350}}The table to the right shows different sounds as measured by _intensity_ (@math{watts/meter^2}, known as "flux") and in _decibels_.

_Flux_ is something objective and measurable: louder sounds are generated from higher flux.

But as humans with logarithmic _perceptions_ of loudness, we instead measure "loudness" on a scale that matches our _perception._
}

@clear
@slidebreak

- Scientists use logarithms to be able to fit things of very divergent magnitudes onto the same scale. For example:
  * pH measures acidity such that pH of 6 is ten times as acidic as pH of 7. By using a logarithmic scale, we can put orange juice (pH=3) and milk (pH=6.8) on the same scale, even though the OJ is nearly 10000 as acidic. _How many times more acidic is acid rain on Venus (pH=1) than Van Lake in Turkey (pH=9.8), the world's largest soda lake?_ 
  * The Richter Scale measures the magnitude of earthquakes. By using a logarithmic scale when can put the 2011 earthquake in Japan (9.0) on the same scale as an earthquake caused by a stick of dynamite (1.2) even though one was nearly 100 million times bigger than the other!

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{classifying-descriptions.adoc} and practice identifying whether the scenarios are best modeled by linear quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic functions.
- What clues did you use to help you identify which relationships were which?
}

@teacher{Have students share their answers. Be especially attentive to students who mis-label logarithmic relationships as "exponential" -- the relationship between the two is extremely subtle!}


=== Synthesize
- What _similarities_ do you see between exponential and logarithmic functions?
- What _differences_ do you see between exponential and logarithmic functions?

== Fitting by Changing Scale @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover that when a logarithmic relationship is graphed on an _exponential_ scale, the point cloud appears linear. When trying to use linear regression with those points, however, they are reminded that merely changing the scale of a graph does not actually change the data.

This section builds the foundation for _linearization_, transforming the points themselves, which students will do in the following section. (Note: this also opens the door for teaching inverse functions!)

=== Launch

@teacher{Sync or pace students to __Slide 5: Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)__ of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Let's return to the *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models Desmos file*.
- You should now be on the slide 5: "Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)".
- Use it to complete the first section of @printable-exercise{changing-scale.adoc}.
}

@QandA{
@Q{What values did you come up with for @math{a} and @math{c} in your best-guess logarithmic model?}
@A{Record different students' responses for @math{a} and @math{c} on the board.}
@Q{How do your @math{a} and @math{c} values compare with those of other students'? Are they very similar or very different?}
@Q{What were the @math{S} values for these models?}
}

@slidebreak

Trial-and-error only gets us so far, and it's not clear that we would ever stumble upon the optimal model. 

@lesson-point{
We need something like Pyret's `lr-plot`, which uses computational methods to find the optimal model.}

Unfortunately, `lr-plot` only finds _linear_ models in data with _linear_ relationships.

Data Scientists often use transformations to stretch their data into shapes that are easier to work with, and then reverse the transformation when they are done. If only we could _transform_ this data to make it appear linear. Then we could use `lr-plot` to fit the optimal model, and then reverse the transformation to get the optimal logarithmic model!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Imagine that the scatter plot is printed on a sheet of rubber, and can be stretched or squashed in any way we want... 
- With that image in mind, follow the directions on the last section of @printable-exercise{changing-scale.adoc}.
}

@teacher{Students will be switching the x-axis of their graph from linear to logarithmic in this section. Make sure they are toggling back and forth between the two views as they look for the best-fitting model.}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{A person running on a treadmill doesn't change location. Why not?}
@A{Their forward movement is balanced by the backwards movement of the treadmill.}
@Q{If they run faster and faster, what needs to happen to the treadmill to keep them in the same place?}
@A{The treadmill needs to go faster as well. As long as the treadmill speed increases at the same rate as the runner, they will balance one another's growth.}
@Q{How is the treadmill example comparable to what we've done with our x-axis transformation?}
@A{We are speeding up the growth intervals on the x-axis to "keep up with" the speed of growth in the data so that we can see the pattern better.}
}

When we changed Desmos's view from "Linear" to "Logarithmic", we made the x-axis grow faster and "squish" the dots so they appear linear. By _transforming the x-axis_ to grow exponentially, we are squashing the coordinate plane so that each interval on the x-axis represents 10x the growth in `pc-gdp` as the one before it. This balances out the logarithmic growth in `median-lifespan`, and warps our logarithmic model so the curved looks like linear.


@strategy{Going Deeper: Connecting to Inverse Functions}{

While this metaphor doesn't cover inverses in any real depth, the treadmill analogy opens the door to discussing how one kind of change can "cancel out" or "undo" another. 

We are working to add additional material on inverse functions to our Algebra 2 materials, and hope to release them in the coming year!
}

=== Synthesize

- How does seeing the point cloud as linear help us think about logarithmic growth?
- Transforming the axes only makes things _look_ linear - the actual points haven't changed at all, and we still can't use linear regression to find the best logarithmic model... Can you think of a way we could transform the _data_, instead of the axes?

== Fitting by Transforming Data @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview

Having discovered that changing the scale of a graph allows us to _see_ logarithmic growth as linear, but still doesn't allow us to _treat_ it as linear, students learn to *transform the data* by applying a function to each row and building a new column that can be fit with a linear model. By applying the _inverse_ of this transformation to their computed linear model, students can derive the optimal logarithmic model.

=== Launch

We tried changing the scale on the x-axis from linear to exponential, which cancels out the logarithmic behavior by _shrinking the x-axis_ to make intervals that grow by 10x appear to grow linearly. Another strategy is to *shrink the data*, by *transforming the x-coordinates themselves*. Instead of plotting `pc-gdp` on a logarithmic x-axis, we could plot `log(pc-gdp)` on a _linear_ one.

@slidebreak

@teacher{Sync or pace students to __Slide 6: Wealth-v-Health (Transformed)__ of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.}

@lesson-instruction{

- You should now be on slide 6: "Wealth-v-Health (Transformed)".
- Use it to complete @printable-exercise{transforming-data.adoc} (the whole page, not just the first section).
}

@QandA{
@Q{What values did you come up with for our coefficients @math{m} and @math{b} in your best-guess linear model?}
@A{Record different students' responses for @math{m} and @math{b} on the board.}
@A{These numbers should be somewhat close to their earlier responses for @math{a} and @math{c}!}
@Q{Were those values very similar or very different?}
@Q{How close were the values from our best-guess logarithmic model?}
}
@slidebreak
@QandA{
@Q{How was transforming the data similar to changing the scale on the x-axis?}
@A{Transforming the data and changing the scale both made the logarithmic relationship look linear.}
@Q{How was it different?}
@A{Changing the scale just made things *look* linear, but the data wasn't any different so we still couldn't use linear regression on it.}
}

@slidebreak

Transforming the points instead of the axis has the same visual effect: the dots appear to fall in a straight line. But now we can plot them on a linear-scale axis, and use linear regression to find the best-possible model!

This transformation changed the _kind of growth_ from logarithmic to linear: instead of increasing logarithmically by @math{a}, our new function increases _linearly_ by @math{a}.

The term went from @math{a \log_{10}(x)} to @math{ax}, turning our logarithmic coefficient into..._*slope*_.

=== Investigate

We transformed the `pc-gdp` column in three steps:

1. We defined a transformation function, @math{g(x)}, which produces the log of whatever it's given (the `pc-gdp` column).
2. We defined a new column to use as our x-values, populating it by applying the transformation to each of our original x-values.
3. We displayed these transformed datapoints as a scatter plot.

If we can do this in Pyret, *we could run linear regression on the transformed data*, and then use what we know about the coefficients to *turn our optimal linear model into an optimal _logarithmic_ one!*

@slidebreak

@lesson-instruction{
- Turn to @printable-exercise{logarithmic-models.adoc}.
- Complete the first part ("Transforming: From Logarithmic Plots to Linear Ones"), then pause for class discussion.

@teacher{Address any student questions about `build-column`, the Pyret function they've just discovered. Verify that students have recorded the slope and vertical shift for their regression line. Then, emphasize the key ideas below.}

@slidebreak

- At each point in our linear model, @math{y} is the _predicted median lifespan_, and @math{x} is the _log of per-capita gdp in thousands_.

- We want @math{x} to represent the *original, un-transformed* value, simply using _per-capita gdp in thousands_ as-is...

@slidebreak

@lesson-point{
We've learned that:

- the *slope* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *log coefficient* in the un-transformed logarithmic model

- the *vertical shift* in the transformed, linear model is the same as the *vertical shift* in the un-transformed logarithmic model

@indented{@show{(code '(define (logarithmic3 x) (+ (* 11.9011 (log x)) 59.967)))}}

The resulting logarithmic model can be fit to our original scatter plot, showing a much better fit than our 2-point-derived estimates.
