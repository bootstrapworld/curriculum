@preparation{
- Much of the exploration in this lesson hinges on a custom-built interactive Desmos activity. + 
You will want to:
 * Open @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.
 * Make a link or code to share with your students.
 * Decide how you will share the link or code with students and, if you are using our Google Slides, add the appropriate link to the slide deck.
 * Set the pacing so that students are only able to interact with the first two slides. _(As the lesson progresses you will be directed to adjust the pacing or sync students to you so that they have access to relevant slides.)_

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
- This lesson assumes that students have been introduced to logarithms before, and are familiar with computation involving logarithmic functions.
- The focus of this lesson is about _applications_ of log functions, and builds an intuition for logarithmic computation by motivating substantial trial and error.

== Looking for Patterns  @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the @starter-file{alg2-countries}, and find a relationship between wealth and median life expectancy. They also learn how to build a new column for a table in Pyret.

=== Launch

@lesson-instruction{
- @right{@image{images/questions.png, 250}}Do you think people living in wealthier countries generally live longer?
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-countries}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run".
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{exploring-countries.adoc}.
}

@teacher{
Discuss students' findings. Pay special attention to the @vocab{form} that students use to describe the pattern in the scatter plot. Is it linear, or something else? Is it strong or weak? If there's some disagreement among the students, that's a good thing!

Be attentive to sense-making: If a wealthy country is suffering heavy casualties in a war, where would we expect to see that country's datapoint? Why? What other conditions would cause a point to shift up, down, left or right?
}
=== Investigate

@teacher{Make sure you have created a link or code for your class to @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos} and paced the class so they have access to the first 2 slides.}

@lesson-instruction{
- Open the *Desmos* link I've shared with you. (The file should be called *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models*.)
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete @printable-exercise{fitting-models.adoc}.}

@teacher{
This activity involves lots of trial and error, as students try to come up with a good linear, quadratic, or exponential model. +
The goal is to discover that a new kind of model is necessary, not to find a perfect fit with linear, quadratic, or exponential models!
}
=== Synthesize

@teacher{Direct students to look at the scatter plot they created in Pyret of `median-lifespan` versus `pc-gdp`.}

@QandA{
@Q{What's the best model you came up with?}
@Q{What kinds of lines or curves did you draw?}
@Q{How would you describe the shape of the scatter plot for `median-lifespan` versus `pc-gdp`?}
@A{It starts out rising fast on the left, before tapering off as `pc-gdp` increases to the right.}
@Q{How well did our linear, quadratic, and exponential models fit this data?}
@A{None of the kinds of functions we've seen so far exhibit the behavior we see here! In some ways, this behavior is the exact opposite of exponentials: instead of starting slow and taking off like a rocket, this curve explodes up the y-axis right away, before leveling off.}
}

== Logarithmic Functions

=== Overview
Having identified that the wealth-v-lifespan scatter plot is neither linear, nor quadratic, nor exponential, students learn about characteristics of logarithmic functions in graphical, tabular, and function notation form.

=== Launch

All of the models we just found for our dataset made predictions with too much error. Even though this shape looks _familiar_, it's just not any kind of growth we've seen before.

Exponential growth started really _slowly_, and then suddenly shot up like a rocket to numbers so large we can't even reason about them. This kind of growth feels like the exact opposite, growing really _quickly_ but then leveling off to something very slow.

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/covid-graph.png, 375}}Let's think back to the graph of our model for Covid spread, from @lesson-link{exploring-exponential-models}.

- Our model answers the question "how many positive cases do we predict after @math{x} days?"
- The graph is showing us the relationship from +
_days → cases_, _x → y_, or _Domain → Range_.

But what if we want to answer the _opposite_ question: "how many days will it take to reach @math{y} cases?"

- Now we want to *flip the relationship around*, asking for +
_cases → days_, _y → x_, or _Range → Domain_.
- What would *this* graph look like?

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/covid-graph.png, 350}}}

Swapping the x's and y's is like reflecting the graph across the diagonal, making the axes trade places and swapping the x- and y-values for point on the line. Let's do that with our Covid model...

@slidebreak

@right{@image{images/inverse-covid-graph.png, 350}}Swapping the x- and y-axes makes the graph _start_ with rapid growth, and then flatten out. Now we can answer those inverted questions!

- During the pandemic, our initial value was roughly 120,000 cases.
- By 150,000 cases, it was 75 days later.
- By 300,000 cases, it was 112 days later.
- By 400,000 cases, it was 122 days after.

@clear

This kind of growth is much easier to understand, and *much more alarming!* By switching the axes, we've given our brains a much better chance of understanding what was really happening.

@slidebreak

@ifslide{@right{@image{images/inverse-covid-graph.png, 375}}}But our inverted model isn't exponential at all. In fact, it looks a lot more like our Wealth-v-Lifespan data!

==== What kind of growth _is_ this?

@slidebreak

This kind of growth is called _logarithmic growth_. Logarithmic functions are closely related to exponential functions!

| @math{f(x) = 3^x}

| @math{f(2) = 3^2 = 9}
| @math{g(9) = log_3(9) = 2}

@QandA{
@Q{What will @math{f(4)} evaluate to?}
@A{@math{f(4) = 3^3 = 27}}
@Q{What will @math{g(27)} evaluate to?}
@A{@math{g(27) = log_3(27) = 3}}
}

@slidebreak

*"A logarithmic relationship looks exponential, if your @math{x}'s and @math{y}'s trade places!"*

By "reversing the question", logarithmic functions and exponential functions serve as inverses of one another:

- The inputs and outputs are reversed
- The Domain and Range are swapped
- The curve is reflected over @math{y=x}

| We know that exponential functions grow by _equal factors over the same interval_. We can describe their growth by calculating the @vocab{growth factor}: "what @math{y} is multiplied by" in order to produce the next value over a constant interval.
| Instead of multiplying @math{y} by a constant to find the next value, we need to _multiply the size of our x-interval_ by a constant (called the @vocab{base}) in order to get a constant growth in @math{y}!

@teacher{
The "Evaluating Logarithmic Expressions" page uses a phrasing that helps students read a logarithmic expression from left-to-right, emphasizing readability.

=== Investigate

Logarithmic Functions can be written in the form: @math{f(x) = a \log_b(x-h) + k}

Most textbooks only present logarithmic functions with a horizontal shift of zero. When h=0, we can safely remove it and use this simplified form of the equation:

@center{@math{f(x) = a \log_b(x) + k}}

@teacher{
@opt{Advance your teacher dashboard of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos} to *Slide 3: How does h transform logarithmic functions?* and give your students a chance to reinforce their understanding of @math{h-values} from other models by connecting it to logarithmic functions.

@lesson-instruction{

}

@teacher{Have students share their answers. Be especially attentive to students who mis-label logarithmic relationships as "exponential" -- the relationship between the two is extremely subtle!}

@slidebreak

Most math books, Desmos, calculators, and programming languages offer a simple "log" function that doesn't specify a base. By convention, if the base isn't specified, _it's assumed to be base-10_. Pyret's `log` function works the same way:

@center{`log(1000) # returns 3, because 10^3 = 1000`}

If you want to work with a different base, you can look up Pyret's `log-base` function in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, contracts pages}.

@slidebreak

==== Vertical Shift @math{k}

The term @math{k} is the vertical shift of the function, which moves the curve up or down.

Since @math{log_{anything}(1) = 0}, the value of a standard log model at @math{x=1} will always be @math{0 + k}.

(_We've seen vertical shifts in other kinds of functions given different names, like @math{b} for linear functions._)

@slidebreak

==== Logarithmic Coefficient @math{a}

The term @math{a} is called the logarithmic coefficient, which - like @math{b} - helps determine how quickly the function grows.

@QandA{
@Q{What do you remember about the asymptote of a function with exponential growth?}
@A{It's horizontal at @math{k}, where @math{y} grows or shrinks by smaller and smaller amounts approaching zero}
}

Functions with logarithmic growth have a *vertical asymptote* where the function gets closer and closer, but never crosses the line.

@teacher{In this data exploration, the @vocab{asymptote} will always be located on the y-axis (@math{x = 0}).

Extremely observant students may notice that there's a relationship between @math{a} and @math{b}, where the value of @math{2 \log_{10}(10) = \log_{10}(10^2)}!}


=== Synthesize
- What _similarities_ do you see between exponential and logarithmic functions?

== Fitting by Changing Scale @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover that when a logarithmic relationship is graphed on an _exponential_ scale, the point cloud appears linear. When trying to use linear regression with those points, however, they are reminded that merely changing the scale of a graph does not actually change the data.

This section builds the foundation for _linearization_, transforming the points themselves, which students will do in the following section. (Note: this also opens the door for teaching inverse functions!)

=== Launch

@teacher{Sync or pace students to *Slide 5: Wealth-v-Health (Logarithmic)* of @starter-file{alg2-log-desmos}.}

@A{Record different students' responses for @math{a} and @math{c} on the board.}
@Q{How do your @math{a} and @math{c} values compare with those of other students'? Are they very similar or very different?}
@Q{What were the @math{S} values for these models?}
}

@slidebreak

Trial-and-error only gets us so far, and it's not clear that we would ever stumble upon the optimal model. 

*We need something like Pyret's `lr-plot`, which uses computational methods to find the optimal model.*

Unfortunately, `lr-plot` only finds _linear_ models in data with _linear_ relationships.

Data Scientists often use transformations to stretch their data into shapes that are easier to work with, and then reverse the transformation when they are done. If only we could _transform_ this data to make it appear linear. Then we could use `lr-plot` to fit the optimal model, and then reverse the transformation to get the optimal logarithmic model!

=== Investigate

@lesson-instruction{
- Imagine that the scatter plot is printed on a sheet of rubber, and can be stretched or squashed in any way we want... 
- With that image in mind, follow the directions on the last section of @printable-exercise{changing-scale.adoc}.
}

@teacher{Students will be switching the x-axis of their graph from linear to logarithmic in this section. Make sure they are toggling back and forth between the two views as they look for the best-fitting model.}

@slidebreak

@QandA{
@Q{A person running on a treadmill doesn't change location. Why not?}
@A{Their forward movement is balanced by the backwards movement of the treadmill.}
@Q{If they run faster and faster, what needs to happen to the treadmill to keep them in the same place?}
@A{The treadmill needs to go faster as well. As long as the treadmill speed increases at the same rate as the runner, they will balance one another's growth.}
@Q{How is the treadmill example comparable to what we've done with our x-axis transformation?}
@A{We are speeding up the growth intervals on the x-axis to "keep up with" the speed of growth in the data so that we can see the pattern better.}
}

When we changed Desmos's view from "Linear" to "Logarithmic", we made the x-axis grow faster and "squish" the dots so they appear linear. By _transforming the x-axis_ to grow exponentially, we are squashing the coordinate plane so that each interval on the x-axis represents 10x the growth in `pc-gdp` as the one before it. This balances out the logarithmic growth in `median-lifespan`, and warps our logarithmic model so the curved looks like linear.


@strategy{Going Deeper: Connecting to Inverse Functions}{

While this metaphor doesn't cover inverses in any real depth, the treadmill analogy opens the door to discussing how one kind of change can "cancel out" or "undo" another. 

We are working to add additional material on inverse functions to our Algebra 2 materials, and hope to release them in the coming year!
}

=== Synthesize

- How does seeing the point cloud as linear help us think about logarithmic growth?
- Transforming the axes only makes things _look_ linear - the actual points haven't changed at all, and we still can't use linear regression to find the best logarithmic model... Can you think of a way we could transform the _data_, instead of the axes?

== Fitting by Transforming Data @duration{45 minutes}

=== Overview

Having discovered that changing the scale of a graph allows us to _see_ logarithmic growth as linear, but still doesn't allow us to _treat_ it as linear, students learn to *transform the data* by applying a function to each row and building a new column that can be fit with a linear model. By applying the _inverse_ of this transformation to their computed linear model, students can derive the optimal logarithmic model.

=== Launch

We tried changing the scale on the x-axis from linear to logarithmic, which cancels out the logarithmic behavior by _shrinking the x-axis_ to make intervals that grow exponentially. Exponentially-bigger intervals on the x-axis cancel out the logarithmic growth on the y-axis, by squishing the points to appear linear.

@slidebreak

Unfortunately, this transformation is only skin-deep: the underlying data is still logarithmic, which makes it impossible for us to use linear regression to obtain an optimal model.

Another strategy is to *shrink the data*, by *transforming the x-coordinates themselves*. Instead of plotting `pc-gdp` on a logarithmic x-axis, we could plot `log(pc-gdp)` on a _linear_ one.

@slidebreak
@QandA{
@Q{How was transforming the data similar to changing the scale on the x-axis?}
@A{Transforming the data and changing the scale both made the logarithmic relationship look linear.}
@Q{How was it different?}
@A{Changing the scale just made things *look* linear, but the data wasn't any different so we still couldn't use linear regression on it.}
}

@slidebreak

Transforming the points instead of the axis has the same visual effect: the dots appear to fall in a straight line. But now we can plot them on a linear-scale axis, and use linear regression to find the best-possible model!

This transformation changed the _kind of growth_ from logarithmic to linear: instead of increasing logarithmically by @math{a}, our new function increases _linearly_ by @math{a}.

The term went from @math{a \log_{10}(x)} to @math{ax}, turning our logarithmic coefficient into..._*slope*_.

=== Investigate

We transformed the `pc-gdp` column in three steps:

1. We defined a transformation function, @math{g(x)}, which produces the log of whatever it's given (the `pc-gdp` column).
2. We defined a new column to use as our x-values, populating it by applying the transformation to each of our original x-values.
3. We displayed these transformed datapoints as a scatter plot.

If we can do this in Pyret, *we could run linear regression on the transformed data*, and then use what we know about the coefficients to *turn our optimal linear model into an optimal _logarithmic_ one!*

@strategy{Optional Activity: Guess the Model!}{

1. Divide students into teams of 2-4, and have each team come up with a logarithmic, real-world scenario, then have them write down a logarithmic function that fits this scenario on a sticky note. Make sure no one else can see the function!
2. On the board or some flip-chart paper, have each team draw a _scatter plot_ for which their logarithmic function is best fit. They should only draw the point cloud - _not the function itself!_ Finally, students title display to describe their real-world scenario (e.g. - "Age of a Person from Birth to 16 vs. Number of Cells in their Body").
3. Have teams switch places or rotate, so that each team is in front of another team's scatter plot. Have them figure out the original function, write their best guess on a sticky note, and stick it next to the scatter plot.
4. Have teams return to their original scatter plot, and look at the model their colleagues guessed. How close were they? What strategies did the class use to figure out the model?

- The coefficients can be constrained to make the activity easier or harder. For example, limiting these coefficients to whole numbers, positive numbers, etc.
- To extend the activity, have the teams continue rotating so that each group adds their sticky note for the best-guess model. Then do a gallery walk so that students can reflect: were the models all pretty close? All over the place? Were the guesses for one coefficient grouped more tightly than the guesses for another?

- Why is the @vocab{S-value} for our logarithmic model the same as the @vocab{S-value} for our linear model after transforming?
- Why were our coefficients for linear and logarithmic models the same, even though they were for different terms?
- Why do you think the relationship between wealth and median lifespan is logarithmic?
- Suppose all the tech companies in the Bay Area (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.) decided to secede and form their own country with a `pc-gdp` far, far beyond the range of the rest of the data. Would it be appropriate to use our model to predict the `median-lifespan` for their employees? Why or why not?

@teacher{
We are working on collecting more datasets that can be modeled with logarithmic functions so that we can offer students more practice with using linear regression to build logarithmic models.
