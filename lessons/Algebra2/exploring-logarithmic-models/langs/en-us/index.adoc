=== Overview
Students explore the @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1SGzPWywGy63-DaqOVTy39-497lcWaF4B, Countries of the World Starter File}, and find a relationship between wealth and median life expectancy. They also learn how to build a new column for a table in Pyret.

=== Investigate

Discuss students' findings. Pay special attention to the @vocab{form} that students use to describe the pattern in the scatter plot. Is it linear, or something else? Is it strong or weak? If there's some disagreement among the students, that's a good thing!

[.lesson-instruction]
Working in pairs or small groups, complete the rest of @printable-exercise{exploring-countries.adoc}.

Note: This worksheet involves lots of trial and error, as students try to come up with a good linear model. The goal is to __discover that a non-linear model is necessary__.

=== Synthesize

- Have students discuss their findings. What's the best model they came up with?
- Have students share the sketches they drew. What kinds of lines or curves did they use?


== Fitting Logarithmic Models @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students try to fit different models to a logarithmic relationship, discovering their limitations. They then fit a logarithmic model to the data, and then try transforming that data using log functions.

=== Launch

@center{@image{images/wealth-v-life-linear.png}}

There definitely appears to be a relationship here, but it's not linear. Using `lr-plot` only shows a moderate correlation, because the straight line doesn't really fit the curve. The shape of this starts out rising fast on the left, before tapering off as `pc-gdp` increases to the right. What functions behave like this?

=== Investigate

The shape of this relationship is _logarithmic_, meaning it can be modeled using a logarithmic function:

@center{   @math{f(x) = b \times log(x) + c}    }

We need to find @math{b} and @math{c}, such that the model fits the data as closely as possible.

Pyret has a few functions that may come in handy here:

Note: This process involves a lot of trial and error, as students build up an intuition for how the terms in a logarithmic graph affect the graph of the function. This mirrors the process students went through in @lesson-link{exploring-linear-models}.

=== Synthesize

- What was the best @math{R^2} value you found?
- What points did you use?
- What, if any, other strategies did you use to come up with your model?

== Using Log Transformations @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview

Students learn to transform the data into a linear shape, building a new column by applying a function to each row. This new data can be fit with a linear model. By applying the _inverse_ of this transformation to their linear model, they retrieve the quadratic model.

=== Launch

Deriving a logarithmic model from only two points is problematic. How do we know that those two points are representative of the trend? If we picked a wealthy country that is at war, we'd find an artificially low life expectancy. A model based on that point would probably not fit the rest of the points very well!

This is the same problem we ran into with linear models in our state demographics data, where a model built from any two points would only be as good as those points were representative.

Trial-and-error only gets us so far, and it's not clear that we would ever stumble upon the optimal model. We need something like Pyret's `lr-plot` function, which uses computational methods to find the best possible model. Unfortunately, `lr-plot` only finds linear models. We need to find a transformation that will make this data appear linear in order to use `lr-plot`.

Imagine that the scatter plot is printed on a sheet of rubber, and can be stretched or squished in any way we want. Data Scientists often use *transformations* to stretch their data into shapes that are easier to use, and then reverse the transformation when they are done.

- What does the `build-column` function do?
- How is `albania["pc-gdp"] / 2` similar to `transform-pc-gdp(albania)`? How are they different?
** __Similar: Both result in dividing the `pc-gdp` of Albania by two.__
** __Different: The first looks up the `pc-gdp` column of `albania` and divides it by two, while the second _applies a function_ to `albania` which does that same work.__

Given a table, a string and a function, `build-column` creates a new table with an extra column. The given string determines the header of the column, and the given function computes the values in that column based on each row of the old table. In this worksheet, `build-column` is used to add a column called `pc-gdp / 2` to the `countries-table`, by applying `transform-pc-gdp` to each Row.

Now we can look for a relationship between `pc-gdp / 2` and `median-lifespan`.

Our goal in transforming this dataset is to find a transformation that lets us use the power of linear regression to compute the best-possible model. Once we've done that, we'll __transform the model itself__ and use the transformed model with our original dataset.

=== Investigate

Since the values on the y-axis (`median-lifespan`) appear to grow logarithmically, we could _transform_ the x-axis (`pc-gdp`) to grow logarithmically as well. With both x- and y-values growing logarithmically, they would appear grow at a constant rate relative to one another. A constant rate will appear linear, which allows us to use `lr-plot` to find the optimal model!

How can we transform this plot so that the `pc-gdp` column is placed on a logarithmic scale?

Success! After transforming the `pc-gdp` column to `log-pc-gdp`, a scatter plot shows a more linear pattern in the data! Pyret's `lr-plot` tool computes the best possible linear model for our transformed data, determining it to have a slope of `5.169` and a y-intercept of `24.264`. Our @math{R^2} has jumped to 0.663, showing a vastly better correlation than before.

@clear

With the transformation applied, our linear model (in both function and Pyret notation) is:

- @math{f(x) = 5.169x + 24.264}
- @show{(code '(define (f x) (+ (* 5.169 x) 24.264)))}

At each point in our linear model, @math{f} is the _predicted median lifespan_, and @math{x} is the _log of per-capita gdp_. But we want @math{x} to represent the **original, un-transformed** value, simply using _per-capita gdp_ as-is.

Instead of transforming our dataset and then fitting a linear model, we want to transform _the model itself_ and then fit it to the original dataset. We already know the translation requires taking the log of `per-capita-gdp`, so we can simply compose our linear function with a log function:

- @math{g(x) = f(log(x))}
- @show{(code '(define (g x) (f (log x))))}

Of course, we could also just define a new function which composes the log transformation with our linear function, by replacing @math{x} in our linear model with @math{log(x)}:

- @math{h(x) = 5.169 \times log(x) + 24.264}
- @show{(code '(define (h x) (+ (* 5.169 (log x)) 24.264)))}

The resulting logarithmic model can be fit to our original scatter plot, showing a much better fit than our 2-point-derived estimates.

=== Synthesize

- Why is the @math{R^2} value for our logarithmic model the same as the value for our linear model after transforming?
- How do you interpret this model?
- Why do you think the relationship between wealth is logarithmic?
- Are there other relationships you can think of, which might be logarithmic?

== Additional Exercises

Is the relationship between wealth and lifespan different in countries that have universal healthcare? Students can explore this in @opt-printable-exercise{transforming-wealth-practice.adoc}.
