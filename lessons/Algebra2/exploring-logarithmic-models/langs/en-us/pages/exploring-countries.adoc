For this section, you'll need the  @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you. The columns in this dataset are described below:

[.columnInfo, cols="5a,6a", grid=none, frame=none, stripes=none]
|===
|
- *country* - name of the country
- *gdp* - total gross domestic product of the country
- *population* - number of people in the country
|
- *pc-gdp* - "per-capita gdp": the average GDP _per-person_
- *has-univ-healthcare* - indicates if the country has universal healthcare
- *median-lifespan* - the median life expectancy of people in the country
|===

@n Do you think you see a relationship? If so, describe it. Is it linear or nonlinear? Strong or weak?

== Fitting Models

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, you'll need to have *Fitting Wealth-v-Health and Exploring Logarithmic Models (Desmos)* open on your computer.

For each question below: (1) explore in Desmos (2) define and fit your model in Pyret (the starter file already contains sample functions for you to change, called `linear1`, `quadratic1`, and `exponential1`!). Then write the model and the @math{S}.

@n Find the best *linear model* you can, using the first slide in the Desmos activity or `lr-plot` in the @starter-file{alg2-countries}.

[cols="5a,1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===

@hspace{3em}@math{f(x) =} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{@math{0.00021}}}{slope (m)}x + @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{68.0125}}{y-intercept (b)}
|
@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{5.93}}{S-value}
|===

@n Find the best *quadratic model* you can, using the second slide _(Wealth-v-Health Quadratic)_ in the Desmos activity.

[cols="5a,1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
@hspace{3em}@math{f(x) = }@fitbruby{10em}{}{quadratic coefficient (a)}@math{(x âˆ’}@fitbruby{10em}{}{vertex (h)}@math{)^2 +}@fitbruby{10em}{}{vertical shift (k)}
|
@fitbruby{10em}{}{S-value}
|===

@n Find the best *exponential model* you can, using the third slide _(Wealth-v-Health Exponential)_ in the Desmos activity.

[cols="5a,1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
@hspace{3em}@math{f(x) = }@fitbruby{10em}{}{initial value (a)}@math{(}@fitbruby{10em}{}{growth factor (b)}@math{^x) + } @fitbruby{10em}{}{vertical shift (k)}
|
@fitbruby{10em}{}{S-value}
|===

@n Are any of these models a good fit for this data? Why or why not?
