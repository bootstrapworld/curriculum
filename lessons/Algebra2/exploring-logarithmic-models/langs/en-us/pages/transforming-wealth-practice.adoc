Does the relationship between wealth and median lifespan look different in countries with universal healthcare than it does in countries without?

@vspace{1ex}

Read the function below carefully:

`fun no-universal(r): not(r["has-univ-healthcare"]) end`

@n What do you think this function does? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{it looks up the value of the `has-univ-healthcare`}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{column in whatever row it was passed and produces the opposite.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@center{**Add the code for this function at the bottom of the Definitions Area, then click Run.**}

@n What does @show{(code '(no-universal albania))} evaluate to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`true`}}

@vspace{1ex}

@center{**At the bottom of the Definitions Area, type `countries-wo-univ = filter(countries2, no-universal)`, then click Run.**}

@n What does `countries-wo-univ` produce? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table of all the countries without universal healthcare}}

@fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

@center{**In the Definitions Area, define a new function called `yes-universal`**, which returns the value in the `has-univ-healthcare` column. Then use it with the `filter` function to **define a new table called `countries-w-univ`**.}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Use the transformed column `log-pc-gdp` in each of the two tables to find the best possible linear model with `lr-plot`, then use these results to create logarithmic models. Fill in the table below.

@n Try using `fit-model` with your new models, fitting it to the original, un-transformed `countries-w-univ` and `countries-wo-univ` tables. For which table was the relationship _strongest?_ @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Countries without universal healthcare}}

@n What does this mean about the impact of universal healthcare?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{the relationship between wealth and lifespan is slightly stronger in countries without universal healthcare (0.76222 v. 0.66702),}}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{and in countries with universal healthcare, the wealth of the pc-gdp has a larger impact on lifespan than in countries without}}
