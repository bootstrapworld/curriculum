For this page, you'll need the @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer. __If you haven't already__, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Read the function definition carefully: `fun no-universal(r): not(r["has-univ-healthcare"]) end`

@hspace{3em} What do you think this function does? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{it looks up the value of the `has-univ-healthcare`}}

@hspace{3em}@fitb{}{@ifsoln{column in whatever row it was passed and produces the opposite.}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Add `fun no-universal(r): not(r["has-univ-healthcare"]) end` at the bottom of the Definitions Area. 

@vspace{1ex}

@hspace{3em} Click "Run" and evaluate @show{(code '(no-universal albania))} in the Interactions Area. 

@hspace{3em} What does Pyret return? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`true`}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Add `countries-wo-univ = filter(countries2, no-universal)` to the bottom of the Definitions Area, then click "Run".

@hspace{3em}What does evaluating `countries-wo-univ` in the Interactions Area produce? @fitb{}{}

@hspace{3em} @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A table of all the countries without universal healthcare}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Using the two definitions you just added as models:

[.indentedpara]
- Define a new function called `yes-universal`, which returns the value in the `has-univ-healthcare` column. 
- Define a new table called `countries-w-univ`, which shows all the countries with universal healthcare.
- Click "Run" to load these new definitions once you have them both typed into the Definitions Area.

@n Fill in the table below by:

[.indentedpara]
- Building an `lr-plot` for each of these tables with the transformed-column `log-pc-gdp`.
- Using what you learn from `lr-plot` to write logarithmic models for each table.
- Using `fit-model` to find @math{R^2} for each of your logarithmic models and their corresponding un-transformed `countries-w-univ` and `countries-wo-univ` tables.
