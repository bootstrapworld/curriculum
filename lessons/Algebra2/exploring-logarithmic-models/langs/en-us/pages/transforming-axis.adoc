* This includes some inline CSS which loads the Desmos font,
* which includes special glyphs used for icons on Desmos.com
*
* It also defines the classname '.desmosbutton', which is used
* to style all demos glphys
*
* Finally, it defines AsciiDoc variables for glyphs we use:
* {points}
* {caret}
* {magnifying}
* {wrench}

* Here's an example of using these:
* This is a wrench icon in desmos: [.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#

== Fitting a Logarithmic Model

**Open the `Data Table` folder by clicking on the triangle ({FOO})**

@vspace{1ex}

@math{x_1} is the per-capita income for each country, and @math{y_1} is the median lifespan. The spotted circle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#) next to @math{y_1} means that those points are visible on our graph.

@n Click the dots ([.desmosbutton]#{points}#) to "turn them off", then click them again to turn them back on.

@n Move the graph by clicking and dragging the background. A magnifying glass ([.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}#) appears to the bottom left of the table. What does clicking on the magnifying glass do? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{it resizes/rescales the graph to fit all the points in the table}}

@n Look at the numbers along the x-axis, which increase as they go from left to right. Is this pattern linear, quadratic, exponential, or something else? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{linear}}

@n Look at the number that is the farthest to the right of your screen. What do you think the next number will be? @fitb{}{}

@n Can you _describe_ the pattern? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the numbers increase, *adding* a constant factor}}

@n Move the sliders for @math{b} and @math{c} to create the best-fitting logarithmic model you can find, and write it below.

[cols="^1a", grid="none", frame="none", stripes="none"]

@math{f(x) = }@fitbruby{10em}{}{growth factor (b)}@math{\times ln(x) + }@fitbruby{10em}{}{vertical shift (c)}
|===

@n In Pyret, modify `f(x)` to define this model, and fit it using the `fit-model` function. What is your @math{R^2}? @fitb{}{}

== Transforming the x-Axis

**Open the "Graph Settings" window in Desmos** by clicking on the wrench button ([.desmosbutton]#{wrench}#) in the top-right corner of the graph.

**Expand the "More Options" section** by clicking the triangle ([.desmosbutton]#{caret}#).

**Change the x-axis scale** from `Linear` to `Logarithmic`.

@n Look at the numbers along the _transformed_ x-axis, which increase as they go from left to right. Would you describe this pattern as linear, quadratic, exponential, or something else? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{linear}}

@n Look at the number that is the farthest to the right of your screen. What do you think the next number will be? @fitb{5em}{} Can you describe the pattern? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{the numbers increase, *multiplying* by a constant factor}}

If your axes have shifted, **click the magnifying glass** [.desmosbutton]#{magnifying}# to put the points back into view.

@n What is the shape of the point cloud _now?_ Is it linear? Quadratic? Exponential? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It's linear!}}

@n What has changed about the predictor line for the logarithmic model you graphed? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{It looks like a straight line!}}

@n Why did transforming the *x-axis* make our data look linear? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n From your logarithmic model above, copy your values for growth factor (@math{b}) and vertical shift (@math{c})
