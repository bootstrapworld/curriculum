For this page, you'll need the @starter-file{alg2-countries} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

**We started with a model based on Afghanistan and Albania. We can interpret the slope and @math{R^2} value below:**

__The @fitbruby{20em}{Afghanistan-Albania}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{dollar}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{5.169 **}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. Based on the @math{R^2} of @fitbruby{10em}{-15.63}{R^2^ value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{really, really poorly}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}.__

@n Describe the optimal model YOU created via linear regression:

__The @fitbruby{20em}{linear-regression}{sensible name} model predicts that a 1 @fitbruby{10em}{percent}{[x-axis units]} increase in @fitbruby{20em}{percent college degrees}{[x-axis]} is associated with a @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{1142 dollar}}{[slope, y-units]} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{20em}{median household income}{[y-axis]}. With an @math{R^2} of @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{.585}}{R^2^ value}, this model fits @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{pretty well}}{really well, decently, poorly, etc.}.__

@n Does each additional dollar of per-capita gdp provide an equal boost in lifespan? Why or why not? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{No. Log functions grow by smaller and smaller amount as x increases}}
