For this page, you'll need to have *Slide 2: Exploring Exponential Models* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* open on your computer. +
The curve you'll see is the graph of @math{h(x) = 2^x}. Another curve @math{f(x)} is hiding behind it. +
For starters, the values of the coefficients of @math{f(x)} have been set to make it equivalent to @math{h(x)} so @math{k=0}, @math{b=2} and @math{a=1}

== Base @math{b}
@n Make sure @math{k = 0} and @math{a=1}. Experiment with @math{b}. *For what values of @math{b} is the function _undefined_?* (the line will disappear)? @fitb{}{negative}

@n Keeping @math{a=1} and @math{k=0}, change @math{b} to 0.5, 1, and 2, graphing each curve below. For each curve, *label the coordinates at x=1, 2, and 3.*

@n What does @math{b} tell us about an exponential function, when @math{b} is *greater than 1*? @fitb{}{_How quickly the function grows_ - } +

@fitb{}{_literally the multiplier that says how quickly the growth intervals change_}

@n What does @math{b} tell us about an exponential function, when @math{b} is *less than 1*? @fitb{}{_How quickly the function decays_ - } +

@fitb{}{literally the multiplier that says how quickly the decay intervals change}

== Vertical Shift...and Horizontal Asymptote @math{k}
@n Keeping @math{a=1} and @math{b=2}, try changing the value of @math{k} to -10, 0, and 10, graphing each curve in the squares below. For each curve, find and label the y-value where the curve is "most horizontal", then *draw a horizontal line at that y-value*.

@n What does @math{k} tell us about an exponential function? @fitb{}{_How far the parabola is shifted up (positive k) or down (negative k),_} +
@fitb{}{_and where the curve levels out_}

== Initial Value @math{a}
@n Set @math{k=0} and @math{b=2}. Change the value of @math{a} to 10, 2, and -5, graphing each curve in the squares below. *For each curve, label the y-intercept (x=0).*
