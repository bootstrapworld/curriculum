== Filtering {amp} Simpson's Paradox @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the @starter-file{alg2-covid}, and discover that some scatter plots show __multiple__ trends instead of just one! This motivates a brief discussion of Simpson's Paradox, and teaches them to filter their dataset into grouped samples.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open the @starter-file{alg2-covid}
- From the File menu, select "Save a Copy", and click "Run"
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete questions 1-10 of @printable-exercise{exploring-covid.adoc}

@center{@image{images/multiple-models.png}}

The scatterplot we just produced doesn't look much like a scatterplot all! It looks like someone took a blue marker and drew in five different curvy lines. While it's clear that there are strong patterns in the data, these patterns are so distinct from one another that there isn't really one, single model that fits them all. Each relationship appears very strong, almost as if there is _more than one model_ here.

Review student answers to confirm that students have made a number of observations:

* There is _more than one_ relationship in this dataset
* Every relationship seems extremely strong
* Most/all relationships appear non-linear

=== Investigate

With all these clear, tight lines, we might think this would be a dataset with a very strong correlation. Unfortunately, that's not true at all.

Datasets like these are impossible to model all at once, because there will always be lots of points that are far from any single function. But it's not that there's _no correlation_. Instead, we have several sub-groups each with their own _very strong correlations._

[.lesson-point]
Simpson's Paradox: visible trends in sub-groups _disappear_ or even _reverse_ when the groups are combined.

Normally we think that "more data means more power!", and that the more data we include in our sample the more clearly we'll see any potential correlations. But in certain circumstances - like in our Covid dataset - the correlations in our sub-groups cancel each other out when we put the groups together. This is called Simpson's Paradox, and you can learn more at @link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox, Wikipedia}.

**For Example:** School A and B both have basketball teams. The 6 foot kids on School A's team are better than the 6 foot kids on School B's team. The 5' 10" kids from School A are also better than 5' 10" kids from School B. In fact, at every height, the kids from School A are better than the kids from School B. __But School B's team is better than School A.__ How is this possible? School B has __more tall kids__ than School A!

[.lesson-instruction]
- We need to break this dataset up into _grouped samples_, so that all of the data for Rhode Island is in one table, all of the data for Maine is in another, etc.
- Working in pairs or small groups, complete the rest of of @printable-exercise{exploring-covid.adoc}.

How does the `filter` function work?

__The `filter` function consumes a Table and **a helper function!** The helper function is used on every Row of the Table, producing true or false. The `filter` function takes all the Rows for which the helper produced true, and combines them all into a new table.__

@span{.title}{More Practice with Filtering}

While filtering is introduced in this lesson, the primary goal is about exponential functions. If your students need more practice with filtering - or wish to filter their own datasets - we recommend checking out the @lesson-link{table-functions} lesson.
|===

We can use `filter` to split our dataset into multiple sub-groups, and then fit models to each sample.

[.lesson-instruction]
Create helper functions to filter at least three other states, then use them to define the Covid tables for each state.

=== Common Misconceptions

It's extremely common for students to think that filtering a table *changes the original table*. This is NOT how it works in Pyret! Instead, the `filter` function always produces a _new_ table, containing only the Rows for which the supplied function evaluates to `true`

=== Synthesize
- In what other situations would it be useful to filter a dataset?
- Can you think of other examples where Simpson's Paradox might arise?


== Looking for Patterns @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview

Students explore their newly-filtered `MA-covid` dataset, trying to fit different kinds of models to it. This section makes heavy use of @link{https://www.Desmos.com, Desmos}, which is an excellent tool for open-ended experimentation.

=== Launch

Make a scatter-plot showing the Covid infection rate for Massachusetts. What kind of model do you think would fit this best?

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{linear-models.adoc}, using @starter-file{alg2-covid-desmos-l}.

Linear models capture _straight-line relationships_, where one quantity varies proportionally based on another. In linear models, we expect the response variable to grow by equal amounts over equal intervals in the explanatory variable.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Class discussion: Are linear models a good fit for this data? Why or why not?

@right{@image{images/MA-covid-linear.png, 300}} If we make the line go from the start to the peak, almost all of the points bulge out below out line of best fit. If we make the line fit the bulge, all the points fall above it. We always have either too many points _below_ the line in the middle or _above_ the line at the end. **It's growing too fast to be fit with a linear model that grows at a constant rate!**

[.lesson-instruction]
- Complete @printable-exercise{quadratic-models.adoc}, using @starter-file{alg2-covid-desmos-q}.

Quadratic models capture _parabolic relationships_, where one quantity varies based on the square of another. In quadratic models, we expect the response variable to grow by differing amounts over equal intervals in the explanatory variable.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Class discussion: Are quadratic models a good fit for this data? Why or why not?

Have students share their resulting models. Which one fits best?

@right{@image{images/MA-covid-quadratic.png, 300}} Quadratic models change their rate of growth over time, which definitely makes them a better fit for this data than linear ones. But they still don't have the explosive growth we need to model this data, which starts out incredibly slow and then suddenly takes off like a rocket.

=== Synthesize

- Do you think the data for MA shows a linear relationship? Why or why not?
- Do you think this data shows a quadratic relationship? Why or why not?
- Do you think this data shows some other kind of relationship? Why or why not?

== Fitting Exponential Models @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

Students are introduced to exponential models, and extend their sampling techniques to exponential relationships. Students continue experimenting in Desmos, but eventually switch back to Pyret to formalize their understanding.

=== Launch

There is, however, a class of functions that grow even faster than quadratics: *exponential functions*.

[.lesson-point]
Linear functions grow by equal *amounts* over equal intervals (adding _n_ each time). Exponential functions grow by equal *factors* over equal intervals (multiplying by _n_ each time).

Exponential relationships show up all the time!

- Cells that constantly divide, doubling the total number of cells each time
- A tree that's on fire will likely catch neighboring trees on fire, so that the fire spreads to 2 or more trees each time
- Money in a savings account grows by a certain percentage each year, meaning every year there's that much more money to grow


[.lesson-instruction]
Can you think of other real-world examples where a relationship is likely exponential?

Exponential models have the form @math{y = ab^x + k}

- @math{k} is the vertical shift, which is the amount the graph is shifted up or down the y-axis. @math{k} contributes the same amount to the value of the function for all values of @math{x}
- @math{a} is the initial value, which is the contribution of the exponential term when @math{x} is zero. Another way to think of it is "the value of the function _above k_ when @math{x} is zero"
- @math{b} is a growth factor, which is the rate at which the exponential term grows (@math{b > 1}) or decays (@math{b < 1}) as @math{x} increases.

=== Investigate

Now we need to figure out the values of @math{a}, @math{b} and @math{k} for this data.

@span{.title}{Going Deeper: Polynomial Models}

For students who are farther along, we recommending showing them _all_ the data through 2020, starting in January rather than June. The first portion of the infection curve shows a gradual, linear growth pattern before exploding in the Fall of 2020. This is _polynomial_ behavior, where a linear term dominates when the exponential term is small.

We have _artificially constrained this dataset_, showing only the data from June 9th to December 26th, 2020. We've made this choice in order to showcase the most purely-exponential behavior of the infection curve, for the sake of this lessons' math learning goals.

Based on the strength of your students, we encourage you to choose the data that best fits your learning goals.
|===

@star Optional: have students build models for other states. How do the coefficients differ from state to state? What differences between states could explain the different values of the coefficients?

=== Synthesize

- What makes exponential models different from the linear and quadratic models you've seen before?
- How would you describe the shape of the three models you've seen so far (Linear, Quadratic, and Exponential)?
