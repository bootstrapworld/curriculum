== Fitting the Model Visually @math{f(x) = ab^x + k}

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, you'll need to have *Slide 3: Exploring Exponential Models* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* open on your computer.

@n Try changing the value of @math{k}, then @math{a}, then @math{b} to find three promising exponential models, graphing each one and labeling your values on the grids below.

== Fitting the Model Programmatically @math{f(x) = ab^x + k}

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, open your copy of the @starter-file{alg2-covid}.

@n In the space below, define `exponential` for one of the models you fit in Desmos.

@ifsoln{@vspace{1ex}}

@ifsoln{*Answers will vary.* If @math{a = 31.6}, @math{b = 1.047} and @math{k = 119000}, you would get the following:}

`fun exponential(x): (` @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{31.6}}{a} `* num-expt(` @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{1.047}}{b} `, (~1 * x))) +` @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{119000}}{k} `end`

@indented{
_Two Notes on this function definition:_

* `num-expt` _is the function that we use for exponents. It takes in 2 numbers: the base and the power, in this case @math{b} and @math{x}._
* _At first it may appear that @math{x} is being multiplied by negative 1 (`-1`), when it is actually being multiplied by `*~1*` (literally the value "roughly 1"). This tells Pyret to round off the calculation, prioritizing *speed* over *precision* to get a result that is "roughly accurate". We've added this to the function definition so that you won't have to wait for several minutes for Pyret to run `fit-model` to get an answer for question 4._
}
@n Update the definition for `exponential` in the Definitions Area and click "Run" to reload it.

@n Use `fit-model` to determine how closely `exponential` fits the `MA-table`. @hspace{5em} @math{S = } @fitb{@ifsoln{5em}}{@ifsoln{@math{13,373.83} for the above example}} +
@ifsoln{*Answer will vary.*} _Hint: If you forgot the contract for `fit-model`, look it up in the @dist-link{Contracts.shtml, contracts pages}!_



@n Are exponential models a good fit for this data? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +

@star Rewrite the model to make Pyret do these calculations with extreme precision. @hspace{1em} (Remove the part where it multiplies by `~1` .) +
_WARNING: Be sure to save your work first, as there's a good chance this will lock up your browser and require force-quitting!_

Data scientists perform calculations to do things like send satellites to far-away planets, or analyze large populations of a billion or more. +
You know that the pros of using `~1` involve speed. *What are the potential downsides of using `~1` to speed up a calculation?*
