== Fitting the Model Visually @math{f(x) = ab^x + k}

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, you'll need to have *Slide 4: Exploring Exponential Models* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* open on your computer.

@n Try changing the value of @math{k}, then @math{a}, then @math{b} to find three promising exponential models, graphing each one and labeling your values on the grids below.

== Fitting the Model Programmatically @math{f(x) = ab^x + k}

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, open your copy of the @starter-file{alg2-covid}.

@n In the space below, define `exponential1` for one of the models you fit in Desmos.

@ifsoln{@vspace{1ex}}

@ifsoln{Answers will vary.}

@ifsoln{If @math{a=31.6}, @math{b=1.047} and @math{k=119000}, you would get the following:}

`fun exponential1(x): (` @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{31.6}}{a} `* num-expt(` @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{1.047}}{b} `, (~1 * x))) +` @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{119000}}{k} `end`

__Two Notes on this function definition:__

* `num-expt` __is the function that we use for exponents. It takes in 2 numbers: the base and the power, in this case @math{b} and @math{x}.__
* __At first it may appear that @math{x} is being multiplied by negative 1 (`-1`), when it is actually being multiplied by `*~1*` (literally the value "roughly 1"). This tells Pyret to round off the calculation, prioritizing *speed* over *precision* to get a result that is "roughly accurate". We've added this to the function definition so that you won't have to wait for several minutes for Pyret to run `fit-model` to get an answer for question 4.__

@n Type your definition into the Definitions Area.

@n Use `fit-model` to determine how closely `exponential1` fits the `MA-table`. @hspace{5em} @math{S = } @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Answer will vary.}}

@ifsoln{For reference, for the above example @math{S} is @math{13,373.83}}

@ifsoln{@vspace{1ex}}

@ifsoln{
- The code for this should be: `fit-model(MA-table, "state", "day", "positive", exponential1)`
}

@n Are exponential models a good fit for this data? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{}}

@star Rewrite the model so it doesn't multiply by `~1` to make Pyret do these calculations with extreme precision. WARNING: be sure to save your work first, as there's a good chance this will lock up your browser and require force-quitting! Data scientists perform calculations to do things like send satellites to far-away planets, or analyze large populations of a billion or more. You know the pros of using `~1` involve speed. What are the potential downsides of using `~1` to speed up a calculation?
