For this page, you'll need to have the @starter-file{alg2-covid} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@vspace{1ex}

**This starter file actually defines a table _just for MA data_, called `MA-table`: @show{(code '(define MA-table (filter covid-table is-MA)))}**

@n Find this definition in the starter file. In your own words, describe what you think this code does. @fitb{}{} +

| @n Make a scatter plot from `MA-table` showing the relationship between `day` and `positive`, using `state` as the labels. Sketch the plot on the right.

@n Do you see a correlation here? If so, describe its shape in your own words. @fitb{}{} +

@n What kind of model do you think would fit best? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{}

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the best-possible *linear model* for the MA Covid dataset, and write it below:

@center{f(x) = @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{@math{845.617x + 6.94e4}}}}
@center{@math{S =} @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{3.18e4}}}

@n Do you see an `e` in the linear model above? What does it mean?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{The y-intercept value is @math{6.94e4}. It's another way of writing @math{6.94 \times 10^4}, which is scientific notation for @math{69,400}.}}

@n In the @starter-file{alg2-covid}, change the definition of the `linear` function to match the model produced by `lr-plot`, then fit the model to confirm the @vocab{S-value}.

@n Would you feel good about making predictions based on this model? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +
