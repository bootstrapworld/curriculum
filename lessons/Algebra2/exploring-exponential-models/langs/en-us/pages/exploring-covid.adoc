@n Click "Run", and evaluate `covid-table` in the Interactions Area. 

@n Take a look at the Definitions area and find the "notes on columns". What is the start date for the data in this table? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{June 20, 2020}}

@n In the Definitions area we see rows defined for Connecticut: `CT1`, Massachusetts: `MA1` and Maine: `ME1`. What do we learn by evaluating `MA1` in the interactions area?

@fitb{}{@ifsoln{On Day 1 after June 20,2020 there were 104156 positive cases in Massachusetts.}}

@n Define three new Rows called `VT1`, `NH1` and `RI1` for Vermont, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Click "Run" and test them out.

| @n In Pyret, make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `day` and `positive`, using `state` as your labels, then sketch the resulting scatter plot below.

@n In which state did the number of cases grow _fastest_? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{MA}}

@n In which state did the number of cases grow _slowest_? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{VT}}

@n Are these strong or weak relationship(s)? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{strong}}

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the best-possible linear model for the relationship between `day` and `positive` in this dataset. 

What do you notice about the line? @fitb{}{} 

@fitb{}{}

@n What is the @math{R^2} value? @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{0.07983}} and what does it tell us about the model? @fitb{}{}

@fitb{}{}

@n Find the function called `is-MA` (under "Define some helper functions" in your Pyret file). Read them both carefully!

What is the *Domain* of `is-MA`? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{Row}} Its *Range*? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}

@n What do you _think_ @show{(code '(is-MA MA1))} will evalute to? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{true}}. @show{(code '(is-MA CT1))}? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{false}}. @show{(code '(is-MA ME1))}? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{false}}

@center{**Try typing each of these into the Interactions Area on the right. Were you correct?**}

@n Find `MA-table` in the Definitions Area (the first definition under "Define some grouped and/or random samples" in your Pyret file). What is that code doing? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Defining a new table called `MA-table`, which is all the rows from our original table where state is "MA"}}

@n Type `MA-Table` into the interactions area. What does it evaluate to? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{A Table just for data from Massachusetts}}

@star Following the model of `is-MA` and `MA-table`, define a new function `is-VT`, and use it to create a new grouped sample called `VT-table`.
