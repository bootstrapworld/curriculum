For this page, you'll need to the  @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1ueyf5-0ByVYmeJKQ03i9msb9u1C5y50o, Covid Spread Starter File} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select **Save a Copy** from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Click "Run", and evaluate `covid-table` in the Interactions Area. Do you know what each column means?

[cols="1a,1a,1a", frame="none", stripes="none"]
|===
| *day* - the number of days after February 20th, 2020
| *state* - the state reporting the data
| *positive* - the number of new, positive cases reported
|===

@n Evaluate `MA3`, `NH4` and `CT7` in the Interactions Area. Which states are represented by these rows? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{MA, CT, and NH}}

@n In the Definitions Area on the left, define new Rows for Maine (ME) and Vermont (VT). Click "Run" and test these Rows out in the Interactions Area.

| @n In Pyret, make a scatter plot showing the relationship between `day` and `positive`, using `state` as your labels, then sketch the resulting scatter plot below.

Based on the scatter plot...

@n What do you *Notice?* @fitb{}{} +

@n What do you *Wonder?* @fitb{}{} +

@fitb{}{}

@n In which state did covid spread the fastest? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{MA}}

@n In which state did covid spread the slowest? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{VT}}

@n Are these _strong_ relationship(s), or weak ones? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{strong}}

@n On line 21 you'll find a Contract for a new function. Read it carefully, along with the description of the function's purpose on line 22. What is the name of this function? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{is-MA}} Domain? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Row}} Range? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}

@n What do you think @show{(code '(is-MA MA3))} will evalute to? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{true}}. @show{(code '(is-MA NH4))}? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{false}}. @show{(code '(is-MA CT7))}? @fitb{5em}{@ifsoln{false}}

@center{**Try typing each of this into the Interactions Area on the right. Were you correct?**}

@n In the Interactions Area, type @show{(code '(filter covid-table is-MA))}. What did this evaluate to? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{A Table just for data from Massachusetts}}

@n Type `MA-table` in the Interactions Area, then read the code on line 29 carefully. What is that code doing? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Defining a new table called `MA-table`, which is all the rows from our original table where state is "MA"}}

@center{**Stop here! We'll continue after some discussion.**}
