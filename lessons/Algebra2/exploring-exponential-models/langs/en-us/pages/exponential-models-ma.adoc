== Fitting the Model Visually - MA

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, you'll need to have *Slide 3: Exponential Model for MA* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* open on your computer.

@n Try changing the value of @math{k}, then @math{a}, then @math{b} to find three promising exponential models, graphing each one and labeling your values on the grids below.

== Fitting the Model Programmatically - MA

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, open your copy of the @starter-file{alg2-covid}.

@n In the space below, define `exponential` for one of the models you fit in Desmos.

@ifsoln{@vspace{1ex}}

@ifsoln{*Answers will vary.* If @math{a = 31.6}, @math{b = 1.047} and @math{k = 119000}, you would get the following:}

`fun exponential(x): (` @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{31.6}}{a} `* num-expt(` @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{1.047}}{b} `, (~1 * x))) +` @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{119000}}{k} `end`

@indented{
_Two Notes on this function definition:_

* `num-expt` _is the function that we use for exponents. It takes in 2 numbers: the base and the power, in this case @math{b} and @math{x}._
* `(~1 * x)` _at first it may appear that @math{x} is being multiplied by negative 1, but it is actually being multiplied by `*~1*` (literally the value "roughly 1"). This tells Pyret to round off the calculation, prioritizing *speed* over *precision* to get a result that is "roughly accurate". We've added this to the function definition so that you won't have to wait for several minutes for Pyret to run `fit-model` to get an answer for question 4._

@n Update the definition for `exponential` in the Definitions Area and click "Run" to reload it. +
@hspace{1em}Then use `fit-model` to determine how closely `exponential` fits the `MA-table` and fill in the blanks below to interpret the model. +

According to this exponential model, on @fitbruby{6em}{June 9, 2020}{day zero} there were about 
@fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{32}}{a} + @fitbruby{5em}{@ifsoln{119,000}}{k} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{positive covid cases}}{y-units} in MA, for a total of about 
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{119,032}}{a + k}. This number grew exponentially, increasing by a factor of @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{1.047}}{Growth Factor: b} or 
@fitbruby{9em}{@ifsoln{4.7}}{@math{Growth Rate: (b - 1) \times 100}} % every day. The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about 
@fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{13,374}}{S}@fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{positive COVID cases}}{units}, which is a(n) @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{moderate}}{bad, ok, good} model considering that
@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-units} in this dataset range from @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{104156}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{341925}}{highest y-value}.

Data scientists perform calculations to do things like send satellites to far-away planets, or analyze large populations of a billion or more. +

- When calculating a path over an extremely long distance, missing decimal places could result in the Mars Rover missing its destination.
- For an extremely large population like China, rounding to 10 decimal places might result in discounting an entire sub-population!
