Decide whether each situation is best described by a linear, quadratic, or exponential function. **If the function is exponential:** What is the growth factor. Is it doubling (factor of 2)? Tripling (factor of 3)? Factor of 5? 10?

| **@n The resale value of a car drops by a fixed percentage each year. A particular kind of car sells for $32,000, and its value drops by 12.5% each year**

@hspace{6em} +a.+ When the car is brand-new (x=0), how much is it worth? @right{@fitb{8em}{$32,000}}

@hspace{6em} +b.+ How much is it worth after 1 year (x=1)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$28,000}}}

@hspace{6em} +c.+ After two years (x=2)? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$24,500}} After three years (x=3)? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$21,437.50}} Four (x=4)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$18,757.81}}}

@hspace{6em} +d.+ What is the *form* of this function (linear, quadratic, or exponential)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{Exponential}}}

@hspace{6em} +e.+ *If it's exponential*, what is the initial value? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{$32,000}} The base? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{1/8}} Is it growth or decay? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{decay}}}





| **@n Sally is selling lemonade, for $1.25 a glass. She starts with $20 in cash, and hopes that by selling lemonade she will finally be able to get the power drill she's been wanting.**

@hspace{6em} +a.+ When Sally starts the day (x=0), how many dollars does she have? @right{@fitb{8em}{$0}}

@hspace{6em} +b.+ How many dollars will she have after the first sale (x=1)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{20 + 1.25 = $21.25}}}

@hspace{6em} +c.+ After the sale (x=2)? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$22.50}} The third (x=3)? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$23.75}} The fourth (x=4)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{$25.00}}}

@hspace{6em} +d.+ What is the *form* of this function (linear, quadratic, or exponential)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{Linear}}}

@hspace{6em} +e.+ *If it's exponential*, what is the initial value? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{N/A}} The base? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{N/A}} Is it growth or decay? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{N/A}}}




| **@n Mrs. Bidwell's club rules are that every student should high-five every other student. She starts out her year with only two students, but a new one joins the club every day.**

@hspace{6em} +a.+ How many high-fives happen at the start (x=0), with 2 students? @right{@fitb{8em}{1}}

@hspace{6em} +b.+ How many high-fives happen the next day (x=1), with 3 students? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{3}}}

@hspace{6em} +c.+ With a fourth? (x=2)? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{6}} A fifth (x=3)? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{10}} A sixth (x=4)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{15}}}

@hspace{6em} +d.+ What is the *form* of this function (linear, quadratic, or exponential)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{Quadratic}}}

@hspace{6em} +e.+ *If it's exponential*, what is the initial value? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{N/A}} The base? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{N/A}} Is it growth or decay? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{N/A}}}




| **@n A meme goes viral on the internet, starting with one person posting an animation of a puppy doing a backflip into a pile of laundry. Every person that sees the meme falls in love with it, sharing it with 25 new friends.**

@hspace{6em} +a.+ When the person posts it (x=0), how many total times has it been shared? @right{@fitb{8em}{1}}

@hspace{6em} +b.+ How many times will it have been shared after those friends share it (x=1)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{10 + 1 = 11}}}

@hspace{6em} +c.+ When x=2? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{111}} When x=3? @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{1111}} When x=4? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{11111}}}

@hspace{6em} +d.+ What is the *form* of this function (linear, quadratic, or exponential)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{Exponential}}}

@hspace{6em} +e.+ *If it's exponential*, what is the initial value? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{1}} The base? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{10}} Is it growth or decay? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{growth}}}
