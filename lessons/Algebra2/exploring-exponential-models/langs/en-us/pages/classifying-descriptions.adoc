Decide whether each situation is best described by a linear, quadratic, or exponential function. **If the function is exponential:** What is the growth factor. Is it doubling (factor of 2)? Tripling (factor of 3)? Factor of 5? 10?

| **Four friends decide to survey the kids at their school, asking them what the theme for the prom should be. Each one of them takes the survey, then sends the link to three friends, and then asks _those_ friends to send the link to three more, and so on.**

@hspace{6em} +a.+ When the four students take the survey (round 0), how many total responses are there? @right{@fitb{8em}{4}}

@hspace{6em} +b.+ How many total responses will there be after their friends take the survey (round 1)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{4 + 12 = 16}}}

@hspace{6em} +c.+ After _their friends' friends (round 2)?_ @fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{52}} After round 3? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{268}}}

@hspace{6em} +d.+ What is the *form* of this function (linear, quadratic, or exponential)? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{Exponential}}}

@hspace{6em} +e.+ *If it's exponential*, what is the initial value? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{4}}. The growth factor? @fitb{4em}{@ifsoln{3}}

| **A meme goes viral on the internet, starting with one person posting an animation of a puppy doing a backflip into a pile of laundry. Every person that sees the meme falls in love with it, sharing it with 25 new friends.**

@hspace{6em} +a.+ When the person posts it (round 0), how many total times has it been shared? @right{@fitb{8em}{1}}

@hspace{6em} +b.+ How many times will it have been shared after round 1? @right{@fitb{8em}{@ifsoln{10 + 1 = 11}}}
