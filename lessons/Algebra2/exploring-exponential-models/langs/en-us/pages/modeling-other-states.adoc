For this page, you'll need to have the @starter-file{alg2-covid} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Find the function called `is-MA` in the Definitions Area under "Define some helper functions" and read the comments carefully!

@indented{
+a.+ What is the Domain of `is-MA`? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{Row}} What is its Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}

+b.+ What do you _think_ @show{(code '(is-MA MA1))} will evalute to? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{true}}. @show{(code '(is-MA CT1))}? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{false}}. @show{(code '(is-MA ME1))}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{false}}


@vspace{1ex}

_Try typing each of the `is-MA` expressions into the Interactions Area on the right and confirm you were correct._
}

@n Find `MA-table` in the Definitions Area under "Define some grouped and/or random samples". What is that code doing? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Defining a new table called `MA-table`, which is all the rows from our original table where state is "MA"}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n *Define a new function* `is-VT` and *create a new grouped sample* called `VT-table`. +
_Hint: You can use the code for `is-MA` and `MA-table` as a model._

== Modeling VT

[.linkInstructions]
For this section, in addition to Pyret, you will  need to have *Slide 5: Exponential Model for VT* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* open on your computer.

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the best-possible linear model for the relationship between `day` and `positive` in the `VT-table`, then fill in the blanks below:

@indented{
The optimized linear model for this dataset predicts an @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} of about @fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{21}}{slope} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} per @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{day}}{x-variable}. +
The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{826}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{units},
which is 
@fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{significant}}{insignificant, moderate, significant, extreme} considering that @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from 
@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{1092}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{6781}}{highest y-value}.}

@n Use *Slide 5: Exponential Model for VT* of *Modeling Covid Spread (Desmos)* to come up with the best exponential model you can for the Vermont dataset, and write it below: +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{*Answers will vary.* Here's one for reference: `fun exponential-VT(x):  (0.08 * num-expt(1.06, (~1 * x))) + 1400 end`
}}

@n Add a definition for `exponential-VT` to the Definitions area of @starter-file{alg2-covid} using the model you just found. 

- Click "Run" to load your definition.
- Then fit the model using `VT-table`

@indented{
According to this exponential model, on @fitbruby{6em}{June 9, 2020}{day zero} there were about 
@fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{0.08}}{a} + @fitbruby{2em}{@ifsoln{1400}}{k} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{positive COVID cases}}{y-units} in VT, for a total of about 
@fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{1400}}{a + k}. This number grew exponentially, increasing by a factor of 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{1.06}}{Growth Factor: b} or 
@fitbruby{9em}{@ifsoln{6}}{Growth Rate: (b - 1) &times; 100} % every day. The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about 
@fitbruby{2em}{@ifsoln{547}}{S}@fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{positive COVID cases}}{units}, which is @fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{significant}}{insignificant, moderate, significant, extreme} considering that 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-units} in this dataset range from 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{1092}}{lowest y-value} to 
@fitbruby{6em}{@ifsoln{6781}}{highest y-value}. 
}

@n Are exponential models a good fit for this data? Why or why not? @fitb{}{} +
