For this page, you'll need to have the @starter-file{alg2-covid} open on your computer. If you haven't already, select *Save a Copy* from the "File" menu to make a copy of the file that's just for you.

@n Find the function called `is-MA` in the Definitions Area under "Define some helper functions" and read the comments carefully!

@indented{
+a.+ What is the Domain of `is-MA`? @fitb{20em}{@ifsoln{Row}} What is its Range? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Boolean}}

+b.+ What do you _think_ @show{(code '(is-MA MA1))} will evalute to? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{true}}. @show{(code '(is-MA CT1))}? @fitb{7em}{@ifsoln{false}}. @show{(code '(is-MA ME1))}? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{false}}


@vspace{1ex}

_Try typing each of the `is-MA` expressions into the Interactions Area on the right and confirm you were correct._
}

@n Find `MA-table` in the Definitions Area under "Define some grouped and/or random samples". What is that code doing? @fitb{}{} +
@fitb{}{@ifsoln{Defining a new table called `MA-table`, which is all the rows from our original table where state is "MA"}} +
@fitb{}{}

@n *Define a new function* `is-VT` and *create a new grouped sample* called `VT-table`. +
_Hint: You can use the code for `is-MA` and `MA-table` as a model._

@n Use `lr-plot` to obtain the best-possible linear model for the relationship between `day` and `positive` in the `VT-table`, then fill in the blanks below:

@indented{
The optimized linear model for this dataset predicts an @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} of about @fitbruby{3em}{@ifsoln{21}}{slope} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} per @fitbruby{7em}{@ifsoln{day}}{x-variable}. +
The error in the model is described by an @vocab{S-value} of about @fitbruby{1em}{@ifsoln{826}}{S}@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{units},
which is 
@fitbruby{16em}{@ifsoln{significant}}{insignificant, moderate, significant, extreme} considering that @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{positive cases}}{y-variable} in this dataset range from 
@fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{1092}}{lowest y-value} to @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{6781}}{highest y-value}.}

@n Define the best exponential model you can for the Vermont dataset, and write it below: +
@fitb{}{}

@star Choose a different state: @fitbruby{10em}{}{state}, and determine the best exponential model you can: +
@fitb{}{}
