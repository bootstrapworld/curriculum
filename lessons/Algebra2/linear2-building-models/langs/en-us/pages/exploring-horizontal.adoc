== Exploring @math{z(x)=m(x-0) + k}
@link-instructions{These questions are for slide 1.}

@n When @math{m = 0.5} and
@math{h = 4.6}, what value for @math{k} will land the blue line on top of the black line? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-2.3}}

@n Move the sliders to new values for @math{m = } @fitb{3em}{} and @math{h = } @fitb{3em}{}. What value for @math{k} will land the blue line on top of the black line now? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-2.3}}

@n Continue experimenting with the sliders. Can you find any values for @math{m} and
@math{h} for which you can't land the blue line on top of the black line by changing @math{k}?

== What pattern do you notice about the relationship between m, h and k?

@n If you knew the m and h values, how could you find the value of k? @fitb{}{}

@link-instructions{Advance to slide 2 and confirm that your answer for the last question was correct.}

@n What directions would you give to someone about how to predict the h-value of a horizontal shift that will translate to a vertical shift? @fitb{}{}
