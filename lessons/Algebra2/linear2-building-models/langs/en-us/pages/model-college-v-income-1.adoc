== The Alabama -- Alaska Model
@link-instructions{
Open the @starter-file{alg2-states}.

@vspace{1ex}

@n Record the `pct-college-or-higher` and `median-income` values for the `alabama` and `alaska` rows, as @math{(x,y)} pairs below:

@center{
 (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{22.6}}{AL pct-college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{43253}}{AL median-income}) @hspace{10em} (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{27.5}}{AK pct-college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{70760}}{AK median-income})
}

@n Compute the equation of the line passing between these two points using the space below. *This line will be your linear model* (also known as the "predictor function", or "line of best fit"), which predicts `median-income` as a function of `pct-college-or-higher`.

@n Write the complete model below (in both Function and Pyret notation):

@center{
 @math{\text{al-ak}(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{5613.67}}{slope(m)}x + @fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{-83616.02}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (al-ak x) (+ (* (?ANS 5613.67) x) (?ANS -83616.02))))}
}

@n What median income does this model expect a state without ANY college graduates (0%) to earn? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-$83616.02}}

@n What does this model predict?

@indented{
A model built from Alaska and Alabama expects that median income for a state without ANY college graduates (0%) will be @fitb{10em}{@ifsoln{-$83616.02}} and predicts that a 1 percent increase in @fitbruby{12em}{college degrees}{x-variable units} is associated with a @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{$5613.67}}{y-units} @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{increase}}{increase / decrease} in @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{median household income}}{y-variable units}.

Return to your copy of the starter file and define `al-ak` on line 44 of the Definitions Area. Then Click "Run". +
_(If there are any errors or warnings, fix them and click "Run" again.)_ 

@n In the Interactions Area, try plugging in the `pct-college-or-higher` value for Alabama by typing `al-ak(22.6)`.

- How well does it predict the correct median income for Alabama? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{close! 43252.922}} 

- What would you type to predict median income for Alaska? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`al-ak(27.5)`}}

- How well does it predict the correct median income for Alaska? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{close! 70759.905}} +
_Consider: If it doesn't predict it perfectly, why might that be?_

@vspace{1ex}

Try different `pct-college-or-higher` values from _other_ states, to see how well our Alabama-Alaska model fits the rest of the country. 

@n Identify a state for which this model works well: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Examples: Iowa, Indiana...}}

@n Identify a state for which this model works poorly: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Examples: Vermont, Massachusetts...}}

== Another Model

@n Look at the scatter plot. Imagine you were going to define another model. Identify two other states that would likely generate a better fit.

@fitb{25em}{} @hspace{1em} and @hspace{1em} @fitb{25em}{}

@teacher{Answers will vary. But West Virginia and Massachusetts could be a good option.}
