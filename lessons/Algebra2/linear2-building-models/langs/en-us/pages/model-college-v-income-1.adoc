Open the @starter-file{alg2-states-intro}. 

@vspace{1ex}

@n Record the `pct-college-or-higher` and `median-income` values for the `alabama` and `alaska` rows, as @math{(x,y)} pairs below:

@center{
 (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{22.6}}{AL pct-college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{43253}}{AL median-income}) @hspace{10em} (@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{27.5}}{AK pct-college-or-higher}, @fitbruby{12em}{@ifsoln{70760}}{AK median-income})
}

@n Using the space below, compute the equation of the line passing between these two points. *This line will be your linear model* (also known as the "predictor function", or "line of best fit"), which predicts `median-income` as a function of `pct-college-or-higher`.

@n Write the complete model below (in both Function and Pyret notation):

@center{
 @math{\mbox{al-ak}(x) =} @fitbruby{8em}{@ifsoln{5613.67}}{slope(m)}x + @fitbruby{11em}{@ifsoln{-83616.02}}{y-intercept / vertical shift} @hspace{5em} @show{(code '(define (al-ak x) (+ (* (?ANS 5613.67) x) (?ANS -83616.02))))}
}

@vspace{2ex}

Return to your copy of the starter file and add the code you just wrote to the Definitions Area. Then Click "Run". +
_(If there are any errors or warnings, fix them and click "Run" again.)_ 

@n In the Interactions Area, try plugging in the `pct-college-or-higher` value for Alabama by typing `al-ak(22.6)`.

- How well does it predict the correct median income for Alabama? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{close! 43252.922}} 
- What expression would predict median income for Alaska? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{`al-ak(27.5)`}}.
- How well does it predict the correct median income for Alaska? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{close! 70759.905}} +
_Consider: If it doesn't predict it perfectly, why might that be?_

@vspace{1ex}

Try different `pct-college-or-higher` values from _other_ states, to see how well our Alabama-Alaska model fits the rest of the country. 

@n Identify a state for which this model works well: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Examples: Iowa, Indiana...}}

@n Identify a state for which this model works poorly: @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Examples: Vermont, Massachusetts...}}

@n What median income does this model expect a state without ANY college graduates (0%) to earn? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{-$83616.02}}
