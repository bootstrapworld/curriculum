= Method Chaining

*Method chaining* allows us to apply multiple methods with less code:
For example, instead of using multiple definitions, like this:

  with-labels = animals-table.build-column("labels", nametag)
  cats = with-labels.filter(is-cat)
  cats.order-by("age", true)

We can use method-chaining to write it all on one line, like this:

  animals-table.build-column("labels", nametag).filter(is-cat).order-by("age", true)

*Order Matters!* The methods are applied in the order they appear. For example,
trying to order a table by a column that hasn’t been built will result in an error.
