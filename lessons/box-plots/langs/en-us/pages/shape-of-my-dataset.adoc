Find the measures of center and spread to summarize a column of your dataset. 

The column I chose to summarize is: @fitb{}{}

@vspace{1ex}

== Measures of Center
--
The three measures of center for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Mean (Average) 	| Median 	| Mode(s)
|					|			|
|===
--

Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[higher/lower/about equal]} compared to the median, this suggests the shape is @fitbruby{60ex}{}{[skewed right (or high outliers) / skewed left (or low outliers) / symmetric]}.


== Measures of Spread
--
My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum 	| Q1 	| Q2 (Median) 	| Q3 	| Maximum
| 			|		|				|		|
