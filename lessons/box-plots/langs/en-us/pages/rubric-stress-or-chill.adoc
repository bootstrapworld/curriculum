| Data collection
| __This data is an accurate reflection of my stress level.__ I completed the stress survey each morning, afternoon, and evening. If I was unable to complete the form at the required time, I completed it as soon as possible. I gave accurate information by observing my mood and my surroundings.
|  __This data is a decent reflection of my stress level.__ I sometimes forgot to fill in the stress survey. When I responded to the prompts, I tried my best to give accurate information, but sometimes I made guesses because I couldn't quite remember the details.
| __This data not a great reflection of my stress level.__ I often forgot to fill in the stress survey. I had to go back and dig through my memories to make guesses about stress at various points throughout the day.

| Summary of my stress levels (graphics)
| I included many plots (including box plots!), numerical summaries, and photographs to represent my stress levels over the five-day period.
| I have some plots, numerical summaries, and photographs to represent my stress levels - but I didn't choose them for any particular reason and they don't precisely represent my stress.
| The plots, numerical summaries, and photographs that I’ve included do not accurately represent my stress. What I wrote is not as clear as it could be.

| Summary of my stress levels (writing)
| The text that I wrote accurately describes trends that I observed when analyzing my stress. My writing clearly draws on the evidence that I provided via my graphics. As a result, the reader has a clear sense of my typical stress level and what factors affect it.
| The text describing my stress level and stressors could use some extra detail. It is not clear that I have thoughtfully analyzed the data presented. My writing is not always based in the data and evidence I supplied.
| My writing is unclear or confusing, leaving the reader asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.

| Summary of class stress levels (graphics)
| I’ve included a variety of plots and numerical summaries to represent our class stress levels and stressors over the five-day period.
| I have a few plots and numerical summaries to represent our class stress levels and stressors, but I didn't have a specific reason for choosing them.
| My plots and numerical summaries do not adequately represent our class stress levels and stressors. What I wrote is not as clear as it could be.

| Summary of class stress levels (writing)
| The text that I wrote compares my stress levels and stressors to those of the class. My observations are clearly drawn from the data that I’ve shared and my arguments are convincing.
| The text that I wrote, comparing my stress levels and stressors to those of the class, would benefit from additional detail. My writing is not always based in the data and evidence I supplied.
| My written descriptions are confusing, leaving the reader asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.

| Connecting stress level and personality type (graphics and writing )
| I included a graph that I chose to highlight the relationship (or lack thereof) between stress and personality type. The text accurately describes the provided graph and supports my claim about this relationship.
| I included a plot that highlights the relationship (or lack thereof) between stress and personality types - but I did not choose it for a clear reason. The text somewhat supports my claim about this relationship; additional analysis and explanation are needed, however.
| The graph I included to connect stress level and personality type does not actually connect these two variables. What I wrote about personality assessments and their value is not as clear as it could be.
