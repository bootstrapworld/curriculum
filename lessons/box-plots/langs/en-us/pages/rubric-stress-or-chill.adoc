| Data collection
| I filled in the stress survey three times per day - in the morning, afternoon, and evening. If I was unable to complete the form at the time of the stress check, I made a point of completing it as soon as possible. When I responded to the prompts, I gave accurate information by observing my mood and my surroundings.
| I sometimes forgot to fill in the stress survey. When I responded to the prompts, I tried my best to give accurate information, but sometimes I made guesses because I couldn't quite remember the details. Overall, the accuracy of the data collected is decent, however.
| I often forgot to fill in the stress survey. I had to go back and dig through my memories to make educated guesses about stress at various points throughout the day. The information recorded during the data collection phase is most likely not an accurate depiction of my day.

| Summary of my stress levels (graphics)
| I’ve included a rich variety of plots, numerical summaries, and photographs to represent my stress levels over the five-day period.
| I have a few plots, numerical summaries, and photographs to represent my stress levels - but it is not crystal clear why I chose them or how they represent my stress.
| The plots, numerical summaries, and photographs that I’ve included do not accurately represent my stress. It is confusing to the reader what I am trying to portray.

| Summary of my stress levels (writing)
| The text that I wrote accurately describes interesting trends that I observed when analyzing my stress. My written analysis clearly draws on the evidence that I provided via my graphics. As a result, the reader has a clear sense of my typical stress level anad what factors affect my stress.
| The text describing my stress level and stressors would benefit from additional detail. It is not clear to the reader that I have thoughtfully analyzed the data presented. My writing is sometimes evidence-based, but sometimes not.
| My written descriptions are confusing, leaving the reader asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.

| Summary of class stress levels (graphics)
| I’ve included a variety of plots and numerical summaries to represent our class stress levels and stressors over the five-day period.
| I have a few plots and numerical summaries to represent our class stress levels and stressors, but it is not crystal clear why I chose them.
| The plots and numerical summaries that I’ve included do not adequately represent our class stress levels and stressors. It is confusing to the reader what I am trying to portray.

| Summary of class stress levels (writing)
| The text that I wrote highlights compares my stress levels and stressors to those of the class. My observations are clearly drawn from the data that I’ve shared and my arguments are compelling.
| The text describing class stress levels (and how they differ from my own) would benefit from additional detail. It is not clear to the reader that I have thoughtfully analyzed the data presented. My writing is sometimes evidence-based, but sometimes not.
| My written descriptions are confusing, leaving the reader asking questions. My analysis does not appear to be drawn from the data that I collected, nor is it evidence-based.

| Connecting stress level and personality type (graphics and writing )
| I’ve included a graph that highlights the relationship (or lack thereof) between stress and personality type. The accompanying text accurately describes the provided graph and supports my claim that personality assessments do (or do not) tell us useful things about a person's personality.
| I included a graph to highlights the relationship (or lack thereof) between stress and personality types - but it is not entirely clear why I chose this graph. The accompanying text somewhat supports my claim that personality assessments do (or do not) tell us useful things about a person's personality; additional analysis and explanation are needed, however.
| The graph I included to connect stress level and personality type does not actually connect these two variables. It is confusing to the reader what I am trying to say about personality assessments and their value.
