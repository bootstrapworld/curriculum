== Measures of Spread @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to the notion of _spread_ in a dataset. They learn about quartiles, box plots, and how to use them to talk about spread.

=== Launch
When we explored measures of center, we tried to answer a question about "typical" values:

[.lesson-point]
_The Animal Shelter Bureau says a typical pet weighs almost 41 pounds_

This is helpful, but it really doesn't tell the whole story. Maybe all the pets weigh between 35 and 45 pounds, so nobody is more than 5-6 pounds from the mean. But we could _also_ have an average of 41 pounds, with snuggles the Tarantula weighing hardly anything and Kujo weighing more than 150!

So once we have our summary for a "normal value", it's likely we'll ask another question:

[.lesson-point]
If a typical pet is 41 pounds, just _how_ typical is that?

There are differences in every class of students. Not everyone likes the same music, not everyone dresses the same, etc. So we'd expect some deviation - or @vocab{spread} - in any class of students! But some classes are more different than others. How do we measure the spread of a population?

Suppose we lined up all of the values in the pounds column of the animals dataset from smallest to largest, and then split the line up into two equal groups by taking the @vocab{median}. We can learn something about the @vocab{spread} of the dataset by taking things further: The middle of the lighter half of animals is called the first @vocab{quartile} - or "Q1" - and the middle of the heavier half of animals is the third quartile (also called "Q3"). Once we find these numbers, we can say that the middle half of the animals’ weights are spread between Q1 and Q3.

[.lesson-instruction]
The first quartile (Q1) is the value for which 25% of the animals weighed that amount or less. What does the third quartile represent?

Besides looking at the median as center, and the spread between Q1 and Q3, we also gain valuable information from the spread of the entire dataset—that is, the distance between minimum and maximum. This is called the @vocab{range of a dataset}. (*Note*: the term “Range” means something different in statistics than it does in algebra and programming!)

Splitting a dataset into @vocab{quartiles} gives us five numbers that we can play with to measure spread. To summarize what we've seen so far:

. Minimum: _the smallest value in a dataset_
. Q2 / Median: _the middle value in a dataset_
. Q1: _the value that falls between the minimum and Q2_
. Q3: _the value that falls between the minimum and Q2_
. Maximum: _the largest value in a dataset_

Taken together these are called the *5 Number Summary* of a dataset, and this summary is one tool for calculating spread. We can use these numbers to calculate two new values:

- Minimum - Maximum = *Range*:  _the distance spanned by the extreme values in the dataset_
- Q3 - Q1 = *IQR*:  _the "Interquartile Range", or the distance spanned by the middle half of the data_

We can use @vocab{box plots} to visualize the 5 number summary, the Range, and the Interquartile Range. Below is the contract for `box-plot`, along with an example that will make a box plot for the `pounds` column in the `animals-table`.

@show{
(contract
  "box-plot" '("Table", "String") "Image"
  "Consumes a table and the name of the column to plot, and produces a box plot"
)

(code '(box-plot animals-table "pounds"))
}

[.lesson-point]
Box plots divide our sample into equally-sized groups, and show where those groups are spread thin or clumped together.

[.lesson-instruction]
Type in this expression in the Interactions Area, and see the resulting plot.

@right{@centered-image{images/5-plot.png, 5 plot, 400}}

This plot shows us the center and spread in our dataset according to those five numbers.

- The *minimum* value in the dataset (at the left of “whisker”). In our dataset, that’s just 0.1 pounds.
- The *First Quartile (Q1)* (the left edge of the box), is computed by taking _the median of the lower half of the values_. In the pounds column, that’s 3.9 pounds.
- The *Median* value (the line in the middle), which is the middle Quartile of the whole dataset. We already computed this to be 11.3 pounds.
- The *Third Quartile (Q3)* (the right edge of the box), which is computed by taking _the median of the upper half of the values_. That’s 60.4 pounds in our dataset.
- The *maximum* value in the dataset (at the right of the “whisker”). In our dataset, that’s 172 pounds.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
* Turn to @printable-exercise{measures-of-center/pages/summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}
* Fill in the five-number summary for the `pounds` column, and sketch the box plot.
* What conclusions can you draw about the distribution of values in this column?

Data Scientists subtract the 1st quartile from the 3rd quartile to compute the range of the “middle half” of the dataset, also called the @vocab{interquartile range}.

@span{.title}{Kinesthetic Activity}

Divide the class into groups, and give each group a ruler and a ball of playdough. Have them draw a number line from 0-6 with the ruler, marking off the points at 0, 3, 4, 4.5 and 6 inches. Have the groups roll the dough into a thick cylinder, divide that cylinder in half, and then split each half to form four __equally-sized cylinders__. The playdough represents a @vocab{sample}, with values divided into four @vocab{quartiles}.

Box plots stretch and squeeze these equal quartiles across a number line, so that each quartile fills up an interval in that quartile. On their number line, students have intervals from 0-3, 3-4, 4-4.5, and 4.5-6. Have students roll their cylinders so that they fill each of these intervals, retaining a uniform thickness.

They should notice that shorter intervals have __thicker cylinders__, and longer ones have skinny ones. Even though a box plot doesn't show us the thickness of the datapoints, we can tell that a small intervals has the same amount of data "squeezed" into it as a large interval.

|===

[.lesson-instruction]
* Find the @vocab{interquartile range} of this dataset.
* What percentage of animals fall within the interquartile range?
* What percentage of animals fall below the First Quartile? Above the Third Quartile? What percentage fall anywhere between the minimum and the maximum?

Now that you’re comfortable creating box plots and looking at measures of spread on the computer, it’s time to put your skills to the test!

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/interpreting-spread.adoc} and complete the questions you see there.

Just as pie and bar charts are ways of visualizing categorical data, box plots and histograms are both ways of visualizing the shape of quantitative data. Box plots make it easy to see the 5-number summary, and compare the Range and Interquartile Range. Histograms make it easier to see skewness and more details of the shape, and offer more granularity when using smaller bins.

Left-skewness is seen as a long tail in a histogram. In a box plot, it's seen as a longer left "whisker" or more spread in the left part of the box. Likewise, right skewness is shown as a longer right "whisker" or more spread in the right part of the box.

Box plots and Histograms can both tell us a lot about the shape of a dataset, but they do so by grouping data quite differently. A box plot is always divided into four parts, which may fall on differently-sized intervals but all contain the same number of points. A histogram, on the other hand, has identically-sized intervals which can contain very different numbers of points.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/identifying-shape-boxplots.adoc} and see if you can describe box plots using what you know about skewness.

*Challenge Questions:*
- Compare the histograms for the `pounds` column of both cats and dogs in the dataset. Are their shapes different? How much overlap is there?
- Compare the histograms for the `age` column of both cats and dogs in the dataset. Are their shapes different? How much overlap is there?
- Can you explain why the amount of overlap between these two distributions is different?

=== Common Misconceptions
It is extremely common for students to forget that every quartile _always_ includes 25% of the dataset. This will need to be heavily reinforced.

=== Synthesize
Histograms, box plots, and measures of center and spread are all different ways to get at the @vocab{shape} of our data. It's important to get comfortable using every tool in the toolbox when discussing shape!

@span{.title}{Modified Box Plots}
More Statistics- or Math-oriented classes will also be familiar with __modified box plots__ (@link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm_852R8JPw, video explanation}), which remove outliers from the box-and-whisker and draw them as asterisks outside of the plot. Modified box plots are also available in Bootstrap:Data Science, using the following contract:

@show{(contract "modified-box-plot" '("Table", "String") "Image" )}

== Comparing Box Plots @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical distributions.

=== Launch
__"Do dogs take longer to get adopted than cats?"__

This is asking us about the interaction between a categorical variable (`species`) and a quantitative one (`weeks`). Instead of creating a whole new display, all we have to do is make _separate_ box plots for the distribution of `weeks` for both cats and dogs. Note: this works fine as long as we’re sure to use a common scale! Both box plots (see below) share the same axis for adoption times, which ranges from about 1 to 10 weeks.

Box plots make it easy to decide if values of a quantitative variable seem to be mostly similar or mostly different, depending on which group an individual is in. The trick is to train your eyes to look for whether there’s a lot of overlap in the two box plots, or if one is noticeably higher than the other.

=== Investigate
Have students break into groups of 3-4, and compare the box plot of weeks-to-adoption for cats with the one for dogs. *Note:* they can  generate the pair of box plots themselves, but we recommend simply giving them this image: @image{images/weeks-cats-v-dogs.png, "Two partially-overlapping box plots", cats v. dogs}

[.lesson-instruction]
. Do the two box plots mostly overlap, or does one have a noticeably different range than the other?
. How do the medians compare?


Next, each group examines the pair of box plots that compare weeks to adoption for fixed versus unfixed animals: @image{images/weeks-fixed-v-unfixed.png, "Two partially-overalapping box plots",fixed v. unfixed}. Once again, consider how similar or different the two plots seem.

[.lesson-instruction]
. Do the two box plots mostly overlap, or does one have a noticeably different range than the other?
. How do the medians compare?

Students should confirm that the box plots for adoption times of unfixed versus fixed animals have more overlap than the box plots for adoption times of cats versus dogs.

[.lesson-point]
Box plots create __varying-size__ bins, which contain a fixed number of datapoints.

This is in contrast to @vocab{histograms}, which have __fixed-size__ bins with varying numbers of datapoints. We can imagine the data as being a pile of pizza dough, divided into four equally-sized quartiles. When the data is tightly packed, the bin is narrow. When it's spread out, the bin is wide. Histograms show data clusters as tall bars, whereas box plots show clusters as narrow quartiles.

[.lesson-point]
Box plots and histograms give us two different views on the concept of shape.

*Histograms:* fixed intervals (“bins”) with variable numbers of data points in each one. Points “pile up in bins”, so we can see how many are in each. __Larger bars show where the clusters are.__

*Box plots:* variable intervals (“quartiles”) with a fixed number of data points in each one. Treats data more like “pizza dough”, dividing it into four equal quarters showing where the data is tightly clumped or spread thin. __Smaller intervals show where the clusters are.__

[.lesson-instruction]

=== Synthesize
Referring to our Dogs v. Cats box plots, the dogs’ adoption times were much higher than the cats’; the top half of the dogs’ box plot doesn’t overlap at all with the cats’ box plot. Does this suggest that species _does_ or _does not_ play a role in how long it takes for an animal to be adopted?

Referring to our Fixed v. Unfixed box plots, we saw that adoption times for unfixed and fixed animals overlapped a lot, and the medians were pretty close. Does this suggest that being fixed _does_ or _does not_ play a role in how long it takes for an animal to be adopted?

Which variable seems to have more of an effect on adoption time: species (cat or dog) or whether an animal is fixed or not? Have students share back their findings.
