= Image Transformations

*Students will learn new functions that mimic the geometric transformations of rotation and reflection.*

|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of rotations
* Demonstrate understanding of reflections over the x- and y- axis

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can transform images using rotations.
* I can transform images using reflections.  

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* It’s important that students use non-symmetrical images so that they can see the transformations.  Text images work well for this!
* Students should notice that rotations are counterclockwise unless the rotation angle is negative. 


|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.

== Get Ready:

Before the lesson, the facilitator should use the *text* function to create an image of their name in large letters.  Have the image (but not the code) visible to students as they enter.  _(Use the slider between the Definitions and Interactions windows to hide the code.)_ 

For example: (text "Ms. Frizzle" 100 "orange")

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

== Launch: (5 min)

As students enter, ask them if they remember the @vocab{function} used to create the name on display.  Ask students to create a similar text image for themselves, referring to their contracts page if necessary.

== Explore: (10 min)

Inform students that there are three new functions to investigate today, and it's their job to explore and learn all they can about these new functions and their @vocab{contract}s.

Students try out reflect-x, reflect-y, and rotate on the image of their name, writing down their observations.

== Discuss: (10 min)

* What is the contract for rotate? _rotate: Number Image -> Image_
* What is the contract for reflect-x? _reflect-x: Image -> Image, same for reflect-y_
* How do reflections and rotations have in common? _They are both functions, they both transform, or change, images, they both preserve congruence (isometry)_
* How is a reflection different from a rotation?  _A reflection produces a mirror image, a rotation is like a turn while a reflection is like a flip_
* How do we measure rotations? _Rotations can be measured in degrees or radians, measured counterclockwise_
* Is there a way to use reflections to get the same result as a rotation? _A reflection over both the x- and y- axes produces an image that is the same as if we had rotated the image 180 degrees_

== Practice: (10 min)

“Match My Moves” activity - students get a pre-image and image and figure out the transformations needed to get from the pre-image to the image.

== Create/Apply: (5 min)

Create/Apply task 

== Some demo text only

Test of vocab items:

@vocab{accessor functions}

@vocab{axis}
