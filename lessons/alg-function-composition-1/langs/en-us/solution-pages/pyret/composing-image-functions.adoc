= Composing Image Functions

You’ll be investigating these functions with your partner:

```
# text :: String, Number, String -> Image
# scale :: Number, Image -> Image
# rotate :: Number, Image -> Image
# flip-horizontal :: Image -> Image
# flip-vertical :: Image -> Image
```

1) Make an image of your name, in big purple letters. Draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the code that will create this image.

@show{(sexp->coe '(text "Eric" 24 "purple"))}
@show{(sexp->code '(text "Eric" 24 "purple"))}

Try using the `scale` function to make your name bigger or smaller. Draw the Circle of Evaluation (hint: use what you wrote above!), then write the code.

@show{(sexp->coe '(scale 0.5 (text "Sophie" 24 "purple")))}
@show{(sexp->code '(scale 0.5 (text "Sophie" 24 "purple")))}

In your own words, what does scale do?

@span{.blankline}{}
@span{.blankline}{}

@vspace{20ex}

Try out `rotate`, `flip-horizontal`, and `flip-vertical`. Use the space below to write your
code, then test out your code in WeScheme when you’re ready.
