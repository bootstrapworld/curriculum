= Problem Solving Together

@description{Students practice using the Design Recipe through a variety of collaborative exercises that allow them to interact with each other's work and receive feedback from peers, ultimately helping them to internalize the importance of attending to precision at each step of the way.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Understand how to use the @vocab{Design Recipe} to break down simple word problems.
* Create a strong @vocab{purpose statement} that details in their own words what the @vocab{function} is doing.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use the Design Recipe to break down word problem when writing a function.
* I can identify @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and other quantities in a word problem when writing a function.
* I can create and revise a strong purpose statement that explains what the function is doing.

| Materials
|[.materials-links]


@material-links

| Preparation
| Decide on groups of 3 and print copies of the word problems that you will be using for Design Recipe Telephone

* The Purpose Statement, like the Contract, is a _comment_ - something that the computer doesn't read.  Good comments are important for readability - there may be other people on a team working with the same code!
* The Domain and Range of a function are described as sets (or @vocab{data types}), such as Number, String, or Image.
* This activity can work well as a formative review.
* This activity is a good time to get students working with someone other than their usual coding partner.

== Design Recipe Telephone @duration{45 minutes}

=== Launch
Most computer programs are written by huge teams! It is critical that each team member records their thinking with enough detail for other team members to be able to pick up where they left off.

=== Investigate

@n Divide the class into groups of three.

@n Choose which set of word problems you are going to start with and give each student within each group a different word problem.

_★ Once completed, the set of functions generated from these word problems can be used to fix the code in this @opt-starter-file{collaboration}. If all the functions are defined correctly, the starter file will then generate a cool image!_

| Use any of the practice word problems in the workbook that students haven't solved before.

_★ There is a large collection of math problems that would work well with the Design Recipe in our @link{../functions-dr, Solving Word Problems Using the Design Recipe} lesson._

In this activity, each person in your group will start with a different word problem.

* You will each be doing one step of each Design Recipe problem.
* The student who continues working the problem that you start will be dependent on your work, so pay careful attention to making your part as precisely as possible. If they don't have the information they need, they will give it back to you for revision.
* When you complete your step, you will fold your paper to hide the part that you were looking at so that only your work and the rest of the recipe is visible.
* Then you will pass your work to the person to your right.
* The person who has received your paper will review your work, and complete the next step based solely on what you wrote down for them.
* You will receive a different problem from the person to your left.
* If at any point your realize that the person before you didn't provide enough information, you may hand the paper back to them for revision.

This activity can be repeated several times, or done as a timed competition between teams. The goal is to emphasize that each step - if done correctly - makes the following step incredibly simple.

@span{.title}{Teacher Tool: Where'd You Get That?}

Another activity that reinforces the connections between representations is called "Where'd You Get That?", which can also be used by teachers to help students discover Design Recipe problems without pointing out their mistakes.

The activity requires two people: the Challenger, and the Defender. Most of the time, the teacher is in the role of Challenger.

The Challenger starts at the *bottom* of the page, physically pointing to one part of the function definition and asking "where'd you get that?" The Defender has to _physically point_ to some location in the Examples, and explain exactly how they got that part of the definition.

Once the Defender has shown that they can trace their thinking from Definition to Examples, the game moves to the next stage. The Challenger starts asking about the _Examples_, and now the Defender needs to refer back to the _Contract and Purpose_. This is repeated for every other step in the recipe, as students work their way back to the original word problem. For example:

- *Challenger* (pointing at variable in the Definition): Where'd you get that?
- *Defender* (pointing at label in the Examples): Well, I circled the parts of the Examples that change, and gave them that label.
- *Challenger* (pointing at the label): OK, but where did you get the label?
- *Defender* (pointing at Purpose Statement): I used that term in the Purpose Statement.
- *Challenger* (pointing at Purpose Statement): Where'd you get that term?
- *Defender* (pointing to Word Problem): I got it from reading the Word Problem.

=== Synthesize
The Design Recipe is a way of slowing down and thinking through each step of a problem. If we already know how to get the answer, why would it ever be important to know how to do each step the slow way?

_Sample Responses:_

- Someday we won't be able to get the answer, and knowing the steps will help
- So we can help someone else who is stuck
- So we can work with someone else and share our thinking
- So we can check our work

Which step in the Design Recipe are students feeling the most confident about? The least? At this stage, it is normal for students to feel most confident about the Contract and Examples, and the least confident about Purpose Statements and Definitions.

*Optional:* Ask students to create their own appropriately challenging word problem (with a solution) and collect the responses for later use as "Do Now" tasks or formative assessment.
