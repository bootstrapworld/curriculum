== Composition

[.admin]
Dataset creators should read through the questions in this
section prior to any data collection and then provide answers
once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended
to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific
tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.

// tag::comp-what[]
[.question.required]
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
(e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
description.
// end::comp-what[]

// tag::comp-quantity[]
[.question.required]
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
appropriate)?
// end::comp-quantity[]

// tag::comp-representativeness[]
[.question.required]
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
// end::comp-representativeness[]

// tag::comp-content[]
[.question.required]
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
provide a description.
// end::comp-content[]

// tag::comp-label[]
[.question.optional]
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
so, please provide a description.
// end::comp-label[]

// tag::comp-missing[]
[.question.required]
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
please provide a description, explaining why this information is
missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
redacted text.
// end::comp-missing[]

// tag::comp-relationship[]
[.question.required]

description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
them.
// end::comp-splits[]

// tag::comp-errors[]
[.question.required]
Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
dataset? If so, please provide a description.
// end::comp-errors[]

// tag::comp-selfcontained[]
[.question.common]
Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
provide descriptions of all external resources and any
restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
access points, as appropriate.
// end::comp-selfcontained[]

// tag::comp-selfcontained-common-answer[]
The dataset is self-contained.

There is an archival version of the complete dataset from which this
one was created.

== Process Collection

[.admin]
As with the previous section, dataset creators should read
through these questions prior to any data collection to flag
potential issues and then provide answers once collection is
complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the
answers to questions here may provide information that allow
others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.

// tag::coll-how[]
[.question.required]
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
// end::coll-how[]

students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they
compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?
// end::coll-who[]

// tag::coll-who-common-answer[]
This dataset was created by student volunteers at Brown
University from a parent dataset whose datasheet should provide
information about the collection.
// end::coll-who-common-answer[]

match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the
instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not,
please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with
the instances was created.
// end::coll-time[]

// tag::coll-ethics[]
[.question.common]
Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an
institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description
of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a
link or other access point to any supporting documentation.
// end::coll-ethics[]

directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g.,
websites)?
// end::coll-3rdparty[]

// tag::coll-notification[]
[.question.optional]
Were the individuals in question notified about the data
collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or
other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or
other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language
of the notification itself.
// end::coll-notification[]

// tag::coll-consent[]
[.question.optional]
Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and
use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with
screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and
provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or
otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals
consented.
// end::coll-consent[]

// tag::coll-revoke[]
[.question.optional]
If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals
provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future
or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well
as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if
appropriate).
// end::coll-revoke[]

// tag::coll-impact[]
[.question.optional]
Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its
use on data subjects (e.g., a data protection impact
analysis)been conducted? If so, please provide a description of
this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other
access point to any supporting documentation.
// end::coll-impact[]

// tag::coll-other[]
[.question.optional]
Any other comments?
// end::coll-other[]

== Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

[.admin]
Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any
preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers
once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are
intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they
need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in
ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example,
text that has been converted into a “bag of words” is not
suitable for tasks involving word order.

// tag::preproc-preproc[]
[.question.required]
Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g.,
discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech
tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances,
processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a
description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions
in this section.
// end::preproc-preproc[]

// tag::preproc-save[]
[.question.required]
Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the
preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated
future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point
to the “raw” data.
// end::preproc-save[]

// tag::preproc-software[]
[.question.required]
Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances
available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.
// end::preproc-software[]

// tag::preproc-other[]
[.question.optional]
Any other comments?
// end::preproc-other[]

// end::use-potential[]

// tag::use-future[]
[.question.required]
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
harms?
// end::use-future[]

// tag::use-dontuse[]
[.question.required]
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
so, please provide a description.
