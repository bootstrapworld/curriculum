= Generating JSON object for self-guided book

The build process automatically generates the files containing the
JSON required for the self-guided book. The content of these files
are extracted from their corresponding lesson-plan files. We do
something similar for generating the slides pages too.

Each page in the book typically corresponds to a slide. Note that each slide
starts with a `@slidebreak` (mandatory) and ends with either a
following `@slidebreak` or an AsciiDoc section, whichever comes
earlier. This content becomes the `lessonText` field for that
page.

== Making the book pages different from the slides

In some situations, we don't want an exact 1-to-1 correspondence
between slides and book pages: In such cases, we replace
`@slidebreak` with one of the following:

1. `@slideonlybreak` — the following piece of text is used to
   construct a slide but is ignored in the book

2. `@selfguidedbreak` — the following piece of text will be
   used in the book but ignored for slides

The older directive `@slidebreak`, of course, ensures the following piece of text is
included in both book and slides. (We may need to change these
names later to be more uniform.)

== {editor,image,video}config

A book page also has one of the fields: `editorCode`,
`imageConfig`, or `videoConfig`. To insert these in the
lesson-plan file, use the directives

  @editorconfig{...}
  @imageconfig{...}
  @videoconfig{...}

Note: The directive names are uniform and in lower case. Here are
some example uses:

  @editorconfig{{
    definitionsAtLastRun: `
      use context starter2024
      text("Hello!", 200, "purple")
    `,
    editorContents: `
      use context starter2024
      text("Hello!", 200, "purple")
    `
  }}

  @imageconfig{images/snowmanpuzzle2.png}

  @videoconfig{videos/eye.mov}

If a page content doesn't mention either of these, they inherit
them from the just-previous page.

The starting default used is

  @editorconfig{{}}

== Conditional text

Two conditional directives are available to exclusively enable or
disable content from the book pages:

  @ifselfguided{...}

uses the enclosed context for the book but nothing else, whereas

  @ifnotselfguided{...}

uses the enclosed context for everything but the book.

Note these can only be used for texts within slides, and cannot be
used to enclose `@slidebreak`. To conditionally allow or disallow
entire slide texts in the book, use `@selfguidedbreak` and
`@slideonlybreak`, described above.
