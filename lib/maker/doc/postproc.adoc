==  Postprocessing

When the Racket preprocessing and the Asciidoctor runs complete,
we have a bunch of `+.cached/*.html+` files in our `distribution`
tree. It would be nice if these were all there is to it, but
there is still a bunch of post-processing left. We use the other
`$ADOC_POSTPROC_*` files to guide this post-processing.

For starters, the `+.cached/*.html+` files need to go up one
directory, so they sit alongside their source `.adoc` files in
the `distribution` tree. (We may later choose to delete the `.adoc`
files before deployment to the website, but that's a different
matter.) In particular, we need to ensure that the final HTML
file has extension `.shtml` when it's a lesson plan or pathway
doc, either narrative or resources. It is `.html` in all other
cases, i.e., workbook pages and pathway-independent files.

The following are the components of the postprocessing:

-  CSS path correction:
When Asciidoctor is run on the `.asc` file, it enshrines a
pathname for `curriculum.css`. Make it relative to the HTML
location. (Unfortunately, Asciidoctor can't take a relative
pathname correctly from commandline when called on files that
aren't in the calling directory.)

- Boilerplate insertion.
Include links to various `*.css` and `*.js` files. Sometimes
conditionally: Codemirror-related links are included only if the
file has tags classed `pyret`, `racket`, or `circleevalsexp`.

-  Nested span and div insertion.
Asciidoctor lacks the ability to nest more than one level of div or span with specific
classes. The Racket preprocessor embeds markers for these so they
go through Asciidoctor verbatim. We can now scan for them and
replace them with divs/spans as appropriate.

- Remove intrusive spans in headers, add self-link to h2's

- Create Google-Drive versions

In general, it would be nice to reduce the amount of
postprocessing needed. However there are some limitations to how
much we can autoinsert during the preprocessing and
Asciidoctor-ing phases. View this purely as the unavoidable finishing
touch. Hopefully we can reduce this with time.
