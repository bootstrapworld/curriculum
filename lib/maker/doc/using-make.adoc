== Using the Makefile

The `Makefile` in the top directory allows to you build the
documentation system. Simply type `make`: This creates or updates the
`distribution` subdirectory with the various files
needed for the user.

You may also set a small number of environment variables on the
`make` command-line to further guide the build. These variable
settings may be combined.

=== PDF and workbook generation

By default, `make` won't create the PDF versions of the HTML files, nor the
collections of them that form the various workbooks. PDF and
workbook construction can be time-consuming and so is best
relegated to the final run, when the author is sure that the HTML
conversions have been thoroughly debugged. Once they are, and the
PDFs are desired, set the variable `BOOK` at the `make` command
line to a nonempty string, e.g.,

    make BOOK=yes

=== Link checking

By default, the checking of the various internal and external
links in the documents are not checked -- because it can be a
time-consuming process. (External-link checking is particularly
heinous because it takes a long while for each URL probe to return.)

To enable link checking, set the `LINKCHECK` variable to
nonempty, e.g.,

    make LINKCHECK=yes

It is often advisable to do the link check just for its own sake,
and only once in a while,
after the distribution dir is already in place from a previous
`make`.

=== Dependency graph generation

By default, no dependency graph is generated. To generate one at
`distribution/en-us/dependency-graph.js`, set the `GRAPH`
variable to nonempty, e.g.,

    make GRAPH=yes

The dependency graph shows how the various lessons depend on one
another.

=== Making from scratch

To remove a previously made distribution entirely, do

    make clean

The next `make` -- with whatever options you desire -- will be on
a fresh slate.

=== Deploying to website

To deploy a built distribution to the website, do

    make deploy

Deployment is described in more detail in the repo's README.
