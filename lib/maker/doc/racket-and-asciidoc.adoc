== Converting .adoc to .html

=== Racket preprocessor

After all the `$ADOC...` batch files have been populated, the
build runs a Racket preprocessor on the entries in
`$ADOCABLES_INPUT` to create the `.cached/*.asc` files.

This is because the .adoc files created by the curriculum authors
contains some directives in addition to the commands provided by
raw AsciiDoc. A Racket program preprocesses these away to create
a raw AsciiDoc file. This has the extension `.asc` and is
situated in a `.cached` subdir alongside the `.adoc` file penned
by the author.

The additional keyword values provided in the `$ADOCABLES_INPUT`
enables the Racket preprocessor to correctly address the
different types of .adoc files we have (workbook pages, lesson
plans, narratives, etc.).

A single Racket call is sufficient to process all the entries in
`$ADOCABLES_INPUT`.

==== Primitives used

When processing lesson files (whether lesson plan, work page, or
a file included by them), the primitives found in it are stored
in temp files in `.cached`. These become useful when creating
a collective description
of all the courses and lessons.

==== Exercise files

Special directives -- `@printable-exercise`,
`@opt-printable-exercise`, `@handout` -- are used to include
files within the lesson directory that are meant to be
_exercises_. Their names are stored in
`.cached/.lesson-exercises.txt.kp`.  Again these are useful for
the collective description.

=== Calling Asciidoctor

Once the Racket preprocessor done, we have a bunch of
`.cached/*.asc` files in the distribution, and the list of these
we have already captured in the file `$ADOC_INPUT`.

These files are now ready to be processed by Asciidoctor to
produce the corresponding .html.

The `asciidoctor` command can take a bunch of input files
as command-line input, however, given the number of files we're
processing, we will be exceeding the maximum-arg limit. We
therefore split the `$ADOC_INPUT` file into smaller files, each
of at most 100 entries, and we run `asciidoctor` separately on
these groups of 100.
