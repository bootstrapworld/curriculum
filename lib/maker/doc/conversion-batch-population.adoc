== Populating the conversion batch files

=== Pathway-independent files

The names of the pathway-independent .adoc files under
`distribution/en-us/textbooks` are collected.

The .adoc file, together with its `+#:containing-directory+` and
`+#:dist-root-dir+` value is added to `$ADOCABLES_INPUT`.

The .asc file (which sits in the `.cached` subdir), pathname
relative to `distribution/en-us` is added to `$ADOC_INPUT`.

The .html file (not yet postprocessed, sits in `.cached`),
pathname relative to `distribution/en-us`) is added to
`$ADOC_POSTPOC_PWYINDEP_INPUT`.

=== Workbook pages

We collect all
the workbook-page .adoc files and add them to
`$ADOCABLES_INPUT`. The `+#:containing-directory+`,
`+#:dist-root-dir+`, `+#:lesson+`, `+#:other-dir+`, `+#:solutions-mode?+`
and `+#:proglang+` values are included.

`+#:lesson+` is simply the
basename of the distribution lesson.

`+#:other-dir+` is a boolean
identifying if the file is simply meant for inclusion in other
adoc files and not for
full-scale conversion themselves. Such files are located in
subdirs named `fragments`, `xtra`, or `xtras`.

`+#:solution-mode?+` is a boolean set to true only for adoc files
in `solution-pages`. Such files contain information meant for
teachers but not students.

The .asc version of the file is added to `$ADOC_INPUT`.

The
cached .html version of the file is added ot
`$ADOC_POSTPROC_WORKBOOKPAGE_INPUT`.

=== Lesson-plan files

We collect all
the lesson-plan .adoc files and add them to
`$ADOCABLES_INPUT`. The `+#:containing-directory+`,
`+#:dist-root-dir+`, `+#:lesson-plan+`, `+#:proglang+`,
and `+#:other-proglangs+`
 values are included.

`+#:lesson-plan+` is simply the
basename of the distribution lesson.

`+#:other-proglangs+` is a list of the other proglangs for which
this lesson is available. This is used to have the lesson plan
include links to the plans for the same lesson in the other
proglangs.

The .asc version of the file is added to `$ADOC_INPUT`.

The
cached .html version of the file is added ot
`$ADOC_POSTPROC_LESSONPLAN_INPUT`.

=== Pathway resource files

Collect all the .adoc files _except_ the narrative file and add
them to `$ADOCABLES_INPUT`.  Other values included:
`+#:containing-directory+`, `#dist-root-dir`, `+#:other-dir+`,
`+#:resources+`, `+#:target-pathway+`, `+#:solutions-mode?+`,
`+#:proglang+`.

`+#:resources+` is set to true.

`+#:target-pathway+` is the (base) name of the course directory
(with the proglang suffix, if any).

The .asc file is added to `$ADOC_INPUT`.

The cached .html file is added to
`$ADOC_POSTPROC_RESOURCES_INPUT`.

=== Pathway narrative files

Collect all the narrative .adoc files in the distribution and add
then to `$ADOCABLES_INPUT`. Other values included:
`+#:containing-directory+`, `+#:dist-root-dir+`, `+#:narrative+`,
`+#:target-pathway+`, `+#:proglang+`, `+#:other-proglangs+`.

`+#:narrative+` is set to true.

`+#:other-proglangs+` is the list of other proglangs for which this
course is available, so they can link to each other.

The .asc file is added to `$ADOC_INPUT`.

The cached .html file is added to
`$ADOC_POSTPROC_NARRATIVE_INPUT`.

We also the .asc file for the pathway glossary (this is generated
by the Racket preprocessor) to `$ADOC_INPUT`. _Its_ cached .html
file is added to `$ADOC_POSTPROC_NARRATIVEAUX_INPUT`.
