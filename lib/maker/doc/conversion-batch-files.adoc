== Batch files for HTML conversion

The next stage of the build creates batch files that enshrine
enough information to the converters. We do not simply drill down
the distribution tree and convert the .adoc files immediately, as
that would be too inefficient, given the converters have
significant startup time. Instead, we create the batch
files in `distribution/en-us/.cached` so the conversions can be
done in one go. The names of these batch files are given by the
following environment variables (which are set in the build
makefile):

  $ADOCABLES_INPUT
  $ADOC_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_LESSONPLAN_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_NARRATIVEAUX_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_NARRATIVE_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_RESOURCES_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_PWYINDEP_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_WORKBOOKPAGE_INPUT
  $PUPPETEER_INPUT
  $EXERCISE_COLLECTOR_INPUT
  $COURSES_LIST_FILE
  $LESSONS_LIST_FILE

(The actual names used are not germane to this discussion.)

=== $ADOCABLES_INPUT

The `$ADOCABLES_INPUT` file has entries for each adoc file that
are given to the Racket preprocessor.
Each entry is of the form:

  ("<adoc-filename>" #:containing-directory <string>
                     #:dist-root-dir <string>
                     #:lesson-plan <string>
                     #:lesson <string>
                     #:otherdir <boolean>
                     #:resources <boolean>
                     #:solutions-mode? <boolean>
                     #:proglang <string>
                     #:other-proglangs <list>
                     #:narrative <boolean>
                     #:target-pathway <string>)

Not all the keywords are necessary for all the adoc files.

The `<adoc-filename>` is the basename of the adoc file. The
`+#:containing-directory+` value is given relative to
`distribution/en-us`. The `+#:dist-root-dir+` value is the
pathname of `distribution/en-us` relative to the adoc file. These
three values are not optional.

[discrete]
=== $ADOC_INPUT

This contains a list of `.asc` files, which are intermediate
files created by the Racket preprocessor from the `.adoc` files
listed in `$ADOCABLES_INPUT` before eventual conversion by
AsciiDoctor into HTML.

These `.asc` files are always inside a
`.cached` subdir co-level with the original `.adoc`. The pathnames of
these `.asc` files are given relative to `distribution/en-us`.

The HTML files created by AsciiDoctor also
reside in the `.cached` subdir and go through a postprocessing
phase before moving to the directory above.

[discrete]
=== $ADOC_POSTPROC_*_INPUT

These are the files

  $ADOC_POSTPROC_LESSONPLAN_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_NARRATIVEAUX_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_NARRATIVE_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_RESOURCES_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_PWYINDEP_INPUT
  $ADOC_POSTPROC_WORKBOOKPAGE_INPUT

These list the names of the HTML files awaiting postprocessing.
They are given in six lots, because the type of postprocessing
varies for:

- lesson plan HTML files
- glossary HTML files in courses
- pathway narrative HTML files
- pathway resource HTML files (i.e., pathway files other than the
  narrative)
- pathway-independent HTML files (neither lessons nor pathways)
- workbook HTML files (in the lessons)

The filenames in these files are relative to `distribution/en-us`.

[discrete]
=== $PUPPETEER_INPUT

This is a JSON file containing the list of postprocessed HTML
files that are ready to be converted to PDF.

[discrete]
=== *_LIST_FILE

These are:

  $COURSES_LIST_FILE
  $LESSONS_LIST_FILE

These contain the list of all the courses and lessons
respectively. While they can be obtained by listing the
concerned subdirs in `distribution/`, they are used often enough
that it is useful to cache these values.
