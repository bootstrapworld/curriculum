== The distribution layout

The _built_ version of a pathway -- called a _course_ -- is
created in a subdirectory called `courses` under the
`distribution` subdir. The built version of a lesson -- we'll
call it the _distribution lesson_ -- is similarly created in a
subdir called `lessons`, also under the `distribution` suddir.

=== The distribution subdir

The `courses` and `lessons` are not direct subdirs of
`distribution`, in order to accommodate different versions of
pathways and lessons based on the natlang used. To effect this,
the `distribution` has subdirs for each natlang (called `en-us`,
`es-mx`, etc.), and it is in the `courses` and `lessons` subdirs of
these that we find the natlang-specific courses and lessons.
Thus, the two natlang versions of the pathway `core` are laid out
as follows:

  distribution/
  |—— en-us/
  |   `—— courses/
  |       `—— core/
  `—— es-mx/
      `—— courses/
          `—— core/

Note that we use the same name `core` for the two natlang
versions in the distribution. We can do this because they reside
inside two different subtrees `distribution/en-us`
`distribution/es-mx` and thus don't risk a name clash.

As with pathways, so with lessons: To accommodate multiple
natlangs, the lessons go into the `lessons` subdir of their
natlang. E.g., for the lesson `simple-data-types`, we have:

  distribution/
  |—— en-us/
  |   `—— lessons/
  |       `—— simple-data-types/
  `—— es-mx/
      `—— lessons/
          `—— simple-data-types/

In the following, we will assume the prevailiing natural language is
`en-us`, so we will restrict our attention to the
`distribution/en-us` subtree. For other natlangs, the setup is exactly the same but in
the appropriate natlang-based subtree.

Also, we will call `distribution/en-us/courses/core` the course
root directory (of the English version of the `core` pathway).
The dir `distribution/en-us/lessons/simple-date-types` is the
distribution lesson root directory (of the English version of the
`simple-data-types` lesson).

=== Proglang associated with a course

Typically -- as seen in the above example -- the built names of the
pathway and the lesson are the same as their names in the source,
but not always.

By default, the programming language associated with a course is
`pyret`. This is marked in the course root directory as the 0-length
file `.cached/.proglang-pyret`.  (I.e.,
`distribution/en-us/courses/core/.cached/.proglang-pyret`.)

But we as have seen, a pathway may have a `proglang.txt` listing
a different or multiple proglangs.

Thus, for the pathway `core`,  two different courses are created in
`distribution/en-us/courses`. We continue to use the unadorned
pathway name, `core`, for the Pyret version. For other proglangs,
the course dir's name uses the proglang as a hyphenated suffix.
Thus for the WeScheme version, the course is entitled
`core-wescheme`. I.e., the two course root directories for `core` are

  distribution/en-us/courses/core
  distribution/en-us/courses/core-wescheme

These two directories have their own proglang marker files, i.e.,
`.cached/.proglang-pyret` (as before) and
`.cached/.proglang-wescheme`.

We often have pathways whose `proglang.txt` contains only a single
proglang, but that proglang isn't Pyret.  E.g., the pathway
`shipwrecks` whose `proglang.txt` contains only `spreadsheets`.
In such a case, the built course is simply called `shipwrecks`
rather than `shipwrecks-spreadsheets`, since there is no Pyret
version to distinguish it from.

=== Proglang associated with a distribution lesson

As with pathways, lessons can be in different proglangs, also
specified with `proglang.txt`. If no `proglang.txt` is present,
the (single) proglang is assumed to be `pyret`.  The distribution
version of the non-Pyret lessons have the proglang as hyphenated
suffix, e.g.,

  simple-data-types-wescheme

Again, as with pathways, a proglang-marker file
`.cached/.proglang-wesceme` is placed in the distribution lesson
root to identify it as a lesson using `wescheme`.

Note that the pathway mentions in its `lesson-order.txt` the
lesson names in unadorned form (no proglang suffix). On building, a pathway becomes a
course, and the distribution lessons associated with it are the
right versions corrected for proglang. Thus the pathway `core`
has `simple-data-types` as a constituent lesson. Moving over to
the built `distribution`, the course `core` (Pyret) includes the lesson
`simple-data-types` (Pyret), and the course `core-wescheme`
includes the lesson `simple-data-types-wescheme`.

=== The course narrative and other resources

The pathway narrative `index.adoc` in the pathway root eventually
will get
converted to `index.shtml` in the course root. The various .adoc
files in the `front-matter`, `back-matter` and `resources`
subdirs also will get converted to HTML files, with suffix `.shtml` at
the top level and `.html` at lower depths, i.e., in any `pages`
and `solution-pages` subdirs. However, these HTML conversions
aren't performed at this time. 

=== The lesson plan and workbook pages

The lesson plan `index.adoc` in the lesson root eventually will
get converted to
`index.shtml` in the distribution lesson root.

The .adoc files in the `pages/` and `solution-pages/` subdirs
along with any .adoc files they include will get converted to `.html`
files alongside.

=== Pathway-independent files

The pathway-independent files in `shared/langs/en-us/docroot` are
copied over to `distribution/en-us`.
