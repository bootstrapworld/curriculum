== PDFs and Workbooks

A course has six types of workbooks. The student-facing workbooks
are in the `workbook/` subdir of the course, while the
teacher-facing ones are in `resources/protected` (and are, as the
dir name suggests, password-protected).

The workbooks are a concatenation of pages.

Most of the workbook pages are from a course's constituent
lessons, and these are listed in the lesson's
`pages/workbook-pages.txt`.
In addition, a course's workbook may include front and back
matter, which are specified within the pathway dir itself. Some
workbooks may contain exercise pages, which are referred to be
the lesson plan, are present in the lesson's `pages/` dir, but
not listed in its `workbook-pages.txt`.

=== Creating page PDFs

The script `make-pdf.sh` passes the list of HTML files generated in
`$PUPPETEER_INPUT` to the Node program `html2pdf.js`, creating
the corresponding PDFs.

=== Workbooks

The program `make-workbook-jsons.lua` scans the course and lesson
dirs for various temp files create the previous portions of the
build to create JSON files that list the constituent PDFs for
each type of workbook.

The script `make-books.sh` uses these JSON files to create the
final workbook PDFs.
