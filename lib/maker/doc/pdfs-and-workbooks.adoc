== PDFs and Workbooks

A course has six types of workbooks.

Each workbook is a concatenation of pages.

Most of the workbook pages are from the course's constituent
lessons, and these are listed in the lesson's
`pages/workbook-pages.txt`.
In addition, a course's workbook may include front and back
matter, which are specified within the pathway dir itself. Some
workbooks may contain exercise pages, which are referred to in
the lesson plan, are present in the lesson's `pages/` dir, but
not listed in its `workbook-pages.txt`.

The three student-facing workbooks
are in the `workbook/` subdir of the course:

  workbook.pdf
  workbook-long.pdf
  opt-exercises.pdf

The `workbook.pdf` contains the basic lesson pages. The `-long`
version includes the optional exercises referred to in the lesson
plans. The `opt-` version contains just the exercises.

The three teacher-facing workbooks are named similarly but for
the `-sols` suffix, and
reside in the `resources/protected` subdir, which is
password-protected:

  workbook-sols.pdf
  workbook-long-sols.pdf
  opt-exercises-sols.pdf

=== Creating page PDFs

The script `make-pdf.sh` passes the list of HTML files generated in
`$PUPPETEER_INPUT` to the Node program `html2pdf.js`, creating
the corresponding PDFs.

=== Workbooks

The program `make-workbook-jsons.lua` scans the course and lesson
dirs for various temp files create the previous portions of the
build to create JSON files that list the constituent PDFs for
each type of workbook.

The script `make-books.sh` uses these JSON files to create the
final workbook PDFs.
