<p>Title (or level-1) header is preceded by a single equal sign. In
the following, AsciiDoc is the writing format that you use.
Asciidoctor is the program used to convert it to HTML, PDF, etc.
The repo build script(s) should take care of this.</p>

<p>And so on: The <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual">online
Asciidoctor manual</a> has the whole story. Learn just the bare
minimum to start writing, and learn as needed, either from the
online manual, or by bugging me. (If something seems too tedious
to learn, I can also add it as a Racket directive as described
below.)</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_racket_preproc_for_directives">Racket preproc for directives</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Racket-based preprocessor converts metadata and other
directives within the document to appropriate AsciiDoc commands.
These directives are words preceded by @.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>@<code>vocab{&#8230;&#8203;}</code> is used to annotate a glossary item. The master
glossary list is in <code>lib/glossary-terms.rkt</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>E.g., @<code>vocab{definitions window}</code> will generate a glossary
entry for “definitions window”. The glossary is included at the
head of the current document. It also goes into a summarizing
glossary in a separate document that gathers together all the
glossary items from files in the working directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>@<code>std{&#8230;&#8203;}</code> is used to specify standards. The master list of
standards is in <code>lib/standards-dictionary</code>. You can specify
multiple standards with comma separation. You can also add
subitem numbers to each standard. The standards specified in a
doc are included at the head (just after the glossary). Subitems,
if present, only become visible when you hover over the main
standard item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More directives tuned to our curriculum needs coming up: viz.,
materials needed, preparations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will also include directives to simply abbreviate any tedious
AsciiDoc specifications that authors don’t need to specify over
and over. For example,
tables are enclosed in lines with <code>|===</code>, and cells are separated
by <code>|</code>. Before the opening
<code>|===</code> a table spec in brackets tells how many columns there are
and how to style them. I’ve provided two directives
@<code>lesson-table</code>
and @<code>standards-table</code> for two specific types of tables common in
curricula. More can be added as needed.</p>
