# There are EIGHT "mystery tables" defined: tableA, tableB...tableH. 

# 1a) Click Run and type table1 into the interactions area.

# 1b) Decide whether or not you think it represents a linear relationship.
#     - If you think it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?
#     - If you don't think it's linear, what tipped you off?

# 1c) Try to imagine what it might look like.
#     - Type "table-to-graph(tableA)" and check your prediction.


# 2-8 Evaluate the rest of the tables by typing their names into the interactions area and repeating the process described for #1.
