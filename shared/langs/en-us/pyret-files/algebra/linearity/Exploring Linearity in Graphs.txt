# There are TEN "mystery graphs" defined: graphA,graphB...graphJ. 

# 1)  Click Run and type "show(graphA) in the interactions area to see the graph. 
# 1a) You can mouse-over any point in the graph to see the (x,y) coordinates!
# 1b) Is graphA linear or non-linear?
# 1c) If it's linear, is the slope positive, negative or zero?
# 1d) If it's linear, what is the y-intercept? (you may have to estimate for some graphs.)

# 2-10) Repeat this process for graphB to graphJ.
