# DEFINITIONS - LINEAR OR NOT?
# There are TEN "mystery definitions" in this file called funA,
# funB, funC,...funJ. Click Run and evaluate them in
# the interactions area, using them with inputs

# For example: type "funB(-5)" to see what funB will produce when x = -5

# HINT 1: you can represent each relationship as a table,
# by evaluating "def-to-table(funA)" in the interactions area

# HINT 2: you can represent each relationship as a graph,
# by evaluating "def-to-graph(funA)" in the interactions area

# 1a) Is funA linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 1b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 2a) Is funB linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 2b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 3a) Is funC linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 3b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 4a) Is funD linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 4b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 5a) Is funE linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 5b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 6a) Is funF linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 6b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 7a) Is funG linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 7b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 8a) Is funH linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 8b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 9a) Is funI linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 9b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# 10a) Is funJ linear, non-linear, or not a relationship at all?
# 10b) If it's linear, what is the slope and y-intercept?

# WRITING EXAMPLES
# For each of the functions you found that express a linear 
# relationship, write *two examples* for that function, representing
# two points on the graph or two rows in the table.

# We've done one of them for you:
examples "funB":
  funB(10) is 20
  funB(11) is 42
