   )
  ("6-8.Data and Analysis.Collection"
   "People design algorithms and tools to automate the collection of data by computers. When data collection is automated, data is sampled and converted into a form that a computer can process. For example, data from an analog sensor must be converted into a digital form. The method used to automate data collection is influenced by the availability of tools and the intended use of the data."
   )
  ("9-12.Data and Analysis.Storage"
   "Data can be composed of multiple data elements that relate to one another. For example, population data may contain information about age, gender, and height. People make choices about how data elements are organized and where data is stored. These choices affect cost, speed, reliability, accessibility, privacy, and integrity."
   )
  ("6-8.Data and Analysis.Storage"
   "Applications store data as a representation. Representations occur at multiple levels, from the arrangement of information into organized formats (such as tables in software) to the physical storage of bits. The software tools used to access information translate the low-level representation of bits into a form understandable by people."
   )
  ("9-12.Data and Analysis.Visualization and Transformation"
   "Data can be transformed to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process."
   )
  ("6-8.Data and Analysis.Visualization and Transformation"
   "Computer models can be used to simulate events, examine theories and inferences, or make predictions with either few or millions of data points. Computer models are abstractions that represent phenomena and use data and algorithms to emphasize key features and relationships within a system. As more data is automatically collected, models can be refined."
   )
  ("9-12.Data and Analysis.Inference and Models"
   "The accuracy of predictions or inferences depends upon the limitations of the computer model and the data the model is built upon. The amount, quality, and diversity of data and the features chosen can affect the quality of a model and ability to understand a system. Predictions or inferences are tested to validate models."
