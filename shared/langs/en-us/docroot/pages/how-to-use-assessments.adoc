Bootstrap is a research-based project, which means we're constantly evaluating our materials and impact on student learning. The benefit to teachers - besides piece of mind - is that we put a fair amount of effort into the assessments and tools we use.

@vspace{1ex}

*Starting in 2025, we began to develop "Show What You Know" assessments that teachers could use with their students.* This document outlines the design goals of those assessments, how your students' data is protected, and how to use the assessments.

== Design Goals for Assessments

- If a lesson claims to teach concept XYZ, it should include an assessment of XYZ
- Start with assessments for our most-used lessons, and add new assessments each year
- Give teachers an easy way to see results for their class as a whole, and for each individual student
- NEVER gather personally-identifiable information about students
- Improve quality of Bootstrap materials through continuous data-gathering

== Giving Students an Assessment

Lessons that include assessments will list them in the *Assessments* row of the summary table at the top (see link:../lessons/box-plots-interpret/[Box Plots: Interpreting Spread, window="_blank"]).

- Make sure you are logged into your teacher account at link:https://www.BootstrapWorld.org[https://www.BootstrapWorld.org, window="_blank"]. _Assessments will not work unless they can be linked to your teacher account!_
- Click the button (@image{../lib/images/quizLinkIcon.png, 16}) next to the assessment title in the lesson plan and type the name of your class or group (e.g. - "Period 2", "Algebra 1", "Students who missed the midterm"). When you press "Enter", a link will appear with the name you chose.
- Copy and save the link to share with your students. _It will disappear the next time you load the page. Note: as long as you remember the name, you can always regenerate the same link by re-entering the same name._

- Share the link with the relevant group of students (via email, Google Classroom, etc.). _Note: The link will expire after 14 days._ 
- *Students must enter a short ID when taking the assessment*, which only *YOU* can use to identify them! _We recommend the first two letters of their first and last name, their studentID number, a special code you create with them, etc. Make sure this ID does not include their full name, email address, or any other personally-identifiable information (PII)!_

== Getting Assessment Results

- *You will receive an automated email* around 5am EST summarizing the past 24 hours' submissions for each group and each assessment accessed that day. For example: if you gave the same assessmentto 3 classes, you'll receive 3 different emails; if you gave two assessments to one class, you'll receive 2 different emails. Each email will include a summary of the group as a whole, followed by data on individual question and student.
- Remember: these results will only be identified by the student ID you use! You'll have to connect the scores back to the individual students. _Assessment data is stored on our server alongside student's (non-PII) ID, the name of the group you created, and an anonymous identifier that connects them to you as their teacher._

== Retrieving Old Assessments

Ever lost an important email? We have too! If you need to retrieve old assessment data go to *Link TBD*, and enter the start and end dates for window of data you want to retrieve and you'll receive an automated email around 5am EST.  For example:

- If you want to get access to just yesterday's assessment, you'd use yesterday's date for both the start and end date. 
- If you gave an assessment to four sections of students every day between 2/4/26 and 2/6/26, you should expect to get (4 classes × 3 days) 12 of these emails.
