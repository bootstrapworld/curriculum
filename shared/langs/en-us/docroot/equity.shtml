            <h1>Our Approach to Equity</h1>
            <p>
            As one of the largest providers of in-school computer and data science curricula, we're proud that <strong>nearly 46% of our students self-identify as underrepresented minority groups, and 47% identify as girls and young women</strong>. Equity is at the heart of our operations at Bootstrap, impacting everything from our approach to scaling, curriculum design, pedagogy, and software engineering. Here's how we consider equity in our approach to each of these program elements.
            </p>

            <h2>Scaling Model</h2>
            <p>
                By focusing on <i>integration</i>, Bootstrap allows schools to scale computer science without finding room in the budget for a new teacher, or room in the schedule for a new class. And by tying our CS content to the well-defined learning goals of the host subject (e.g. - algebra, physics, etc), we can be <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sfk-bsa-scaff-unscaff-wp/">rigorous and explicit</a> about our outcomes. Finally, by leveraging the teachers who already reach every child, <strong>we can reach CSforAll at a fraction of the time and cost.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2>Curriculum Design</h2>
                Merely putting a curriculum in front of all students doesn't achieve equity. We use a number of mechanisms to make out content as inclusive as possible:
            <ul>
                <li>Our curricular materials are designed to be relevant and inclusive for a wide range of students. Our curriculum is filled with projects that are tailored to student interests, such as <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/skf-creativity-bootstrap/">creating a personalized video game</a>, <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/lessons/flags/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret">coding a flag</a>, or conducting  original research on one of our <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/lessons/choosing-your-dataset/index.shtml#Datasets">ready-to-use datasets</a> on a relevant topic ranging from politics to sports, entertainment, health and the environment. 
                </li>

                <li>All of our curricular materials - lesson plans, exit slips, homework assignments, projects, rubrics, slides, and more - are <i>completely free</i>.

                <li>Not every student has a computer - or even internet access! - at home. That's why our materials include a pencil-and-paper workbook, which allows students to practice their skills even if they're not in front of the keyboard. The materials are available as free PDFs.</li>

                <li>We include <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/lessons/computing-needs-all-voices/">diverse representations of mathematicians and computing pioneers</a> in our materials.
                </li>

                <li>We choose real-world examples and use names that represent the diversity of our students.</li>

                <li>We recently conducted an internal audit of our curriculum, using
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/sites/default/files/2017-06/TT_Social_Justice_Standards_0.pdf">The Social Justice Standards</a>, an anti-bias framework from Learning for Justice</li>
                        <li>"Assessing Bias in Standards and Curricular Materials" framework</li>
                        <li><a href="https://equitablemath.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/1_STRIDE1.pdf">A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction: Dismantling Racism in Mathematics Instruction</a></li>
                    </ul>
                This audit helped us to identify and prioritize the need for new lessons, additional scaffolds and expanded activities which we've been working to address as part of our ongoing release cycle.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
            <p>
                Inclusive and culturally-relevant pedagogy is critical to creating a healthy classroom environment, and there's no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all approach. We employ a variety of pedagogical strategies to support students from diverse backgrounds and with different abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pedagogical techniques we use (e.g., Circles of Evaluation, Contracts, Design Recipe, Notice &amp; Wonder) are designed with structure in mind, so that every student has a set of strategies they can try before "giving up" and asking the teacher to get them unstuck.</li>

                    <li>Teamwork and collaboration are used throughout the curriculum, with explicit scaffolds and structures in place for students to work together and support one another. Programming is done in pairs, with many unplugged activities designed for groups of 2-5. Students switch between roles, giving them multiple opportunities to excel and grow.</li>

                    <li>We use real-world issues that affect the students in our classrooms, with support for teachers to tailor their examples and projects to things that are relevant to their students.</li>

                    <li>Scaffolds for class discussions provide opportunities for students to share diverse points of view, interpretations, and lived experiences.</li>

                    <li>Many of our techniques are intentionally designed to interrupt practices that negatively impact vulnerable and marginalized students. For example, our pedagogy explicitly refers back to prior work that students have done. This encourages students to use their prior success to get to them through current struggles, and reinforces the idea that they have multiple ways to think their way through a problem before relying on the teacher. These references can be found in the "contracts reference page" at the back of every student workbook, and which teachers are trained to use when redirecting student questions. Another example is our focus on a structured approach to solving word problems, where each step provides a scaffold for the step to follow.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Professional Development</h2>
            <p>
                In a field that recieves <i>so much</i> funding from grants and Silicon Valley, we believe that cost should never be a barrier for schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that the teacher in the classroom is more valuable than the textbooks, and that value guides our own pricing. We give all of our "textbooks" away in the form of free curricular materials, but we charge for PD to pay our fulltime staff. In fact, that's the <i>only</i> thing we charge for! And for partners who find the professional development cost to be an obstacle, we've worked to raise grant or foundation funds to support training teachers.
            </p>

            <h2>Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                At Bootstrap, we've invested extraordinary resources in building tools with <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/blog/software/Errors.shtml">helpful error messages</a>, and <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-measur-effect-error-msg-novice-sigcse/">published</a> <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-mind-lang-novice-inter-error-msg/">research</a> <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-measur-effect-error-msg-novice/">to help</a> <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/wk-error-msg-classifier/">others</a> do the same. For students who don't yet identify as programmers, an inscrutable error message can be the sign that they "don't belong".  Our error messages empower students to be independent problem solvers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Equity also means considering the needs of differently-abled students. We've made our tools <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/blog/accessibility/User-Interface-REPL.shtml">screenreader-accessible</a>, and have begun providing alternate styling for students with different types of color-blindness. As with our error messages, we've also worked to publish the results from these efforts (<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sbk-accessible-ast-blocks/">SIGCSE 2019</a>, <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sbk-adap-stud-ide-blind-prog/">Koli Calling, 2020</a>) so that others can learn from our experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>
                For most schools, downloaded software or subscription fees represent a serious barrier to equity! <strong>That's why all of our tools are 100% free, and require no download or installation.</strong>
