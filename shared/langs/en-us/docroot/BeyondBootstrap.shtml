                <h1>After Bootstrap</h1> If you've completed the entire Bootstrap curriculum, you'll be happy to know that your class can move on to advanced material, without needing to learn a new language! Here are just a few of the options available to Bootstrap teachers:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://dcic-world.org">A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing</a> is a full textbook that uses a data-first approach to computing, blending <i>computing with data</i>, <i>data science</i>, and <i>data structures</i>. Bootstrap students who've completed any of our courses in Pyret can start right away, scaling up through <b>college level computer science and bridging to Python!</b></li>
                    <li><a href="http://picturingprograms.com/">Picturing Programs</a> focuses heavily on images and animation, as students explore recursion, lists, trees and algorithms -- all using the same language and Design Recipe they've learned in Bootstrap.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/">How to Design Programs</a> is a textbook aimed at more college-level audiences, going beyond the material covered in Picturing Programs. HtDP is currently in its second edition, and the material is being actively updated.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="item one-half">
                <img src="/images/htdw-v1.jpg" class="item_img">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix">
            <div class="item bottom-border">
                <a class="anchor" id="software"></a>
                <img src="/images/drschemeshot.jpg" class="item_img" style="float: right; width: 300px;">
                <h1>Software</h1> Bootstrap uses <a href="https://www.wescheme.org">WeScheme</a> and <a href="http://code.pyret.org">Pyret</a>, cloud-based IDEs that require <b>no downloading or installation</b>. Anyone with a Gmail account can start coding, storing and retrieving files from the cloud. Bootstrap programs can be shared simply by sending out a link, or posting it to sites such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
                <p/> No internet access? Bootstrap also supports <a href="http://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a>, a multi-platform graphical environment. DrRacket runs on all major platforms (Windows, OS X, Unix/Linux) and programs written for one platform run seamlessly on the others, supporting a wide variety of classroom and home computing scenarios. Its emphasis on beginner-friendly features and support for images makes it ideal for Bootstrap.
                <p/>
                <h2>Accessibility</h2> A tool designed for learning should be accessible to <i>all</i> students. We work hard to ensure that our software environments are compatible with screen-readers on popular operating systems, and are a Development Partner of the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/accesscsforall">AccessCSforAll</a> Alliance.
