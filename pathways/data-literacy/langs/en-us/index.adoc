== Going Further

This pathway is designed to minimize the math and programming requirements, focusing primarily on data visualization, middle-school statistics, ethics and social impacts. If your students are ready for functions (typically delivered in 8th or 9th grade), lessons like @lesson-link{functions-make-life-easier} and @lesson-link{functions-examples-definitions} open up opportunities for *filtering rows* and *building columns*, or *advanced data visualizations*.

These lessons -- and much more -- are available in our full @dist-link{courses/data-science/, Data Science} pathway, which includes everything from Bootstrap:Data Literacy and builds to functions and advanced data science.

You can also _pick-and-choose the lessons you want_, using our @dist-link{customPathway.shtml} tool!
