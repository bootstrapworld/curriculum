= Learn to Build a Video Game!

This Bootstrap course engages students in building their own video game, while reinforcing foundational concepts in Algebra through meaningful applications:

- building their world using function composition
- animating characters through linear functions
- handling keypresses with piecewise functions
- detecting boundaries with compound inequalities
- and detecting collisions by calculating distance using the Pythagorean Theorem

Students have a chance to express their creativity through the design of a game context, choosing their own player (their avatar), a danger (something to avoid), and a target (something to chase). 

__The lessons outlined here are the ones considered **essential** for video game creation.__ In @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/algebra/, "Bootstrap:Algebra"} and @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/data-science/, "Bootstrap:Data Science"}, we offer many additional lessons where students can develop their math and coding skills.  We encourage you to integrate additional lessons that meet your students' needs.
