= Learn to Build a Video Game!

This Bootstrap course engages students in building their own video game, while reinforcing foundational concepts in Algebra through meaningful applications!

Students will:

- build their world using function composition
- animate characters through linear functions
- handle keypresses with piecewise functions
- detect boundaries with compound inequalities
- detect collisions by calculating distance using the Pythagorean Theorem

They will also have a chance to express their creativity through the design of a game context, choosing their own player (their avatar), a danger (something to avoid), and a target (something to chase). 

The lessons outlined below are the ones considered essential for video game creation. __A more detailed overview, including a student-facing rubric, can be found @lesson-link{project-video-game, here}.__ +

- ðŸŽ® indicates that a lesson is focus directly on the @starter-file{game, "Game Starter File"}. 
- The other lessons in the list are prerequisites for these lessons, in which students build the skills they'll need to work on various pieces of the game code. 

__In @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/algebra/, "Bootstrap:Algebra"} and @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/data-science/, "Bootstrap:Data Science"}, we offer many additional lessons where students can develop their math and coding skills.  We encourage you to integrate additional lessons that meet your students' needs!__
