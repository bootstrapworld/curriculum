_Usage Note: This rubric captures the typical case in which students progress from naming only the function correctly to also getting the number of inputs and input types correct. Teachers should feel free to adapt the rubric to appropriately score students who make a mistake in the function name but have the rest of the work correct._

| Contract 		
| The Contract is not left blank.
| Contract contains the correct function name. 
a| 
* Contract has the correct function name. 
* Contract has the correct number of Domain Data types. 
* Contract has the correct data type(s) listed for the Domain or Range.
a| 
* Contract contains the correct function name. 
* Contract has the correct number of Domain Data types.
* Contract has the correct data type(s) listed in the Domain.
* Contract has the correct  data type listed for the Range.
| Purpose Statement
| The Purpose Statement is not left blank.  
| The Purpose Statement describes what the function consumes or produces.
| The Purpose Statement describes what the function consumes and produces.
a| 
* The Purpose Statement describes what the function consumes and produces.
* The Purpose Statement describes how the  result is computed, so that it can be combined to with the Contract to completely explain their examples (e.g. “Battling”).
| Examples
| Examples are not left blank.
| All examples have the   correct function name. 
a| 
* All examples have the correct function name.
* The inputs differ across the examples, and are appropriate to the problem
a|
* All examples have the correct function name. 
* The inputs differ across the examples, and are appropriate to the problem.
* All examples have the correct number of Domain inputs. 
* There are correct expressions for what the function produces, using the different given inputs.  
* Changeable parts of the Examples are circled and labeled with a variable name and drawn from the purpose statement.  
* The Examples show how the result is computed, such that they can completely explain the Definitions (e.g. “Battling”).
* If cond is required, students write examples for each condition and can explain why a condition is necessary.
| Definition
| The Definition is not left blank.
| The Definition has the correct function name. 
| The Definition has the correct function name, correct number, name, and order of variables (taken from the labels in the Examples section). 
a| 
* The Definition has the correct function name, correct number, name, and order of variables (taken from the labels in the Examples section).
* The function body is consistent with the Examples.
* If cond is required, it contains conditions that properly satisfy all examples.
