== Overview
*Best data sets for wide-range of graphs without lots of effort:*

- States
- Movies
- Schools
- Countries

*Datasets requiring calculations to convert data before making graphs:*

- Schools
- Countries
- US Cancer Rates

*Datasets with a limited number of categories:*

- Police Traffic Stops
- Presidents
- Countries
- Sodas
- Movies

*Datasets with a huge number of columns*

- MLB
- U.S. Voter Turnout

*Datasets with fairly little quantitative data (well-suited to simpler analysis, not recommended for scatter plots):*

- Video games

== Tips for Specific Datasets

=== U.S. Voter Turnout 1986-2018
- This dataset looks at demographics of the electorate.  Information is provided on what percentage of the electorate each group represents and how turnout for elections varies across age, educational attainment and race.
- Column Titles: year, Turnout Rate 18-29, Turnout Rate 30-44, Turnout Rate 45-59, Turnout Rate 60+, Share of Electorate 18-29, Share of Electorate 30-44, Share of Electorate 45-59, Share of Electorate 60+, Turnout Rate Less Than High School, Turnout Rate High School Grad, Turnout RateSome College to College Grad, Turnout Rate Post-Graduate, Share of Electorate Less Than High School, Share of Electorate High School Grad, Share of Electorate Some College to College Grad, Share of Electorate Post-Graduate, Turnout Rate Non-Hispanic White, Turnout Rate Non-Hispanic Black, Turnout Rate Hispanic, Turnout Rate Other, Share of Electorate Non-Hispanic White, Share of Electorate Non-Hispanic Black, Share of Electorate Hispanic, Share of Electorate Other


=== 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections
- This dataset summarizes the 2016 presidential election by state.  We can see the margin of victory by which each state was one, which states disenfranchise voters for their felony status, how many people didn’t vote, how states allocate their electoral college delegates, etc.
- Column Titles: state, state abbreviation, voting-age population (VAP), votes cast for president, ineligible to vote: felon, ineligible to vote: non-citizen, who won?, margin of victory, eligible to vote & didn't, votes for candidates other than Clinton & Trump, electoral college votes for Trump, electoral college votes for Clinton, electoral college votes for candidates other than Clinton or Trump, total electoral college reps
- Have students 
* Define a function `pct-voted`, which computes the percent of the voting age population that voted for president.
* Define a function `pct-margin`, which computes the margin of victory as a percent of the voting age population.
* Define a function `pct-eligible` to vote, which computes the percent of the voting age population that is not disenfranchised by citizenship status or felony convictions.


=== R.I. Schools
- This is data from 271 Rhode Island public & charter schools.
- Column titles: District Name, School Name, % passing ELA in 2018, % passing Math in 2018, Charter School (yes/no?), Number of students free lunch eligible, Number of students reduced lunch eligible, Number of students by racial/ethnic group (American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, Black, White, 2 or more races), male, female, total population.
- Have students:
* Define a function `pct-black`, which computes the percent of black students at a school.
* Define a function `pct-hispanic`, which computes the percent of black students at a school. 
* Define a function `high-math`, which returns true if a school has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.
- *Heads up!*
* Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the number of students.  In order to compare between schools, percentages would need to be calculated.
* Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate quantities. Usually we combine these numbers as a measure of poverty (e.g. - "free or reduced lunch") for analysis.
* Outlier to be aware of: Classical High School


=== Police Traffic Stops, Durham, NC  2002-2013:
- This data set looks at how many traffic stops in Durham, NC between 2002 and 2013 resulted in searches of the person stopped. Data is broken down by age, race and sex. 
- Column Titles: group, age, race, sex, stops, searches
- Have students:
* Define a function `search-rate`, which computes the percent of stops that result in searches.


=== MLB Hitting Stats (2018)

- Have students:
* Define a function `pop-density`, which computes the people per square mile.
* Define a function `pct-change-pop`, which computes the percent change in the population from 2010 to 2014.


=== Movies
- 100 top-grossing movies (as of 2018) 
- Column titles: Rank, Movie Title, Studio Name, Female-lead, POC-lead, Total Gross Income (million dollars), Domestic Income (million $), Overseas Income (million $), Year
