= Teacher Resources for Data Science (CODAP)


== Let's Get Started

- **Online Community** [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org, Discourse}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share ideas!
- **Remote Instruction** [@dist-link{ImplementationNotes.shtml, link}] - specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.

== Projects

Projects allow exploration of data collected by students themselves or chosen from our library. The Bootstrap:Data Science in CODAP curriculum includes three mini projects, each designed to span 2-5 class periods. We also offer two multi-lesson, capstone projects.

**Mini Projects**

- @lesson-link{project-design-a-survey, "Design a Survey"} - Students practice collecting clean data.
- @lesson-link{project-infographic, "Make an Infographic"} - Students create their own infographics, thinking critically and creatively about ratio relationships.
- @lesson-link{project-threats, "When Data Science Goes Bad"} - Students pretend to be "bad data scientists", gaining awareness of how data can be misconstrued.

**Multi-Lesson, Capstone Projects**

- @lesson-link{project-data-exploration, "Dataset Exploration"} - Students explore a dataset of their choice, documenting their journey by creating a @starter-file{exploration-project, "slide deck"} of charts, statistics, and possbible research questions.

- @lesson-link{project-research-paper} - Using the research question they developed during the @lesson-link{project-data-exploration, "Dataset Exploration"}, students create a formal @starter-file{research-paper, "research paper"}, a @starter-file{research-project, "slide deck"}, or both.

== Dataset Library

Students can import their own data into CODAP or choose from one of the many provided datasets below:

@include{../../../lessons/choosing-your-dataset/fragments/dataset-table.adoc}

__We have compiled some @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.adoc, Notes on our provided datasets}, to help you decide which might be most useful in your classroom.__
