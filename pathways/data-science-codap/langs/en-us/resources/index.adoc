= Teacher Resources for Data Science

== Essentials
- *Online Community (Discourse)* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share out ideas!
- *Glossary* [@link{../../../Glossary.shtml?pathway=data-science-codap, link}] - All of the vocabulary words (and their definitions) used in this pathway.
- *Bilingual Glossary of Bootstrap Terms (English-Spanish)* [@link{../../../lib/bilingual-glossary.html, PDF}] - For teachers with ELL/ESL students, we provide a bilingual glossary for all of the terms used across our curriculum library.

== Projects

Projects allow exploration of data collected by students themselves or chosen from our library. The Bootstrap:Data Science in CODAP curriculum includes three mini projects, each designed to span 2-5 class periods. We also offer two multi-lesson, capstone projects.

**Mini Projects**

- @lesson-link{project-design-a-survey, "Design a Survey"} - Students practice collecting clean data.
- @lesson-link{project-infographic, "Make an Infographic"} - Students create their own infographics, thinking critically and creatively about ratio relationships.
- @lesson-link{project-threats, "When Data Science Goes Bad"} - Students pretend to be "bad data scientists", gaining awareness of how data can be misconstrued.

**Multi-Lesson, Capstone Projects**

- @lesson-link{project-data-exploration, "Dataset Exploration"} - Students explore a dataset of their choice, documenting their journey by creating a @starter-file{exploration-project, "slide deck"} of charts, statistics, and possbible research questions.

- @lesson-link{project-research-paper} - Using the research question they developed during the @lesson-link{project-data-exploration, "Dataset Exploration"}, students create a formal @starter-file{research-paper, "research paper"}, a @starter-file{research-project, "slide deck"}, or both.
