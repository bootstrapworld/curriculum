= Teacher Resources for Data Science

== Essentials
- *Online Community (Discourse)* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share out ideas!
- *Glossary* [@link{../../../Glossary.shtml?pathway=data-science-codap, link}] - All of the vocabulary words (and their definitions) used in this pathway.
- *Bilingual Glossary of Bootstrap Terms (English-Spanish)* [@link{../../../lib/bilingual-glossary.html, PDF}] - For teachers with ELL/ESL students, we provide a bilingual glossary for all of the terms used across our curriculum library.

== Starter Files
Many of our lessons have their own starter files, linked from the materials section of each lesson plan. Below is a collated list of all the starter files from across the curriculum.

- @starter-file{animals}
- @starter-file{fair-coins}
- @starter-file{expanded-animals}

== Projects
Working in pairs, students complete different projects as they explore their own datasets. These datasets can be collected by students themselves, or chosen from our library.

@all-projects

**Multi-Lesson, Capstone Projects**

- *Exploration Paper* - Students begin by exploring their dataset, generating charts and coming up with possible research questions. The end product is the @starter-file{exploration-paper}. You can find the description of this project (and the grading rubric!) at @lesson-link{project-exploration-paper/, the Exploration Paper page}.

== Resources that Pair Well with Bootstrap:Data Science

- @link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's Going on in this Graph?} - weekly intriguing data visualizations by the New York Times

- @link{https://pudding.cool/, The Pudding} - fascinating, data-rich visual essays explaining ideas debated in culture

- @link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/t/something-fun-for-the-classroom-hownotto/1459/9, How Not To} - friendly potshots at terrible Data Science, regularly posted to social media under the hashtag "HowNotTo"

- @link{https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs, Same Stats, Different Graphs} - an illustration from Autodesk of why we must see the shape of data and not just focus on the descriptive statistics

- @link{http://guessthecorrelation.com/, Guess the Correlation} - a game-ified resource (built by Omar Wagih) for building intuition for correlation, based on randomly-generated scatterplots

- @link{https://www.geogebra.org/m/ZcVIxKtF, Sensitive r} - an applet from Geogebra that shows how changing a single point can change the correlation coefficient `r`

== Other Facilitation Resources
- *Homework Submission Template* [@link{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfj24nCBA18zvjK19OwS_DZfwFZpHoPtPcd-2ADiUDfevkaSA/viewform, google form}] - Efficiently collect hyperlinks to student work.

- *Broadening Participation* [@link{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17uEl-yS2smjSuOdDLJPzMWWffeXTqBsENjAaZe_qkso/view, slides}] - This compilation of best-practices from the CS-Education literature offers guidance on broadening student participation.
