== Why CODAP?
Write some stuff here.

== Teaching Remotely?
If you're teaching remotely, we've assembled an @link{../../ImplementationNotes.shtml, Implementation Notes} page that makes specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.

== Ordering Student Workbooks?
While we give our workbooks away as a PDF (see below), we understand that printing them yourself can be expensive! You can purchase beautifully-bound copies of the student workbook from Lulu.com. @link{https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/dorai-sitaram-and-ben-lerner-and-joe-politz-and-flannery-denny/bootstrapdata-science-workbook/paperback/product-9j9ede.html, Click here to order}.
