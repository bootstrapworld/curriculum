= Teacher Resources for Reactive

- *Online Community (Discourse)* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Want to ask a question or pose a lesson idea for other Bootstrap teachers? Want to be kept up-to-date about Bootstrap events, workshops, and curricular changes? Our new discussion forum is the place to do it.

- *Broadening Participation* [@link{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17uEl-yS2smjSuOdDLJPzMWWffeXTqBsENjAaZe_qkso/view, Google Slides}] - Making computing relevant, accessible and welcoming to all students isn't a pipe-dream. Like anything else worth doing, it takes some good practice and a desire to do it right and keep improving. We've put together some pointers based on best-practices from the CS-Education literature, for Bootstrap teachers or anyone looking to broaden participation in Computer Science.
