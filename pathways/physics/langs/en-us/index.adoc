The Bootstrap:Physics materials are the result of the @link{https://aapt.org/K12/Computational-Modeling-in-Physics-First.cfm, Computational Modeling in Physics First with Bootstrap} project, a collaboration between the @link{https://aapt.org/,AAPT}, @link{https://modelinginstruction.org/,AMTA}, @link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/, Bootstrap}, and @link{https://stemteachersnyc.org/, STEMteachersNYC}.

The "Physics First"-based course consists of six units:

[#physics-lesson-list]
Unit 0:: Pyret Introduction
Unit 1:: Qualitative Energy Model
Unit 2:: Constant Velocity Model
Unit 3:: Uniform Acceleration Model
Unit 4:: Balanced Forces Model
Unit 5:: Unbalanced Forces Model
WTF:: Why does this work?

== Teaching Remotely?
If you're teaching remotely, we've assembled an @link{../../ImplementationNotes.shtml, Implementation Notes} page that makes specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.
