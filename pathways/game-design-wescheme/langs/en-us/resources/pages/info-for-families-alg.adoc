== My child is learning Computer Science in math class?

@right{@image{../images/algebra-logo.png, 150}} Yes! @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/algebra, Bootstrap:Algebra} is a series of integrated computer science modules that have been specially designed to reinforce and deepen math competency while building fluency with programming. Bootstrap has been road-testing, researching, and improving upon these materials since 2005. +
@vspace{1ex} +
By introducing students to rigorous and engaging computing content in the classes that every student takes - regardless of gender, race, or background - Bootstrap is one of the largest providers of formal Computer Science education to girls and underrepresented students nationwide: nearly 50% of students self-identify as African-American or Latin(x), and nearly 45% are girls and young women.

Through Bootstrap:Algebra your child will have the opportunity to:

- see the math behind video games and other programs they use everyday
- learn to code, opening doors to further study and careers in Computer Science
- answer the question, "When am I ever going to use this?!" about many topics covered in math class
- apply their creativity and math skills to writing real programs that make flags, capture a butterfly, and make a rocket take off!
- learn about a diverse set of pioneers and role models in computing and math

@vspace{1ex}

Bootstrap:Algebra also strengthens student understanding of a variety of math topics. Through Bootstrap:Algebra, students will discover new ways of thinking about the Order of Operations, the Coordinate Plane, Inequalities, Functions, the Pythagorean Theorem, and word problems.

@link{https://bootstrapworld.org/impact/, Evaluations of the curriculum} show that students perform better on standard, pencil-and-paper word problems after using Bootstrap:Algebra in their math classes. Students who apply their math skills to create a video game feel a strong sense of ownership, originality, and pride in their creations. Additionally, females find videogame creation just as satisfying as males, which may reflect the nature of games created in this curriculum and the opportunities it offers for self-expression.

== What supports are in the materials to help my child succeed?

Bootstrap's programming environments have been developed with student learning as their top priority! A lot of research has been dedicated to designing the learning environment to:
 
- catch typical student mistakes and explain them in terms that students understand, so that students can debug their code independently
- develop student understanding of @vocab{functions} and @vocab{variables} in programming in such a way that it transfers to increased understanding of these concepts in Algebra
- integrate scaffolds that support students in solving word problems 
- make visible the structure behind the order of operations, such that students develop deeper understanding than they would by relying on mnemonic devices

== What can my student do to be successful in this course?

Even if you have no experience with Computer Science, there are ways you can support your child. 

- _Encourage your child to prepare for time with hands on keys in the programming environment by working through the paper-and-pencil exercises assigned by their teacher._ The curriculum strategically incorporates pencil-and-paper tasks to support student learning. 
- _Encourage your student to make sure that they are learning how to write code that can be understood by another programmer._ Sometimes students get so excited about creating a video game, that they focus exclusively on making the game work. Good computer programmers write code that not only works, but can be made sense of by others, whether to learn from it, debug it, or expand upon it as goals shift. 

== More About Bootstrap

The Bootstrap team brings decades of research and classroom experience to its work, with deep roots in middle, high school, undergraduate, and graduate classrooms. The team is comprised of computer scientists, education researchers, and K-12 practitioners. The Bootstrap research group is based at Brown University, and the National Science Foundation offers continued support Bootstrap's work. Research involves statewide partnerships and numerous smaller collaborations with schools and districts, which continues to inform and improve curricular materials.

In addition to their work integrating Algebra and Computer Science, Bootstrap is a leading provider of curriculum for @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/data-science, Data Science} (with integration across many subject areas), and also develops materials for Physics and upper elementary and middle school Math.
