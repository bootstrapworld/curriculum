== Teaching Remotely?
If you're teaching remotely, we've assembled an @link{../../ImplementationNotes.shtml, Implementation Notes} page that makes specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.


[.announcement]
**The earlier version of our materials is also available @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2020/courses/algebra/es-mx/index.shtml, en Espa√±ol}.** Let us know if you can @link{mailto:contact@BootstrapWorld.org, lend a hand} translating the new version!

== Ordering Student Workbooks?
While we give our workbooks away as a PDF (see below), we understand that printing them yourself can be expensive! You can purchase beautifully-bound copies of the student workbook from Lulu.com.
