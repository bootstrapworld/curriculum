@right{@image{../images/code-logo.png, 200}} **We were flattered when @link{https://www.code.org, Code.org} chose to build their @link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra, CS in Algebra curriculum} around Bootstrap:Algebra in 2014.** In fact, they hired us to consult on the project, and to conduct the majority of their teacher trainings the following summer! It's been a blast to see our work on the Design Recipe, Circles of Evaluation, and math-focused programming used by Code.org teachers. +

We're sad to hear that Code is no longer making their Algebra materials available. Everyone on our curriculum team is a former teacher, and **we know how hard it can be to lose a curriculum you're students love!** +
@vspace{1ex} +
**Fortunately, CS in Algebra's Bootstrap heritage means that there's a smooth path for teachers looking to pick up where they left off.** We've kept refining and improving our materials over the last decade, making them easier to use and integrating even more math-ed best practices to improve student outcomes. If you're a teacher who likes CS in Algebra, you're going to love Bootstrap! +

== How Do I Get Started?

Our entire curriculum - including lesson plans, homework assignments, assessments, rubrics, slides, and more - @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/algebra-pyret/, are freely available.}

@vspace{2ex}

If you're interest in getting some professional development, look for a @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/workshops, workshop} in your area or online.

We're running a virtual 1-day Algebra PD September 30th for everyone interested in learning more about the curriculum. If you'd like to be notified when registration opens - or simply to stay connected to Bootstrap - @link{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n20zYRxpnL9EdZpa0VzUjsBks46ZyA1v1QgnVogBj0g/edit?usp=sharing_eil_m&ts=6480b716, join our mailing list}.


== What Stays the Same?

- We invented Circles of Evaluation as a way to think about @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/order-of-operations/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret, order of operations} and @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/function-composition/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret,function composition}. CS in Algebra's "@link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/2/levels/1,Evaluation Blocks}" are based on these Circles, so you'll feel right at home.
- We introduce students to Domain and Range using our @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/contracts/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret,Contracts} lesson. @link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/5/levels/1,So does CS in Algebra}.
- We teach students a structural approach to solving word problems using the @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/functions-dr/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret,Design Recipe}. @link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/11/levels/1,CS in Algebra does, too}.
- We apply linear functions in our "@link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/functions-dr/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret#_rocket_height_duration25_minutes,Rocket Height}" activity. @link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/10/levels/1, So does CS in Algebra}.
- We apply inequalities to protect "@link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/inequalities3-sam/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret,Sam the Butterfly}". CS in Algebra uses them to protect "@link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/15/levels/1,Sam the Bat}".
- We have a lesson that shows students @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/numbers-inside-video-games/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret,how math is used in the video games} they play every day. So does @link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/1/levels/1,CS in Algebra}.
- We use piecewise functions to add @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/player-animation/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret, player movement} in student-created videogames. @link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/18/levels/1,So does CS in Algebra}.
- We use the distance formula to handle @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/inequalities-collision/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret,collision in student games}. @link{https://studio.code.org/s/algebra/lessons/20/levels/1,So does CS in Algebra}.

== What's Different?

- The biggest difference is that students will be programming in a text-based language called @link{https://www.Pyret.org}, rather than a block-based one. Pyret was designed specifically for classroom contexts, making it an ideal "first language" for students who have only used blocks before. Pyret includes learner-friendly error messages, that are written in clear, easy to understand language. Pyret syntax is also simple and easy to follow, making it substantially more approachable for students than "professional" languages like Javascript and Python.
- We take paper and pencil seriously, and recognize that sometimes the best place for students to do thinking is OFF the computer. Every Bootstrap activity are scaffolded by a workbook page (available in print and digital form), which can be done without a computer. CS in Algebra has a few "unplugged" activities, but assumes that students are in front of the computer most of the time.
- Students who complete Bootstrap:Algebra can build on what they know, going deeper into Statistics in @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/data-science, Bootstrap:Data Science}, Computer Science in @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/reactive, Bootstrap:Reactive}, and even Algebra 2 (stay tuned!). In contrast, CS in Algebra was intentionally designed as a terminal curriculum - it does not build towards other courses.
- Bootstrap:Algebra is laser-focused on improving math outcomes for students, and is based on best-practices in math education. Our curriculum has been independently evaluated, showing @link{http://www.bootstrapworld.org/impact, gains in algebra} (we also @link{http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sfkf-trans-word-prob-comp-alg-bs/, published our own transfer results}). CS in Algebra has not been evaluated for student outcomes.
- CS in Algebra is primarily focused on building a videogame. While that's an option in Bootstrap:Algebra, some teachers focus on our other projects (like @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/lessons/flags/index.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret, Making Flags}), or even just focusing entirely on the math!
- Bootstrap:Algebra also goes well beyond the math covered in Code.org's curriculum. We have lessons on the vertical line test, connecting multiple representations of functions, computing the surface area of prisms, and @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/algebra-pyret/,much more}.
- We offer a @link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/fall2023/en-us/Alignments.shtml?pathway=algebra-pyret, complete standards-alignment} guide, to help you identify where these lessons fit within your math or CS class.
