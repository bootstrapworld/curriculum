Like Illustrative Mathematics, Bootstrap is field-tested and research-validated, with a focus on deep exploration that supports and engages all kinds of learners.  Our integrated computing modules have been proven to support math transfer and can be mixed and matched to supplement what you’re already doing in your classroom. __Teaching 7th grade math with Bootstrap also addresses many CS Standards, including: 2-AP-1, 2-AP-10, 2-AP-11, 2-AP-13, 2-AP-14, 2-AP-17.__

@link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/algebra-wescheme/lessons/function-composition/index.shtml,*Function Composition*}

- For some students, plotting coordinates by hand is arduous!
- Looking for follow-up materials that will engage students in thinking about scale factors with more immediate feedback? We’ve got you!
- Simple code allows students to experiment with scaling images (including shapes, their name, or any image from their google drive) up or down using scale factors and distorting images using scale-xy.


|@link{https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/MS/teachers/2/2/index.html,*Introducing Proportional Relationships*}
| @span{.right}{@image{../../images/making-flags.png, "", 80}}

@link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/algebra-wescheme/lessons/flags/index.shtml,*Making Flags*}

- Flags are an authentic application for ratios and scaling!
- Flags also offer our students a rare opportunity to connect to and share pride in their identities in math class.
- In this lesson, students write code both to scale and locate shapes on the coordinate grid to recreate an image of their choosing.
- Low-threshold and high-ceiling, students of all kinds of minds love building flags - some will make many! And they take great pride in seeing their flags and code hanging on classroom walls.


|@link{https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/MS/teachers/2/6/index.html,*Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities*}
| @span{.right}{@image{../../images/order-of-operations.png, "", 80}}

@link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/algebra-wescheme/lessons/order-of-operations/index.shtml,*Order of Operations*}

- Instead of a list of rules to memorize, we use the Circles of Evaluation to expose the structure of the math involved in evaluating expressions. Check it out! It’s a powerful tool.
- _Circles of Evaluation can be used without any programming!_

@link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/algebra-wescheme/lessons/inequalities1-simple/index.shtml,*Simple Inequalities*}

- Simple code enables students to test solutions and non-solutions to inequalities, concretizing the concept by providing immediate visual feedback. The computer plots points provided by students in either green or red, depending on if those points make the inequality true or false.
- In the Sam the Butterfly lesson, students use what they know about inequalities to define the boundaries that will keep a video game character on the screen.


|@link{https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/MS/teachers/2/7/index.html,*Angles, Triangles, and Prisms*}
| @span{.right}{@image{../../images/function-comp-star.png, "", 80}}
@span{.right}{@image{../../images/function-comp-star2.png, "", 80}}

@link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/algebra-wescheme/lessons/function-composition/index.shtml,*Making Shapes from Code*}

- Get your students coding with highly motivational image functions! Writing simple code to build a wide range of shapes of different colors and sizes, reinforces vocabulary for describing polygons.
- While this lesson does not focus on area and perimeter, for those looking to extend beyond the scope of the CMP3 unit, the function composition lesson offers an intuitive low-threshold, high-ceiling introduction to transformations.

|@link{https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/MS/teachers/2/8/index.html,*Probability and Sampling*}

| @span{.right}{@image{../../images/randomness-and-samplesize-2.png, "", 140}}

@link{https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/courses/data-science/lessons/random-samples/index.shtml,*Randomness and Sample Size*}

- Simple code allows students to quickly generate samples of various sizes from any dataset.
- In seconds, students can generate pie charts to see how the samples compare to each other and use them to make predictions about the full dataset.
- Students can test their predictions against findings from the full dataset
