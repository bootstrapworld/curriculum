Like IM, Bootstrap is field-tested and research-validated, with a focus on deep exploration that supports and engages all kinds of learners.  Our integrated computing modules have been proven to support math transfer and can be mixed and matched to supplement what you’re already doing in your classroom. __Teaching Algebra 1 with Bootstrap also addresses many CS Standards, including: XXXXXXXX.__

| *IM Unit*
| *Integrated Computing Lessons that can extend the IM Unit*


| *Linear Equations, Inequalities, and Systems*
|

*Linear Relationships* and *Defining Linear Relationships*

- We offer an abundance of interactive materials to get students thinking about whether relationships represented in tables and graphs are linear.
- No programming required

@span{.right}{@image{../../images/sam-the-butterfly.png, "", 80}}
*Simple Inequalities* and *Compound Inequalities*

- Simple code enables students to test solutions and non-solutions to inequalities.
- The computer plots points provided by students on a numberline in either green or red, depending on if those points make the inequality true or false.
- In the Sam the Butterfly lesson, students use what they know about inequalities to define the boundaries that will keep a video game character on the screen.

| *Two-variable Statistics*
| @span{.right}{@image{../../images/making-flags.png, "", 90}}
*Scatter Plots*

- Simple code allows students to quickly generate scatterplots from any dataset, allowing for lively discussion about trends observed.

*Correlations*

- Your students will search out correlations in a dataset, discussing and analyzing the form, direction, and strength of the linear relationships they see in the scatterplots they generate.
- Students will repeat this process in a dataset of their choice, one that sparks their interest. Simple code enables students to use linear regression to quantify patterns in their dataset.
- Our data science curriculum leverages students' curiosity about the world around them to inspire real data analysis and original research. Individual lessons are impactful regardless of whether you opt to facilitate the culminating research project or not.

| *Functions*
| @span{.right}{@image{../../images/solving-word-problems.png, "", 90}}
 *Solving Word Problems*

- Students solve a classic function word problem about the velocity and height of a rocket - and then write simple code to see the rocket blast off. They can even modify the code to change the speed and direction of the rocket!

*Piecewise Functions*

- A fictional restaurant owner, Alice, solicits students’ help in improving some code used at the restaurant. As students analyze the code, they interact with piecewise functions in an engaging new context.
- Videogames rely on piecewise functions for player animation! The video game project offers an exciting opportunity to apply new and otherwise abstract mathematical knowledge.
