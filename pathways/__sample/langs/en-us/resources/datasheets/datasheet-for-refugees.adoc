The dataset has been created to help identify countries that produce a significant percentage of the world’s refugees and help pinpoint “push factors” of refugees. The dataset is meant to expose students to the plight of refugees, educate students on the distribution of refugees’ countries of origin over regions of the world, and be a starting point on which change could be instigated effectively.

== Process Collection



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-how}
// [.question.required]
// How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
// the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
// reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly

// model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
// subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
// data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
[.answer]
--


The data was aggreated manually from five sources: four datasets from Gapminder and one pdf from The Economist. The Gapminder datasets were already on google sheets, so I copied the columns I needed into my dataset and tidied the data. The pdf, however, did not come with a pre-made google sheets; it listed the countries under each democracy category: “full democracy”, “flawed democracy”, “hybrid regime” and “authoritarian." I manually inputted the democracy category of each country into my dataset.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-tools}
// [.question.required]
// What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
// (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
// software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
// procedures validated?
[.answer]
--

The procedure used to collect data was manual human curation. All columns except "Region" were untouched data from the sources mentioned before.

The data in the column "Region" was not sourced from any external dataset. I manually assigned each country in this dataset to a region of the world among the following regions: Africa, Asia, Central America, Europe, Middle East, North America, Oceania, and South America. In other words, I added Central America and the Middle East to the continents of the world (excluding Antarctica). I added these two regions because they were significantly different, in terms of human development and political stability, from the regions in which they were previously included.

@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-subset}
// [.question.required]
// If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
// sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
// specific sampling probabilities)?
[.answer]
--

The sampling strategy was only including the countries that had available data for the following columns of the dataset:
"Percent of global population"
"Percent of global refugees originating from country"
"Personal security index"
"Democracy category"
"Civil liberties index"
"Human development index"

Yes. The raw data came from four sources on Gapminder’s website and one source from The Economist.
1. Dataset on the percentage share of global refugees originating from each country.
2. Dataset on democracy indices of countries. The specific sheet from the dataset: personal integrity & security.
3. Dataset on the civil liberty indices of countries.
4. Dataset on the human development indices of countries.
5. Dataset on the democracy category of countries.

// [.question.required]
// Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please
// provide a description.
[.answer]
--


Yes. This dataset has been used by its creator to make a sample research paper. In this paper, the dataset was used to find the top countries from which refugees originate, as well as similarities and differences between these countries. The paper also analyzed how these top countries (and others) fared in personal security and human development scores.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-repo}
// [.question.required]
// Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-potential}
// [.question.required]
// What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?
[.answer]
--


The dataset could be used to compare the personal security and civil liberty scores of regions of the world (i.e. comparing Europe and North America, or Africa and Asia, etc). The dataset could also be used to identify outliers and possibly identify factors that made them outliers.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-future}
// [.question.required]
// Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
// way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
// impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
// user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
// treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
// of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
// harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
// anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
// harms?
[.answer]
--


Future users need to be aware of the list of countries excluded (listed in the Readme) from the dataset and the few countries that have debatable region categorizations (also listed in the Readme). Before reaching conclusions, future users should check if these omissions and categorizations change their findings.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-dontuse}
// [.question.required]
// Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
// so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--


The dataset should not be used to stereotype refugees or people from specific countries. The dataset should also not be used without acknowledging the presence of gaps in the data (i.e. resulting from excluding some countries).
