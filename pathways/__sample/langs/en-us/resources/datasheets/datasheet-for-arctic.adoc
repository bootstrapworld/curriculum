// For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific
// task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
// Please provide a description.
[.answer]

This dataset is a derivative based on [FILL]. In this datasheet, all
all references to “dataset” (unless indicated otherwise) refer to this
derivative. Answers about the original should be contained in the
datasheet (if any) that accompanies the original.

This dataset was created to provide organized data on climate change from 1979 to 2020. It summarizes data on global temperatures along with levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the sea ice extent in the Arctic.

== Composition



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-what}
// [.question.required]
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
[.answer]
--


The instances of this dataset represent the years 1979 through 2020. 

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-quantity}
// [.question.required]
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
[.answer]
--


The dataset covers 42 years. 

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-representativeness}
// [.question.required]
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
[.answer]
--


The dataset only comprises of the years 1979 through 2020, and does not include data that represents the variables prior to 1979. The data collected on temperature per year represents the global average, while data collected on sea ice extent only represents the Arctic, and is not global. This was done in order to focus on a particular region when comparing sea ice changes over time.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-content}
// [.question.required]
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
// provide a description.
[.answer]

Each instance consists of calculated average temperatures (monthly and annual), sea ice extent data (maximum and minimum recorded as well as an annual average), the month in which maximum and minimum sea ice occurred, global mean sea level variation, and global CO2 amount in parts per million.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-missing}
// [.question.required]

// intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
// redacted text.
[.answer]

This dataset can be used to highlight how factors such as the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere correlate with an increase in global temperature anomaly, which in turn is leading to an increase in sea level and a decrease in Arctic sea ice. These correlations are important for environmental policies, such as reducing or regulating carbon emmissions.
