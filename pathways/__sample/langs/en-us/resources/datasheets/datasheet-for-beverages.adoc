This dataset is a derivative based on [FILL]. In this datasheet, all
all references to “dataset” (unless indicated otherwise) refer to this
derivative. Answers about the original should be contained in the
datasheet (if any) that accompanies the original.

This dataset was created to provide interesting data
on making healthy choices when drinking beverages.

// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.

// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
[.answer]
--


It is a sample of instances from a larger set of all beverages.
The sample is representative of the larger set since it covers
various types of beverages. However, the sample excludes all
alcoholic and powerdered beverages.
