== Motivation



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=dataset-name}
// [.question.required]
// What is the name of this dataset?
[.answer]
--

esports


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-purpose}
// [.question.required]
// For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific
// task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
// Please provide a description.
[.answer]
--


This data set was created for the purpose of exploring the strengths of the
esports scenes of games across a variety of genres.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-creator}
// [.question.required]
// Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and
// on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution,
// organization)?
[.answer]
--


This data set was created by David Young, a student at Brown University, for Bootstrap:Data Science.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-funding}
// [.question.optional]
// Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an
// associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the
// grant name and number.
[.answer]
--



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-other}
// [.question.optional]
// Any other comments?
[.answer]
--

The interpretation of the "strength" of the esports scene of a game is left to the user of the data set. Possible interpretations include total winnings, total number of tournaments, total number of players, average number of tournaments per year, etc.

== Composition



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-what}
// [.question.required]
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
[.answer]
--


The instances that comprise the dataset represent video games, which are the only type of instance in this data set.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-quantity}
// [.question.required]
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
[.answer]
--


There are 509 instances in total.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-representativeness}
// [.question.required]
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
[.answer]
--


The data set does not contain all possible instances. The data set is a sample from the larger set of video games. The sample is not representative of the larger set, as we can assume that esportsearnings.com is biased towards games that have an active esports scene because it is a resource crowdsourced from individuals interested in esports. Thus, games that have had no tournaments are less likely to be included in the data set.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-content}
// [.question.required]
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
// provide a description.
[.answer]
--



For each instance, we include the release date of the game as a Number, the predominant genre of the game as a String, the total earnings of all tournament winners as a Number, the earnings that were won through online-only tournaments as a Number, the total number of tournament winners as a Number, and the total number of tournaments as a Number. All data, save the release date and genre, were obtained by summing the statistics of each tournament that took place for a given game.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-label}
// [.question.optional]
// Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
// so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-missing}
// [.question.required]
// Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
// please provide a description, explaining why this information is
// missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
// intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
// redacted text.
[.answer]
--

No information is missing from individual instances.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-relationship}
// [.question.required]
// Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
// (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
// describe how these relationships are made explicit.
[.answer]
--


No relationships between individual instances are explicitly stated.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-splits}
// [.question.optional]
// Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
// development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
// description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
// them.
[.answer]
--



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-errors}
// [.question.required]
// Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
// dataset? If so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--


Errors are possible, as the information is crowdsourced. However, for the same reason, blatant errors are improbable, especially for more popular titles.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-selfcontained}
// [.question.common]
// Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
// rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
// datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
// there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
// time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
// dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
// at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
// restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
// external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
// provide descriptions of all external resources and any
// restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
// access points, as appropriate.

@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-how}
// [.question.required]
// How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
// the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
// reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
// inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
// model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
// subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
// data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.

--


The data associated with each instance was freely available online.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-tools}
// [.question.required]
// What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
// (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
// software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
// procedures validated?
[.answer]
--

The data was manually submitted by users on esportsearnings.com. Submitted data is subject to review by other users, and all submitted data must be accompanied by a reliable citation.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-subset}
// [.question.required]
// If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
// sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
// specific sampling probabilities)?
[.answer]
--


There was no predefined sampling strategy, as the composition of the sample depended solely on the submissions of users on esportsearnings.com.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-who}
// [.question.common]
// Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g.,
// students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they
// compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?
[.answer]
--

@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-who-common-answer}

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-time}
