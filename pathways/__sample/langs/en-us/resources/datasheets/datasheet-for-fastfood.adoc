== Motivation



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=dataset-name}
// [.question.required]
// What is the name of this dataset?
[.answer]
--

fastfood


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-purpose}
// [.question.required]
// For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific
// task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
// Please provide a description.
[.answer]
--


The dataset was created to provide interesting data
for middle school and high school students to learn
data science and statistics. In addition, through this
process of learning, students can gain some insights
on healthy choices of fastfood.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-creator}
// [.question.required]
// Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and
// on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution,
// organization)?
[.answer]
--


Tianren Dong created the dataset with guidance
from Flannery Denny on behalf of 
the @Bootstrap Data Science curriculum.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-funding}
// [.question.optional]
// Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an
// associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the
// grant name and number.
[.answer]

== Composition



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-what}
// [.question.required]
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
[.answer]
--


The instances that comprise the dataset represent various fastfood
in America. These food items are the only type of instance.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-quantity}
// [.question.required]
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
[.answer]
--


There is a total of 461 instances.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-representativeness}
// [.question.required]
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
[.answer]
--


It is a sample of instances from a larger set of all fast food.
The sample is not representative of the larger set since it doesn't
include all types of food produced for speed of service. 
For example, the sample mostly covers fast food commonly found in America,
excluding various other fast food cuisines.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-content}
// [.question.required]
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
// provide a description.
[.answer]
--


Each instance consists of its type, vendor, and
various nutritional information. Nutritional information
includes calories in kcal, fat in grams, protein in grams, 
carbohydrate in grams, cholestorol in milligrams, saturated-fats in grams, 
sodium in milligrams, serving weight in grams, and 200 calorie weight in grams.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-label}
// [.question.optional]
// Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
// so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-missing}
// [.question.required]
// Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
// please provide a description, explaining why this information is
// missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
// intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
// redacted text.
[.answer]
--

There is no information missing from individual instances.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-relationship}
// [.question.required]
// Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
// (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
// describe how these relationships are made explicit.
[.answer]
--


There are no explicit relationships between individual instances.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-splits}
// [.question.optional]
// Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
// development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
// description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
// them.
[.answer]
--



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-errors}
// [.question.required]
// Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
// dataset? If so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--

There are redundancies within same types of fast food instances.
For example, variations are often just one additional topping
or a change in type of bun used.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-selfcontained}
// [.question.common]
// Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
// rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
// datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
// there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
// time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
// dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
// at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
// restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
// external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
// provide descriptions of all external resources and any
// restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
// access points, as appropriate.
