// organization)?
[.answer]
--

{empty}E. C. Holtz and J. Sobel created this dataset on behalf of @Bootstrap.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-funding}
// [.question.optional]
// Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an
// associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the
// grant name and number.
[.answer]
--

This dataset was created by volunteers.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-other}
// [.question.optional]
// Any other comments?
[.answer]
--

No compensation was provided for those who submitted data to the dataset of which this dataset is a sample; all data was compiled by organ enthusiasts who simply want an organ database.

--
== Composition



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-what}
// [.question.required]
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
[.answer]
--


The instances of this dataset are individual pipe organs.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-quantity}
// [.question.required]
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
[.answer]
--


There are 500 instances of pipe organs. 

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-representativeness}
// [.question.required]
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
[.answer]
--


This dataset contains a small fraction of the original 66,018 instances of pipe organs from the Organ Historical Society's Pipe Organ Database. Pipe organs without stoplists were excluded from the sample taken, as not all data in the columns could be collected without a stoplist. This reduced the number of organs that could be sampled to 19,042. 

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-content}
// [.question.required]
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
// provide a description.
[.answer]
--



Each instance consists of text representing the state wherein it resides (or Non-US), text representing the type of institution/location wherein it resides, text representing the original builder of the organ, a number representing the number of ranks (sets of pipes spanning the entire range of a manual/the pedalboard), a number representing the number of stops (usually one rank, but sometimes groups of ranks, which can be selected by the organist to be mixed to create a particular sound), number of manuals (keyboards), a number representing the lowest pitch (written as the length of what the lowest pipe would be if it were an open tube), a number representing the year the organ was originally completed, and a boolean representing whether the organ has been modified or restored since its completion.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-label}
// [.question.optional]
// Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
// so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--

The label associated with each organ is the Pipe Organ Database's ID number for that particular organ.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-missing}
// [.question.required]
// Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
// please provide a description, explaining why this information is
// missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
// intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
// redacted text.
[.answer]
--


No information is missing from any instances.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-relationship}
// [.question.required]
// Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
// (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
// describe how these relationships are made explicit.
[.answer]
--


No instances are related to any others in this dataset.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-splits}
// [.question.optional]
// Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
// development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
// description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
// them.
[.answer]
--


When splitting data, the user should be mindful of the fact that theater organs vary greatly from other organs, and that there are more subtle variations among organs of different builders.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-errors}
// [.question.required]
// Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
// dataset? If so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--


Sometimes, the listed number of stops disagrees with the number listed on the stoplist. In these cases, the one listed directly on the page is the one entered into the dataset.

This dataset in its entirety is not intended for an analysis of the prolificness of any organbuilder. In order to use this dataset for that purpose, remove the first four and last four organs fromt his dataset, as they were selected as organs of note and not sampled with Simple Random Sampling. 

Also, the parent dataset relies on self-reporting of existing organs. This means that organs in certain regions may be underrepresented.



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-selfcontained}
// [.question.common]
// Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
// rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
// datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
// there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
// time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
// dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
// at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
// restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
// external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
// provide descriptions of all external resources and any
// restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
// access points, as appropriate.

== Process Collection



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-how}
// [.question.required]
// How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
// the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
// reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
// inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
// model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
// subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
// data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
[.answer]
--


The data in this dataset was recorded in the Organ Historical Society's Pipe Organ Database. Stop counts could be verified by stoplists, but no organs were directly observed in the coellction of this data.

--
