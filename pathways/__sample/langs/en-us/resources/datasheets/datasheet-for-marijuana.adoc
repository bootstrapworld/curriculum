marijuana


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-purpose}
// [.question.required]
// For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific
// task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
// Please provide a description.
[.answer]
--

This dataset was created for the Bootstrap:Data Science middle school curriculum. It was created as a volunteer project
and did not receive any form of funding.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-creator}
// [.question.required]
// Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and
// on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution,
// organization)?
[.answer]
--



The dataset was created primarily by Brown University undergraduate Gareth Mansfield with the assistance of Dr. Kathi Fisler,
Dr. Shriram Krishnamurthi, and Dr. Emmanuel Schanzer on behalf of the Bootstrap curriculum created by the Brown University 
Computer Science Department.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=mot-funding}
// [.question.optional]
// Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an
// associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the
// grant name and number.
[.answer]
--


The dataset received no funding.

== Composition



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-what}
// [.question.required]
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
[.answer]
--


Each instance represents a US state, with population and arrest data for the year 2018.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-quantity}
// [.question.required]
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
[.answer]
--

There are 49 state listed (data was not available for Florida).


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-representativeness}
// [.question.required]
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
[.answer]
--


The dataset includes nearly every possible instance with the exception of Florida, for which data
was not available. It also does not include the District of Columbia or any other US territories.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-content}
// [.question.required]
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
// provide a description.
[.answer]
--


Each instance consists only of numbers and strings. The legalization year, decriminalization year,
and medical marijuana legalization year are all treated as strings, as some have multiple values
(indicated by a "/") and many have no value (indicated by the string "No").

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-label}
// [.question.optional]
// Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
// so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--


N/A

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-missing}
// [.question.required]
// Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
// please provide a description, explaining why this information is
// missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
// intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
// redacted text.
[.answer]
--


No information is missing from individual instances.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-relationship}
// [.question.required]
// Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
// (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
// describe how these relationships are made explicit.
[.answer]
--


There are no direct relationships between different instances that could be made explicit.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-splits}
// [.question.optional]
// Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
// development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
// description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
// them.
[.answer]
--


There are no recommended data splits.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-errors}
// [.question.required]
// Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
// dataset? If so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, from which this data originates, uses data from 18,000 agencies
across the country. Participation in this program is voluntary, and some agencies refuse to participate. Data from missing
agencies was imputated by a method outlined in the ACLU report, but this is not 100% accurate. However, the majority of
agencies did participate, so this error is expected to be very small. A deeper analysis of the error sources is included 
within the ACLU report.



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-selfcontained}
// [.question.common]
// Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
// rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
// datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
// there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
// time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
// dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
// at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
// restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
// external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
// provide descriptions of all external resources and any
// restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
// access points, as appropriate.

[.answer]
--

The dataset relates to people.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-subpopulation}
// [.question.optional]
// Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age,
// gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are
// identified and provide a description of their respective
// distributions within the dataset.
[.answer]
--


The data breaks the population of each US state (with the exception of Florida) down by race, specifically
identifying the white and black subpopulations.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-doxx}
// [.question.common]
// Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more
// natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=comp-sensitivity}
// [.question.optional]
// Does the dataset contain data that might be considered
// sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals racial or ethnic
// origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political
// opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health
// data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government
// identification, such as social security numbers; criminal
// history)? If so, please provide a description.

== Process Collection



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-how}
// [.question.required]
// How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
// the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
// reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
// inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
// model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
// subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
// data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
[.answer]
--


The data was acquired from an ACLU research report entitled "A Tale of Two Countries - Racially Targeted arrests
in the Era of Marijuana Reform", which obtained its data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-tools}
// [.question.required]
// What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
// (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
// software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
// procedures validated?
[.answer]
--


The data was collected directly from a pdf published by the ACLU. A Python script was used to convert it into a .csv file
which could be read by Google sheets.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-subset}
// [.question.required]
// If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
// sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
// specific sampling probabilities)?
[.answer]
--


The dataset is not a sample of a larger set.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-who}
// [.question.common]
// Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g.,
// students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they
// compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?
[.answer]
--

@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-who-common-answer}

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-time}
// [.question.required]
// Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe
// match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the
// instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not,
// please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with
// the instances was created.
[.answer]
--

The data was collected into this dataset from the ACLU report in January 2021. The ACLU compiled the report in 2020.
The drug arrest and population data reflects values from 2018, and the marijuana legalization data reflects values that were true
as of March 2020.


--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-ethics}
// [.question.common]
// Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an

[.answer]
--


The data was obtained through an ACLU report, which obtained it from the FBI’s uniform crime reporting program.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-notification}
// [.question.optional]
// Were the individuals in question notified about the data
// collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or
// other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or
// other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language
// of the notification itself.
[.answer]
--


The dataset does not contain any information pertaining to specific individuals, so no individuals were notified.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=coll-consent}
// [.question.optional]
// Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and
// use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with

== Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=preproc-preproc}
// [.question.required]
// Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g.,
// discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech
// tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances,
// processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a
// description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions
// in this section.
[.answer]
--


Very little preprocessing was performed; the only preprocessing that occurred involved combining two tables from the ACLU report 
together, and replacing empty cells with the string "No".

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=preproc-save}
// [.question.optional]
// Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the
// preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated

The dataset has not been used for any tasks as of January 14, 2021.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-repo}
// [.question.required]
// Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or
// systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or
// other access point.
[.answer]
--



--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-potential}
// [.question.required]
// What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?
[.answer]
--


The dataset could be used for essentially study of the relationship between the racial makeup of a population and
marijuana-related arrests, as well as comparing the impact of marijuana legalization and decriminalization on crime rates.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-future}
// [.question.required]
// Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
// way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
// impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
// user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
// treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
// of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
// harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
// anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
// harms?
[.answer]
--


The legalization dates listed are only true as of March 2020. Any future users should research recent marijuana legalization events 
and amend the dataset accordingly before performing an analysis.

Additionally, users should be aware that data for the state of Florida was not included, and remember to not generalize findings 
from this dataset to all 50 US states, as only 49 are represented.

--
@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=use-dontuse}
// [.question.required]
// Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
// so, please provide a description.
[.answer]
--


The dataset only reflects values for 49 US states, and holds data for two races. It should not be treated as a general analysis
of worldwide marijuana use, as the laws, regulations, and culture surrounding marijuana use vary greatly by country. It should also
not be generalized to other races such as Latinxs.

Additionally, this data should not be used to imply any causality between the legalization of marijuana and any changes in arrest
rates. That sort of analysis would, at minimum, require the dataset to include data for each state both prior to and after the 
legalization of marijuana.

--
== Distribution



@include{datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc, tag=dist-3rdparty}
// [.question.common]
