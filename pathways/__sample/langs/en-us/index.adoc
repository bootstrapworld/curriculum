== Pathway pages are entirely optional!

By default, the build script will create this page using all of the lessons defined in lesson-order.txt. It will also add boilerplate text from shared/langs/XYZ/defines.rkt.

**99% of the time, you will not need a pathway page like this one**

As of fall2022, the only time it's used is for Physics, History and Hour of Code -- as none of those pathways have traditional lesssons.
