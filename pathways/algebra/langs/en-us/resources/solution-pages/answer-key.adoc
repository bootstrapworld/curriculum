= Design Recipe Exercise Answer Key

== target-leap

1. The first example doesn't work. It would work better as
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 100) (* 100 2))` or
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 100) (* 2 100))`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
`target-leap(100) is 100 * 2` or
`target-leap(100) is 2 * 100`
}

2. The second example is incorrect according to the problem
   statement. It could be
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 40) (* 40 2))`  or
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 40) (* 2 40))`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
`target-leap(40) is 40 * 2` or
`target-leap(40) is 2 * 40`
}

3. In the definition, the name of the function should be
`target-leap`.

4. The variable name in the definition should be consistent
(either `x` or `x-coor`).

5. The body of the function definition should be
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
`(* x-coor 2)`.
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
`x-coor * 2`.
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
== offscreen?
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
== is-offscreen
}

1. The Purpose Statement should include “return true if the coordinate is less
than -50 or greater than 690”.

2. Both examples should show the work, not just the answer:
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
a. `(EXAMPLE (offscreen? 60) (or (< 60 -50) (> 60 690)))`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
a. `is-offscreen(60) is (60 < -50) or (60 > 690)`
}
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
b. `(EXAMPLE (offscreen? 800) (or (< 8000 -50) (> 800 690)))`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
b. `is-offscreen(800) is (800 < -50) or (800 > 690)`
}

3. In the definition, the function name should be
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ `offscreen?` instead of `off-screen`. }
@ifproglang{pyret}{ `is-offscreen` instead of `is-off-screen`. }

4. The function definition should use the function `or` instead
   of `and`.

== calc-pencils

1. Both examples should multiply by 5.

2. The variable should be more descriptive: s, or students, to represent the
number of students.

3. In the definition, the function name should be `calc-pencils`.

== circle-area

1. `pi` is not a built-in value, so it should be replaced with an
approximation such as `3.14` or
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ `(/ 22 7)`. }
@ifproglang{pyret}{ `(22 / 7)`. }

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
2. If using
`(/ 22 7)`
for `pi`, the function body could be
+
`(* (sqr (/ diameter 2)) (/ 22 7))`
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
2. If using
`(22 / 7)`
for `pi`, the function body could be
+
`num-sqr(diameter / 2) * (22 / 7))`
}

== check-total

1. The examples should use the function name `check-total` instead
of `total`.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{

2. Both examples have too many parentheses for the function call.

3. The `*` function must come before its inputs in the examples:
+
`(+ (* 0.20 56.67) 56.67))`

4. The function body should have the `*` and `+` functions
reversed:
+
`(+ (* 0.20 food-total) food-total)`
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{

2. Both examples have an extra input that isn't attached to an
   operator or function:
+
`((0.2 * 20) + 20)`

3. The `*` operator must be used instead of `x` to show multiplication in the examples:
+
`((0.20 * 56.67) + 56.67)`

4. The function body should have the `*` and `+` operators
reversed:
+
`(0.20 * food-total) + food-total`
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
 == enough-carpet?
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
== have-enough-carpet
}


1. The range of the function should be a Boolean.

2. The example inputs should not be in an extra set of
   parentheses.

3. Both the examples and the function definition should use `<=`
instead of `<`.

@ifproglang{pyret}{
4. The example inputs should be separated by a comma.
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
== enough-cash?
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
== have-enough-cash
}

1. The domain of the function should be a Number (representing
the price), not a String.

2. The two examples should give numbers as an input and test if
they are less than 1.50. For instance,
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
`(EXAMPLE (enough-cash? 2.50) (<= 2.50 1.50))`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
`have-enough-cash(2.50) is 2.50 <= 1.50`
}

3. The variable name in the function body can be `item`, but a
more accurate name would be `price` or `cost`.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
== equal-length?
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
== equal-length
}

1. The function body should be:
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
`(= (string-length string1) (string-length string2))`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
`string-length(string1) == string-length(string2)`

2. The inputs in the examples should be in quotes -- `"yes"`,
   `"no"`.
}

== flower-name

1. The purpose statement should read “Takes in the color and
   returns the name of that flower”.

2. The second example should be
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
`(EXAMPLE (flower-name "purple") "tulip")`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
`flower-name("purple") is "tulip"`

3. In the examples, all the colors and flower names should be Strings, written inside quotation marks.
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
== long-name?
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
== is-long-name
}

1. Both examples should use the function `string-length`, not
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ `string=?`. }
@ifproglang{pyret}{ `string-equal`. }

2. The examples should check if the name is longer than 20
   characters, not 10.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
3. The function name in the definition should be `long-name?`.
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
3. The function name in the definition should be `is-long-name`.
}


4. The body of the function should be
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
`(< (string-length name) 20)`
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
`string-length(name) < 20`
}

== scale-image

1. The purpose statement doesn't specify which strings matter, or
how much to scale by.
+
The examples do not use the `scale` function at all, and instead
change the parameters of the image. The first example should be:
+
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
----
(EXAMPLE (scale-image (circle 5 "solid" "red") "bigger")
         (scale 2 (circle 5 "solid" "red"))
----
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
----
scale-image(circle(5, "solid", "red"), "bigger") is
         scale(2, circle(5, "solid", "red"))
----
}

2. The function name in the second example is incorrect.

== state-tax

1. The domain for the function should be
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ `String Number` }
@ifproglang{pyret}{ `String, Number` }
to account for both
the state and the price of the item.

2. The function name in both examples should be `state-tax`.

3. The example inputs (`"Delaware"` and `"Georgia"`) should be
   Strings.

4. Examples should include a numerical price instead of the variable name
`price`.

5. The examples should use `*` not `+`.

6. The function variable name should not contain spaces and must
   be consistent throughout the function definition. It should
   instead be `price`.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
== late-to-class?
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
== late-to-class
}

1. Both examples should include 4 numbers as inputs.

2. In the first example, `<` should be used in place of `>`.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
3. Both examples and the function definition should calculate
   distance based on the 4 inputs, such as:
+
`((late-to-class? 40 55 80 100) (< 25 (distance 40 55 80 100)))`
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
3. Both examples and the function definition should calculate
   distance based on the 4 inputs, such as:
+
`late-to-class(40, 55, 80, 100) is 25 < distance(40, 55, 80, 100)`
}

4. The two examples should be different from each other.  Since
   the function returns a Boolean, good practice would be to make
   one example that is true and another that is false.
