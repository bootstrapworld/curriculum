= Buggy Design Recipes

Mastering the Design Recipe is a critical component of nearly all Bootstrap pathways. The structure of the Recipe helps students solve problems, make their thinking explicit along the way, and gives educators a chance to point students towards their mistakes simply by asking questions.

We've assembled a list of the most-common Design Recipe mistakes that Bootstrap students make, and created these "Buggy Recipes" to embody each one.

- *Educators* can use these to sharpen their pedagogical skills, getting practice identifying mistakes and then using the structure of the recipe to guide students to the issue without giving it away.
- *Students* can use them as "find the mistake" practice activities, where they look for the bug, fix it, and discuss what misconception might have led to that mistake.
