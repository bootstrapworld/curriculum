= Teacher Resources for Game Design

== Let's Get Started
- *Online Community* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org, Discourse}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share ideas!
- *Remote Instruction* [@dist-link{ImplementationNotes.shtml, link}] - specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.
- *Poster Set for Classroom Walls* [@lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices/pages/computing-pioneers.adoc, link}] - This poster set features Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics. For greater impact, engage your students with these materials using our @lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices} lesson. (You can also @link{https://www.printme1.com/1100aa4996, purchase a printed set yourself!})

=== Standalone Hour of Code Activities from Bootstrap

- *Hour of Data* [@lesson-link{hoc-data/, link}] - A self-guided Desmos activity for exploring a real dataset to make sense of a real-world problem.

- *Snowman Puzzle* [@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1Lgax_uAdFxUJzyGKPbx2BESj9BNkTK3i&v=1904b2c, link}] - This Pyret Starterfile has all the pieces your students will need to make a snowman by changing the coordinates in the code.

== Projects in Bootstrap:Game Design

@link{../../../lessons/project-video-game, "Building an original video game"} is the (optional) capstone project for Bootstrap Algebra. This project involves all of the various algebra and programming concepts covered in the lessons, providing students with a creative way to demonstrate their mastery of the material.

== Other Curricular Materials

- *Contracts* [@link{solution-pages/Contracts.pdf, PDF}] - for teachers who want only the contracts reference from the back of the student workbook, without using the entire book.
- *Glossary* [@link{../../../Glossary.shtml?pathway=videogame, link}] - All of the vocabulary words (and their definitions) used in this pathway.
- *Bilingual Glossary of Bootstrap Terms (English-Spanish)* [@link{../../../lib/bilingual-glossary.html, link}] - For teachers with ELL/ESL students, we provide a bilingual glossary for all of the terms used across our curriculum library.
- *Blank Design Recipe Worksheet* [@dist-link{pages/2-blank-pyret-recipes.adoc, html}] - Use alongside story problems for a function development template.
- *Collection of Bootstrap:Algebra Desmos Activities* [@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5fbecc2b40d7aa0d844956f0, link}]
