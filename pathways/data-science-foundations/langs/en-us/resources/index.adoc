= Teacher Resources for Data Science

== Let's Get Started
- **Implementation Options** [@link{pages/implementation-options.html, link}] Bootstrap:Data Science was designed to be flexible, allowing for implementations in Middle and High School ranging from 1-week exposures to full-year courses! Find recommendations for the course structure that's right for you.
- **Online Community (Discourse)** [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share out ideas!

=== Printables for Classroom Walls

- **Computing Pioneers Posters** [@lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices/pages/computing-pioneers.adoc, link}] - For greater impact, use our @lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices} lesson to engage your students with these posters!

- **Data Fallacies to Avoid** [@lesson-link{threats-to-validity/pages/Geckoboard-Data-Fallacies-Poster.pdf, link}] from @link{https://geckoboard.com/best-practice/statistical-fallacies/, geckoboard.com}

=== Standalone Hour of Code Activities from Bootstrap

- **Hour of Data** [@lesson-link{hoc-data/, link}] - A self-guided Desmos activity for exploring a real dataset, and using it to make sense of a real-world problem.
- **Snowman Puzzle** [@lesson-link{hoc-winter-parley, link}] - This Pyret Starterfile has all the pieces your students will need to make a snowman by changing the coordinates in the code.

== Projects

Projects allow exploration of data collected by students themselves or chosen from our library. The Bootstrap:Data Science curriculum includes four mini projects, each designed to span 2-5 class periods. We also offer two multi-lesson, capstone projects.

**Mini Projects**

- @lesson-link{project-beautiful-data, "Beautiful Data"} - Students use creativity and code to meaningfully visualize data.
- @lesson-link{project-design-a-survey, "Design a Survey"} - Students practice collecting clean data.
- @lesson-link{project-infographic, "Make an Infographic"} - Students create their own infographics, thinking critically and creatively about ratio relationships.
- @lesson-link{project-threats, "When Data Science Goes Bad"} - Students pretend to be "bad data scientists", gaining awareness of how data can be misconstrued.

**Multi-Lesson, Capstone Projects**

- @lesson-link{project-data-exploration, "Dataset Exploration"} - Students explore a dataset of their choice, documenting their journey by creating a @starter-file{exploration-project, "slide deck"} of charts, statistics, and possbible research questions.

- @lesson-link{project-research-paper} - Using the research question they developed during the @lesson-link{project-data-exploration, "Dataset Exploration"}, students create a formal @starter-file{research-paper, "research paper"}, a @starter-file{research-project, "slide deck"}, or both.

== Dataset Library

Students can import their own data into a @starter-file{blank-ds, Blank Starter File} following instruction in @starter-file{blank-ds-tutorial, this tutorial video} or choose from one of the many provided datasets below:

__We have compiled some @lesson-link{choosing-your-dataset/about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.adoc, Notes on our provided datasets}, to help you decide which might be most useful in your classroom.__

== Other Curricular Materials

- **Contracts** [@link{solution-pages/Contracts.pdf, link}] - A PDF of the contracts pages from the back of the student workbook.
- **Glossary** [@dist-link{Glossary.shtml?pathway=data-science, link}] - All of the vocabulary words (and their definitions) used in this pathway.
- **Bilingual Glossary of Bootstrap Terms (English-Spanish)** [@dist-link{lib/bilingual-glossary.html, PDF}] - For teachers with ELL/ESL students, we provide a bilingual glossary for all of the terms used across our curriculum library.
- **Blank Design Recipe Worksheet** - [@dist-link{pages/2-blank-pyret-recipes.adoc, html}] - When students need scaffolding for defining a function.
- **Blank Data Cycle Worksheet** - [@dist-link{pages/2-blank-data-cycles.adoc, html}] - When students need scaffolding for answering a question with data.
- **Collection of Bootstrap:Data Science Desmos Activities** [@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5fc9250afcaa3f30f4946746, link}] - All of our Desmos Data Science lessons, in one place.
- **Sentence Starters** [@dist-link{pages/sentence-starters.adoc, html}] - Use these sentence starters to help students describe patterns, make predictions, find comparisons, share discoveries, formulate hypotheses, and ask questions.
