= Bootstrap:Data Science Foundations

@pathway-logo

This course is appropriate for:

- Teachers who are implementing *purely introductory* Data Science classes, or classes shorter than one year
- Teachers of *younger students*, or those not ready for nonlinear functions
- Teachers who want to *integrate Data Science into _existing_ classes*, like math, science, social studies, cs, or business classes

If you are looking for something more heavyweight for older students - or for those looking to use Data Science as a 3rd-year math class, our full @dist-link{courses/data-science/, Data Science course} may be a better fit.
