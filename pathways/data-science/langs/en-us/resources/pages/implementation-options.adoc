We designed our lessons in Bootstrap:Data Science to be incredibly flexible, with options for teachers in multiple subjects from grade 6-12. When considering an implementation model, there are three criteria to consider:

[.lesson-point]
_Before_ desiging your Data Science class, make sure to write down the answers to these three questions!

. **How much time do you have?** This is going to determine which of the implementation models (shown below) is the right fit for you.

. **What Domain Knowledge do you care about?** Are you in a science class, and you need your students to learn about the Water Cycle? Or maybe it's a social studies class, and you're looking at the long-term impact of red-lining. Think hard about this one! The answer to this question dictates the dataset(s) you'll use or collect, which has significant impacts on engagement, relevance, and inclusion.

. **Which Math and Statistics learning goals do you have?** If you're a middle-school math teacher, maybe your goal is getting kids comfortable with displays like pie and bar charts, histograms, etc. Maybe you're an AP Stats teacher who needs to address Simpson's Paradox. The answer to this question will determine which lessons and projects from our library are relvant to you.

. **How much time do you have to spend on *programming*?** Our programming content can be divided into two "chapters". Chapter 1 requires 3-4 class periods, and teaches enough material to do the __entire course__ with one notable exception: tables cannot be filtered, sorted, or transformed. If you're looking to integrate Data Science into an existing math, science, history, or CS class, this is likely all you need! If you're in a semester or yearlong Statistics or Data Science class, however, you 'll want to add Chapter 2 (4-8 class periods).


== A Complete Data Science Class @duration{1 semester to Full Year}

Designed for Data Science teachers building an entire course! There are tons of projects, including @lesson-link{bar-and-pie-charts/pages/infographic.adoc}, @lesson-link{random-samples/pages/food-habits-project.adoc}, @lesson-link{box-plots/pages/stress-project.adoc}, and @lesson-link{random-samples/pages/time-use-project.adoc}, not to mention the @lesson-link{project-research-paper, Capstone Research Paper}!

Our lessons can be broken up in distinct units, each with a clear theme.

**Note: Many teachers pace themselves in order to have their students analyze _additional datasets_ after completing all five units. Analyzing multiple datasets allows students to refine their skills and broaden and/or deepen domain knowledge. Most teacher start with one of the provided datasets (or a cleaned one they found themselves, and only have students collect their own data after working through their first analysis.**

== More Analysis, Lots of Statistics Options @duration{4 weeks, up to 1 semester}

A module with programming aimed specifically at transforming tables and data visualation, designed for:

- Statistics teachers
- Modeling-Based Science teachers
- Computer Science teachers looking to teach more programming
- Data Science teachers

This format includes multiple project-based options, including @lesson-link{bar-and-pie-charts/pages/infographic.adoc}, @lesson-link{random-samples/pages/food-habits-project.adoc}, @lesson-link{box-plots/pages/stress-project.adoc}, and @lesson-link{random-samples/pages/time-use-project.adoc}.

== Charts, Plots, and Social Impact @duration{1 to 4 weeks}

A module with minimial programming, designed for:

- Science teachers who want students to gather data and generate charts for lab reports
- Math teachers who want students to experiment with charts and plots
- History or Social Studies teachers who want students explore census data, voting data, economic data, etc.
- Computer Science teachers who want a small, gentle exposure to Data Science for their students

In addition to whatever project you want your students to do with the data from your class, this format includes optional projects, such as @lesson-link{bar-and-pie-charts/pages/infographic.adoc} and @lesson-link{box-plots/pages/stress-project.adoc}.
