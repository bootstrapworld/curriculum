== Composition

Dataset creators should read through the questions in this
section prior to any data collection and then provide answers
once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended
to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific
tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.


[.answer]

--
[.question.required]
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
(e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
description.


[.answer]
--
The instances are detailed occupations offered in the US in 2019. 


--
[.question.required]
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
appropriate)?


[.answer]
--
The dataset consists of 140 occupations.


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).


[.answer]
--
The dataset does not contain all possible instances. It is a sample of all 
U.S. occupations in 2019. It is not a representative of the larger set, because 
the sample is not chosen on a random basis. Instances with missing/unavailable
information were removed.


--
[.question.required]
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--
Each instance(occupation) consists of the category to which the occupation belongs to, 
the total number of people employed, the percentage of non-white employees, 
the percentage of female employees, typical entry-level educational requirement, 
annual median wage, weekly median wage, and female weekly median wage.


--
[.question.optional]
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
so, please provide a description.

--
[.question.required]
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
please provide a description, explaining why this information is
missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
redacted text.


[.answer]
--
Everything is included. Rows with missng information were removed.


--
[.question.required]
Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
(e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
describe how these relationships are made explicit.


[.answer]
--
It is written explicitly when instances(occupations) belong to 
the same occupation type. There are no other relationship between instances.


--
[.question.optional]
Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
them.

--
[.question.required]
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.


[.answer]
--
U.S. BLS conducts an annual mail survey of establishments, which provides 
data on employment and wages for occupations and industries throughout the Nation.

[.question.required]
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
harms?


[.answer]
--
Some occupations have been removed due to incomplete information. 
Users would like to avoid drawing conclusions about the entire
U.S. working environment based on the dataset. 


--
[.question.required]
