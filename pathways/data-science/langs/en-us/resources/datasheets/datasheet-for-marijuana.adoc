[.datasheet]
== Composition

Dataset creators should read through the questions in this
section prior to any data collection and then provide answers
once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended
to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific
tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
(e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
description.


[.answer]
--

Each instance represents a US state, with population and arrest data for the year 2018.

--
[.question.required]
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
appropriate)?


[.answer]
--

There are 49 state listed (data was not available for Florida).

--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).


[.answer]
--
 //

The dataset includes nearly every possible instance with the exception of Florida, for which data
was not available. It also does not include the District of Columbia or any other US territories.

--
[.question.required]
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--

Each instance consists only of numbers and strings. The legalization year, decriminalization year,
and medical marijuana legalization year are all treated as strings, as some have multiple values
(indicated by a "/") and many have no value (indicated by the string "No").

--
[.question.optional]
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--

N/A


--
[.question.required]
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
please provide a description, explaining why this information is
missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
redacted text.


[.answer]
--

No information is missing from individual instances.

--
[.question.required]
Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
(e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
describe how these relationships are made explicit.


[.answer]
--

There are no direct relationships between different instances that could be made explicit.

--
[.question.optional]
Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
them.


[.answer]
--

There are no recommended data splits.

--
[.question.required]
Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
dataset? If so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, from which this data originates, uses data from 18,000 agencies
across the country. Participation in this program is voluntary, and some agencies refuse to participate. Data from missing
agencies was imputated by a method outlined in the ACLU report, but this is not 100% accurate. However, the majority of
agencies did participate, so this error is expected to be very small. A deeper analysis of the error sources is included 
within the ACLU report.

--
[.question.common]
Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
provide descriptions of all external resources and any
restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
access points, as appropriate.


[.answer]
--

--
The dataset is self-contained.

There is an archival version of the complete dataset from which this
one was created.

The dataset is released under a CC BY-NC-SA license. Any other uses
require express permission from the Bootstrap team.
--


--
[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered
confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or
by doctorpatient confidentiality, data that includes the content
of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide
a description.


[.answer]
--

The dataset does not contain any confidential information.


--
[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might
be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause
anxiety? If so, please describe why.


[.answer]
--

The data pertains to marijuana-related arrests, marijuana legalization, and associations between race and
arrest rates. All of these are currently highly controversial topics which some may find anxiety-inducing.

--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the
remaining questions in this section.


[.answer]
--

The dataset relates to people.

--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age,
gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are
identified and provide a description of their respective
distributions within the dataset.


[.answer]
--

The data breaks the population of each US state (with the exception of Florida) down by race, specifically
identifying the white and black subpopulations.

--
[.question.common]
Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more
natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in
combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please
describe how.


[.answer]
--

It is not possible to identify any individuals from this dataset; no references to specific individuals are made.

--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered
sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals racial or ethnic
origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political
opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health
data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government
identification, such as social security numbers; criminal
history)? If so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--

The dataset contains no information that would be sensitive to specific individuals.

--
[.question.required]
Any other comments?


[.answer]
--

None.

[.datasheet]
== Process Collection

As with the previous section, dataset creators should read
through these questions prior to any data collection to flag
potential issues and then provide answers once collection is
complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the
answers to questions here may provide information that allow
others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.


[.answer]
--

The data was acquired from an ACLU research report entitled "A Tale of Two Countries - Racially Targeted arrests
in the Era of Marijuana Reform", which obtained its data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program.

--
[.question.required]
What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
(e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
procedures validated?


[.answer]
--

The data was collected directly from a pdf published by the ACLU. A Python script was used to convert it into a .csv file
which could be read by Google sheets.

--
[.question.required]
If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
specific sampling probabilities)?


[.answer]
--

The dataset is not a sample of a larger set.

--
[.question.common]
Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g.,
students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they
compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?


[.answer]
--

This dataset was created by student volunteers at Brown University from a parent dataset whose datasheet should provide information about collection.


--
[.question.required]
Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe
match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the
instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not,
please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with
the instances was created.


[.answer]
--

The data was collected into this dataset from the ACLU report in January 2021. The ACLU compiled the report in 2020.
The drug arrest and population data reflects values from 2018, and the marijuana legalization data reflects values that were true
as of March 2020.

--
[.question.common]
Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an
institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description
of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a
link or other access point to any supporting documentation.


[.answer]
--

Creating this dataset did not undergo ethics review. The assumption is
that the original dataset was suitably guarded.


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the
remainder of the questions in this section.


[.answer]
--

The dataset relates to people in general, but never makes mention of specific individuals.

--
[.question.optional]
Did you collect the data from the individuals in question
directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g.,
websites)?


[.answer]
--

The data was obtained through an ACLU report, which obtained it from the FBI’s uniform crime reporting program.

--
[.question.optional]
Were the individuals in question notified about the data
collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or
other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or
other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language
of the notification itself.


[.answer]
--

The dataset does not contain any information pertaining to specific individuals, so no individuals were notified.

--
[.question.optional]
Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and
use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with
screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and
provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or
otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals
consented.


[.answer]
--

N/A

--
[.question.optional]
If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals
provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future
or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well
as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if
appropriate).


[.answer]
--

N/A


--
[.question.optional]
Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its
use on data subjects (e.g., a data protection impact
analysis)been conducted? If so, please provide a description of
this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other
access point to any supporting documentation.


[.answer]
--

No such analysis has been conducted.

--
[.question.optional]
Any other comments?


[.answer]
--

None.

== Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any
preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers
once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are
intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they
need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in
ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example,
text that has been converted into a “bag of words” is not
suitable for tasks involving word order.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g.,
discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech
tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances,
processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a
description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions
in this section.


[.answer]
--

Very little preprocessing was performed; the only preprocessing that occurred involved combining two tables from the ACLU report 
together, and replacing empty cells with the string "No".

--
[.question.required]
Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the
preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated
future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point
to the “raw” data.


[.answer]
--

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ppHocAajV2rq2l2uq9bSn4xDq3z6qv6F/view?usp=sharing

--
[.question.required]
Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances
available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.


[.answer]
--

All preprocessing was done within Google Sheets.

--
[.question.required]
Any other comments?


[.answer]
--

None.

[.datasheet]
== Uses

These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to
reflect on the tasks for which the dataset should and should not
be used. By explicitly highlighting these tasks, dataset creators
can help dataset consumers to make informed decisions, thereby
avoiding potential risks or harms.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--

The dataset has not been used for any tasks as of January 14, 2021.

--
[.question.required]
Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or
systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or
other access point.


[.answer]
--

XXX no answer.


--
[.question.required]
What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?


[.answer]
--

The dataset could be used for essentially study of the relationship between the racial makeup of a population and
marijuana-related arrests, as well as comparing the impact of marijuana legalization and decriminalization on crime rates.

--
[.question.required]
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
harms?


[.answer]
--

The legalization dates listed are only true as of March 2020. Any future users should research recent marijuana legalization events 
and amend the dataset accordingly before performing an analysis.

Additionally, users should be aware that data for the state of Florida was not included, and remember to not generalize findings 
from this dataset to all 50 US states, as only 49 are represented.


--
[.question.required]
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--

The dataset only reflects values for 49 US states, and holds data for two races. It should not be treated as a general analysis
of worldwide marijuana use, as the laws, regulations, and culture surrounding marijuana use vary greatly by country. It should also
not be generalized to other races such as Latinxs.

Additionally, this data should not be used to imply any causality between the legalization of marijuana and any changes in arrest
rates. That sort of analysis would, at minimum, require the dataset to include data for each state both prior to and after the 
legalization of marijuana.

[.question.required]
Any other comments?


[.answer]

Page 17-20

--
[.question.common]
Will the dataset be updated (e.g., to correct labeling errors,
add new instances, delete instances)? If so, please describe how
often, by whom, and how updates will be communicated to users
(e.g., mailing list, GitHub)?


[.answer]
--

This derivative dataset is not expected to be actively updated, and
therefore quite likely will not track changes made to the original
dataset. However, changes may be made in response to feedback from
users or finding errors. Significant changes will be announced on
Bootstrap teacher support forums.


--
[.question.optional]
If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits
on the retention of the data associated with the instances (e.g.,
were individuals in question told that their data would be
retained for a fixed period of time and then deleted)? If so,
please describe these limits and explain how they will be
enforced.


[.answer]
--

Concerns emailed to contact@@bootstrapworld.org will be addressed.
