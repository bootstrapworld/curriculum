[.datasheet]
== Composition

Dataset creators should read through the questions in this
section prior to any data collection and then provide answers
once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended
to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific
tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
(e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
description.


[.answer]
--
The instances that comprise the dataset represent video games, which are the only type of instance in this data set.


--
[.question.required]
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
appropriate)?


[.answer]
--
There are 509 instances in total.


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).


[.answer]
--
The data set does not contain all possible instances. The data set is a sample from the larger set of video games. The sample is not representative of the larger set, as we can assume that esportsearnings.com is biased towards games that have an active esports scene because it is a resource crowdsourced from individuals interested in esports. Thus, games that have had no tournaments are less likely to be included in the data set.


--
[.question.required]
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--
For each instance, we include the release date of the game as a Number, the predominant genre of the game as a String, the total earnings of all tournament winners as a Number, the earnings that were won through online-only tournaments as a Number, the total number of tournament winners as a Number, and the total number of tournaments as a Number. All data, save the release date and genre, were obtained by summing the statistics of each tournament that took place for a given game.
--
[.question.optional]
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--

Ad rem est vero cum ratione. Optio dolor molestiae consequatur
perferendis sint amet eligendi. Minus unde odit quod officia sit
ut impedit facilis. Voluptatum alias illo et dolore impedit aut
vitae qui. Laborum itaque ipsa possimus et.


--
[.question.required]
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
please provide a description, explaining why this information is
missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
redacted text.


[.answer]
--
No information is missing from individual instances.


--
[.question.required]
Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
(e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
describe how these relationships are made explicit.


[.answer]
--
No relationships between individual instances are explicitly stated.
--
[.question.optional]
Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
them.


[.answer]
--

Ad rem est vero cum ratione. Optio dolor molestiae consequatur
perferendis sint amet eligendi. Minus unde odit quod officia sit

--
[.question.required]
Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
dataset? If so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
Errors are possible, as the information is crowdsourced. However, for the same reason, blatant errors are improbable, especially for more popular titles.


--
[.question.common]
Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
provide descriptions of all external resources and any
restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
access points, as appropriate.


[.answer]
--
The data set is fully self-contained.


--
[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered
confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or
by doctorpatient confidentiality, data that includes the content
of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide
a description.


[.answer]
--
All data was obtained from esportsearnings.com, which asserts that all data is "freely available public information."


--
[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might
be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause
anxiety? If so, please describe why.


[.answer]
--
The data set does not contain data that might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety.

== Process Collection

As with the previous section, dataset creators should read
through these questions prior to any data collection to flag
potential issues and then provide answers once collection is
complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the
answers to questions here may provide information that allow
others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.


[.answer]
--
The data associated with each instance was freely available online.


--
[.question.required]
What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
(e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
procedures validated?


[.answer]
--
The data was manually submitted by users on esportsearnings.com. Submitted data is subject to review by other users, and all submitted data must be accompanied by a reliable citation.


--
[.question.required]
If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
specific sampling probabilities)?


[.answer]
--
There was no predefined sampling strategy, as the composition of the sample depended solely on the submissions of users on esportsearnings.com.


--
[.question.common]
Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g.,
students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they
compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?


[.answer]
--
Users on esportsearnings.com who chose to volunteer their time were involved in the data collection process.


--
[.question.required]
Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe
match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the
instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not,
please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with
the instances was created.


[.answer]
--
Data collection began with the inception of the site, which was in 2012. It is an ongoing process. The timeframe over which the data was collected does not match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances. The timeframe for data creation was from 1998 to 2020.


--
[.question.common]
Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an
institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description
of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a
link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

== Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any
preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers
once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are
intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they
need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in
ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example,
text that has been converted into a “bag of words” is not
suitable for tasks involving word order.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g.,
discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech
tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances,
processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a
description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions
in this section.


[.answer]
--
The names of the video games were cleaned to fix any unicode characters that did not display properly.


--
[.question.required]
Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the
preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated
future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point
to the “raw” data.


[.answer]
--
The original data set upon which this data set is based can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/esports-earnings.


--
[.question.required]
Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances
available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.


[.answer]
--
The cleaning of the names column was done in Google Sheets (https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).


--
[.question.required]
Any other comments?


[.answer]
--
The instances that were formatted incorrectly were in cells A129, A200, A290, and A507.

[.datasheet]
== Uses

These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to
reflect on the tasks for which the dataset should and should not
be used. By explicitly highlighting these tasks, dataset creators
can help dataset consumers to make informed decisions, thereby
avoiding potential risks or harms.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--
A few users on Kaggle have conducted analyses with the source data set in an attempt to find relationships between variables in the data set.


--
[.question.required]
Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or
systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or
other access point.


[.answer]
--

--
[.question.required]
What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?


[.answer]
--
The data set could be used to determine the factors that affect the total amount of money awarded to tournament winners, which is representative to the strength of a game's esports scene. These factors could include genre, release date, the ratio of online earnings to total earnings, etc.


--
[.question.required]
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
harms?


[.answer]
--
There is nothing about the composition of the data set or the way it was collected that might impact future uses.


--
[.question.required]
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
There are no tasks for which the data set should not be used.


--
[.question.required]
Any other comments?


[.answer]
--
The user of the data set must be careful not to conflate the esports scene of a game with the quality of the game, as there are many factors, including whether or not the game is free, that affect how much money is awarded in tournaments.
