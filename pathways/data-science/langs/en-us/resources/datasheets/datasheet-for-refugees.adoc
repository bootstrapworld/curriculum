--
[.question.required]
For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific
task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
Please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
The dataset has been created to help identify countries that produce a significant percentage of the world’s refugees and help pinpoint “push factors” of refugees. The dataset is meant to expose students to the plight of refugees, educate students on the distribution of refugees’ countries of origin over regions of the world, and be a starting point on which change could be instigated effectively.


--
[.question.required]
Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and
on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution,
organization)?


[.answer]
--
Sophia Liu, an undergraduate student at Brown University, created this dataset for the Bootstrap Data Science Curriculum through Bootstrap coordinator Ms. Flannery Denny.


--
[.question.optional]
Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an

== Composition

Dataset creators should read through the questions in this
section prior to any data collection and then provide answers
once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended
to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific
tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
(e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
description.


[.answer]
--
This dataset is composed of one type of instance. The instances are, namely, countries of the world.


--
[.question.required]
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
appropriate)?


[.answer]
--
There are 152 instances (countries).


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).


[.answer]
--
The dataset contains a sample of instances from a larger set. The larger set would encompass every country of the world, but this dataset only includes countries’ with available data – countries that were present in all of the sources I used for the dataset. 


--
[.question.required]
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--
Each instance consists of raw data (unprocessed text).


--
[.question.optional]
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
N/A


--
[.question.required]
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
please provide a description, explaining why this information is
missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
redacted text.


[.answer]
--
No information missing.


--
[.question.required]
Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
(e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
describe how these relationships are made explicit.


[.answer]
--
Each instance on the dataset is an individual country of the world.


--
[.question.optional]
Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
them.


[.answer]
--
N/A


--
[.question.required]
Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
dataset? If so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
No.


--
[.question.common]
Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
provide descriptions of all external resources and any
restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
access points, as appropriate.

--
The dataset is self-contained.

There is an archival version of the complete dataset from which this
one was created.

The dataset is released under a CC BY-NC-SA license. Any other uses
require express permission from the Bootstrap team.

[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered
confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or
by doctorpatient confidentiality, data that includes the content
of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide
a description.

The dataset does not contain any confidential information.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might
be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause
anxiety? If so, please describe why.

[.question.required]
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the
remaining questions in this section.


[.answer]
--
Yes, it relates to people.


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age,
gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are
identified and provide a description of their respective
distributions within the dataset.


[.answer]
--
Yes. The subpopulations are the refugees originating from each country. These subpopulations are identified by a percentage: the number of refugees from the given country over the number of total refugees in the world. Their respective distributions within the dataset are in the column for the percent share of global refugees originating from each country.


--
[.question.common]
Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more
natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in
combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please

== Process Collection

As with the previous section, dataset creators should read
through these questions prior to any data collection to flag
potential issues and then provide answers once collection is
complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the
answers to questions here may provide information that allow
others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.


[.answer]
--
The data was aggreated manually from five sources: four datasets from Gapminder and one pdf from The Economist. The Gapminder datasets were already on google sheets, so I copied the columns I needed into my dataset and tidied the data. The pdf, however, did not come with a pre-made google sheets; it listed the countries under each democracy category: “full democracy”, “flawed democracy”, “hybrid regime” and “authoritarian." I manually inputted the democracy category of each country into my dataset.


--
[.question.required]
What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
(e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
procedures validated?


[.answer]
--
The procedure used to collect data was manual human curation. All columns except "Region" were untouched data from the sources mentioned before.

The data in the column "Region" was not sourced from any external dataset. I manually assigned each country in this dataset to a region of the world among the following regions: Africa, Asia, Central America, Europe, Middle East, North America, Oceania, and South America. In other words, I added Central America and the Middle East to the continents of the world (excluding Antarctica). I added these two regions because they were significantly different, in terms of human development and political stability, from the regions in which they were previously included.


--
[.question.required]
If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
specific sampling probabilities)?


[.answer]
--
The sampling strategy was only including the countries that had available data for the following columns of the dataset:
"Percent of global population"
"Percent of global refugees originating from country"
"Personal security index"
"Democracy category"
"Civil liberties index"
"Human development index"


--
[.question.common]
Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g.,
students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they
compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?

This dataset was created by student volunteers at Brown University from a parent dataset whose datasheet should provide information about collection.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe
match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the
instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not,
please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with
the instances was created.


[.answer]
--
The data was collected in the month of December-January 2020. The timeframe of the data is 2018.


--
[.question.common]
Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an
institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description
of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a
link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

Creating this dataset did not undergo ethics review. The assumption is
that the original dataset was suitably guarded.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the
remainder of the questions in this section.


[.answer]
--
No, I did not collect the data from individual people.

== Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any
preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers
once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are
intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they
need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in
ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example,
text that has been converted into a “bag of words” is not
suitable for tasks involving word order.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g.,
discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech
tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances,
processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a
description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions
in this section.


[.answer]
--
Yes, tidying of the data was done. I removed instances that did not have available data for the columns in my dataset.


--
[.question.required]
Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the
preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated
future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point
to the “raw” data.


[.answer]
--
Yes. The raw data came from four sources on Gapminder’s website and one source from The Economist.
1. Dataset on the percentage share of global refugees originating from each country.
2. Dataset on democracy indices of countries. The specific sheet from the dataset: personal integrity & security.
3. Dataset on the civil liberty indices of countries.
4. Dataset on the human development indices of countries.
5. Dataset on the democracy category of countries.

== Uses

These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to
reflect on the tasks for which the dataset should and should not
be used. By explicitly highlighting these tasks, dataset creators
can help dataset consumers to make informed decisions, thereby
avoiding potential risks or harms.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--
Yes. This dataset has been used by its creator to make a sample research paper. In this paper, the dataset was used to find the top countries from which refugees originate, as well as similarities and differences between these countries. The paper also analyzed how these top countries (and others) fared in personal security and human development scores.


--
[.question.required]
Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or
systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or
other access point.


[.answer]
--
Yes, there is a google drive folder here: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/168Me_fsZ1BonWYelhW54uuRemCLInFLRGjf3ei9HnWo/edit?usp=sharing.


--
[.question.required]
What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?


[.answer]
--
The dataset could be used to compare the personal security and civil liberty scores of regions of the world (i.e. comparing Europe and North America, or Africa and Asia, etc). The dataset could also be used to identify outliers and possibly identify factors that made them outliers.


--
[.question.required]
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
harms?


[.answer]
--
Future users need to be aware of the list of countries excluded (listed in the Readme) from the dataset and the few countries that have debatable region categorizations (also listed in the Readme). Before reaching conclusions, future users should check if these omissions and categorizations change their findings.


--
[.question.required]
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
The dataset should not be used to stereotype refugees or people from specific countries. The dataset should also not be used without acknowledging the presence of gaps in the data (i.e. resulting from excluding some countries).
