= Teacher Resources for Data Science

== Essentials
- *Implementation Options* [@link{pages/implementation-options.html, link}] Bootstrap:Data Science was designed to be flexible, allowing for implementations in Middle and High School ranging from 1-week exposures to full-year courses! Find recommendations for the course structure that's right for you.
- *Online Community (Discourse)* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share out ideas!
- *Collection of Bootstrap:Data Science Desmos Activities* [@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5fc9250afcaa3f30f4946746, link}] - All of our Desmos Data Science lessons, in one place.
- *Contracts* [@link{solution-pages/contracts.pdf, link}] - A PDF of the contracts pages from the back of the student workbook.
- *Glossary* [@link{../../../Glossary.shtml?pathway=data-science, link}] - All of the vocabulary words (and their definitions) used in this pathway.
- *Bilingual Glossary of Bootstrap Terms (English-Spanish)* [@link{../../../lib/bilingual-glossary.html, PDF}] - For teachers with ELL/ESL students, we provide a bilingual glossary for all of the terms used across our curriculum library.
- *Blank Design Recipe Worksheet* - [@dist-link{blanks/2-blank-pyret-recipes.pdf, PDF}] - When students need scaffolding for defining a function.
- *Blank Data Cycle Worksheet* - [@dist-link{blanks/2-blank-data-cycles.pdf, PDF}] - When students need scaffolding for answering a question with data.


== Starter Files
Many of our lessons have their own starter files, linked from the materials section of each lesson plan. Below is a collated list of all the starter files from across the curriculum.

@starter-file-list

== Projects
Working in pairs, students complete different projects as they explore their own datasets. These datasets can be collected by students themselves, or chosen from our library.

@all-projects

**Multi-Lesson, Capstone Projects**

- *Exploration Paper* - Students begin by exploring their dataset, generating charts and coming up with possible research questions. The end product is the @starter-file{exploration-paper}. You can find the description of this project (and the grading rubric!) at @lesson-link{project-exploration-paper/, the Exploration Paper page}.

- *Research Paper* - Once students have come up with a research question, they can continue on to the complete @starter-file{research-paper}. You can find the description of this project (and the grading rubric!) at @lesson-link{project-research-paper, the Research Paper page}.

- *Datasets to Choose From* - Students can import their own data into a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1hsALf5oOrWqrolayPIgIlYXrqk3i-vD5, Blank Starter File} following instruction in @link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4n9hTSqcyw, this tutorial video} or choose from one of the many provided datasets below:
