- *Online Community (Discourse)* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Want to ask a question or pose a lesson idea for other Bootstrap teachers? Want to be kept up-to-date about Bootstrap events, workshops, and curricular changes? Our new discussion forum is the place to do it.

- *Implementation Options* - looking to integrate Bootstrap:Data Science into your classroom? There are @link{pages/implementation-options.adoc, implementation guides} for teachers looking to fill a week's worth of time, or a full-year course!
-
- *Contracts* [@link{solution-pages/contracts.pdf, file}] - a reference PDF of just the contracts pages from the back of the student workbook.

- *Collection of Bootstrap:Data Science Desmos Activities* [@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5fc9250afcaa3f30f4946746, link}] - Love Desmos as much as we do? We have plenty of Desmos activities infused throughout our Data Science lessons, and you can explore all of them in one place.

- *What's Going on in this Graph?* [@link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, nytimes.com}] - Once a week, the NYTimes posts an interesting data visualization. This is a great resource to spark the curiosity of young data scientists, and make for a perfect Notice &amp; Wonder activity!

- *The Pudding* [@link{https://pudding.cool/, link}] - Terrific deep dives into data analysis for interesting topics. Another wonderful resource for students, with great animations showing the transformation of how data is visualized as the research questions evolve.

- *"How Not To"* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/t/something-fun-for-the-classroom-hownotto/1459/9, Discourse.org}] - We regularly post to social media under the hashtag ``#HowNotTo`, taking a few friendly potshots are examples of terrible Data Science out there. Over on our teacher discussion board, we've kept a running tally of all of them!

- *"Same Stats, Different Graphs"* - [@link{https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs, autodesk.com}] - A wonderful illustration of why it's so important to see the _shape_ of data, and not just focus on the descriptive statistics.

- *Guess the Correlation* [@link{http://guessthecorrelation.com/, link}] - a game-ified resource for building intuition for correlation, based on randomly-generated scatterplots.

- *Box Plots and Histograms* [@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1q_yHgXVUHMeqVfdEuWotGXy4k149ecqZ&v=1904b2c, link} This starter file is designed such that the data in each column has a different shape and spread to support teachers looking to facilitate class discussions with a wide range of examples readily available at once.

== Project Files

Every student (or, ideally, every __pair__ of students) will need to save a copy of the @link{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZEIgM4zvxI7JizViVFZojnpd3Yr2rYe8puPk8pjOcs/copy, Blank Research Paper}. A @link{pages/final-paper-rubric.adoc, Grading Rubric} is also available for the research paper.

We have also compiled some @link{about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.adoc, notes on these datasets}, which we recommend for all teachers before having their students choose a dataset.

@include{../lessons/choosing-your-dataset/fragments/dataset-table.adoc}

Students can also import their data into a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=12v7kzbxHt2LaSe2uI2d_OnssxtTNF0A8, Blank Starter File}. They will need to modify this file for use with their dataset, and @link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4n9hTSqcyw, this tutorial video} can walk them through it.

- *Broadening Participation* [@link{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17uEl-yS2smjSuOdDLJPzMWWffeXTqBsENjAaZe_qkso/view, Google Slides}] - Making computing relevant, accessible and welcoming to all students isn't a pipe-dream. Like anything else worth doing, it takes some good practice and a desire to do it right and keep improving. We've put together some pointers based on best-practices from the CS-Education literature, for Bootstrap teachers or anyone looking to broaden participation in Computer Science.
