== Resources that Pair Well with Bootstrap:Data Science

- @link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's Going on in this Graph?} - weekly intriguing data visualizations by the New York Times

- @link{https://pudding.cool/, The Pudding} - fascinating, data-rich visual essays explaining ideas debated in culture

- @link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/t/something-fun-for-the-classroom-hownotto/1459/9, How Not To} - friendly potshots at terrible Data Science, regularly posted to social media under the hashtag "HowNotTo"

- @link{https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs, Same Stats, Different Graphs} - an illustration from Autodesk of why we must see the shape of data and not just focus on the descriptive statistics

- @link{http://guessthecorrelation.com/, Guess the Correlation} - a game-ified resource (built by Omar Wagih) for building intuition for correlation, based on randomly-generated scatterplots

- @link{https://www.geogebra.org/m/ZcVIxKtF, Sensitive r} - an applet from Geogebra that shows how changing a single point can change the correlation coefficient r

=== Capstone Project(s)
Working in pairs, students complete two different projects as they explore their own datasets.

Our entire dataset library is listed below:

@include{../../../lessons/choosing-your-dataset/fragments/dataset-table.adoc}

*Dataset Tips* [@link{../../../lessons/choosing-your-dataset/about-datasets/for-teachers-about-datasets.html, link}]- We have also compiled some notes on our provided datasets, which we recommend for all teachers before having their students choose a dataset.

Students can also import their own data into a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=12v7kzbxHt2LaSe2uI2d_OnssxtTNF0A8, Blank Starter File}. They will need to modify this file for use with their dataset, and @link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4n9hTSqcyw, this tutorial video} can walk them through it.

- **Exploration Paper** - Students begin by exploring their dataset, generating charts and coming up with possible research questions. The end product is the @starter-file{exploration-paper}. You can find the description of this project (and the grading rubric!) at @link{../../../lessons/project-exploration-paper, the Exploration Project Page}.

- **Research Paper** - Once students have come up with a research question, they can continue on to the complete @starter-file{research-paper}. You can find the description of this project (and the grading rubric!) at @link{../../../lessons/project-research-paper, the Research Project Page}.
