- @link{../lessons/threats-to-validity/pages/threats-to-validity-project.adoc, Threats to Validity Project} - Students pretend to be terrible data scientists who develop and support a claim based on faulty sampling techniques (selection bias, sample size problems, sampling errors, confounding variables).

== Resources that Pair Well with Bootstrap:Data Science

- @link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's Going on in this Graph?} - weekly intriguing data visualizations by the New York Times

- @link{https://pudding.cool/, The Pudding} - fascinating, data-rich visual essays explaining ideas debated in culture

- @link{https://www.geogebra.org/m/ZcVIxKtF, Sensitive r} - an applet from Geogebra that shows how changing a single point can change the correlation coefficient r


== Research Paper Files

Every student (or, ideally, every __pair__ of students) will need to save a copy of the @link{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZEIgM4zvxI7JizViVFZojnpd3Yr2rYe8puPk8pjOcs/copy, Blank Research Paper}. A @link{pages/final-paper-rubric.adoc, Grading Rubric} is also available for the research paper.

@include{../lessons/choosing-your-dataset/fragments/dataset-table.adoc}

Students can also import their data into a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=12v7kzbxHt2LaSe2uI2d_OnssxtTNF0A8, Blank Starter File}. They will need to modify this file for use with their dataset, and @link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4n9hTSqcyw, this tutorial video} can walk them through it.
