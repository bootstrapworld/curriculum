//Write a brief description of where this data comes from.
//Examples:
//
//- This dataset includes data from 271 Rhode Island public &
//  charter schools. 
//- This data set looks at traffic stops in Durham, NC
//  between 2002 and 2013, recording the number of them that resulted in searches of the person
//  stopped. Data is broken down by age, race and sex.

--
//Write one of the following descriptors in the space below:
//
//- This data set has a limited number of categories, making it
//  accessible to any student.
//- This data set has a huge number of columns that will excite
//  some students and may overwhelm others.
--


[.answer]
--
This data set has a limited number of categories, making it
accessible to any student.


--
[.question]
--
//Write one of the following descriptors in the space below:
//
//- The columns of this data set are defined to allow students to
//  start analysis without much additional coding.
//- The columns of this data set require calculations to convert
//  data before students start making graphs.
--


[.answer]
--
The columns of this dataset may require additional coding depending on how the student wishes to analyze the data.

[.question]
*Column Titles*
//List columns below.


[.answer]
--
State, Venue, Most recent builder, Ranks, Stops, Manuals, Lowest Pitch, Year Completed, Altered


--
[.question]
*Have students...*
--
//Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
//to deepen the analysis. For example:
//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school. 
//- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
//  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

--
— *define* a function average-ranks-wurlitzer, which takes the average number of ranks for all organs made by Wurlitzer. Do this for a few of these major organ companies as well: Austin, Noack, Hook & Hastings, Möller, Casavant, and Aeolian-Skinner.
— *define* a function ranks-stops-difference which computes the difference between an organ's number of ranks and its number of stops.

//If there are outliers teachers should be aware of, please note them below. For example:
//
//- *Outliers to be aware of:* Only a few films are from before 2000.
//- *Outlier to be aware of:* Classical High School has test scores of zero.

--
- *Outlier to be aware of:* Organ 131 is the largest pipe organ in the world.
- *Outliers to be aware of:* Only a few organs are not currently in the United States
- *Outliers to be aware of:* Organs 2253 and 66436 are comparatively old


--
[.question]
--
//List any recommended calculations below. For example:
//
//- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
//  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
//  percentages would need to be calculated.
//- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
//  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.
--


[.answer]
--
No additional calculations should be necessary.
