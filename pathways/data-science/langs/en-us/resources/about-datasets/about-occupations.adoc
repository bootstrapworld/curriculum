//Write a brief description of where this data comes from.
//Examples:
//
//- This dataset includes data from 271 Rhode Island public &
//  charter schools.
//- This data set looks at traffic stops in Durham, NC
//  between 2002 and 2013, recording the number of them that resulted in searches of the person
//  stopped. Data is broken down by age, race and sex.

This dataset includes data about 140 occupations in the U.S. in 2019.
For each occupation, this dataset records its occupation type, total number of employees, percentage of non-white employees, percentage of female employees, typical entry level educational requirement, annual median wage, weekly median wage, and female weekly median wage.

//Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
//to deepen the analysis. For example:
//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school.
//- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
//  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

- *define* a function gender-wage-gap, which computes the numerical difference 
	between female employees' weekly median wage and all employees' weekly median wage.
- *define* a function female-wage-is-lower, which returns true if an occupation offers 
	female employees a wage comparatively lower wage.

*Heads Up*

//If there are outliers teachers should be aware of, please note them below. For example:
//
//- *Outliers to be aware of:* Only a few films are from before 2000.

//List any recommended calculations below. For example:
//
//- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
//  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
//  percentages would need to be calculated.
//- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
//  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.

- Columns list the median wage for all employees and median wage 
	for female employees. In order to look into gender income equality, 
	wage gap would need to be calculated.
- Other than looking at the dataset as a whole, we can create subsets 
	(e.g. occupations that have the same educational requirement,
	occupations that belong to the same type, etc.) 
	and make comparisons between subsets.
