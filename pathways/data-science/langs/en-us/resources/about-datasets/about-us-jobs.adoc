//Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
//to deepen the analysis. For example:
//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school.
//- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
//  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

//List any recommended calculations below. For example:
//
//- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
//  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
//  percentages would need to be calculated.
//- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
//  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.
