//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school.

Functions that Return Booleans:
*define* a function little-liberty, which returns true if a country has a civil liberties index between 6 and 7.
*define* a function much-liberty, which returns true if a country has a civil liberties index between 1 and 2.
*define* a function little-security, which returns true if a country’s personal security index is less than 40.
*define* a function much-security, which returns true if a country’s personal security index is greater than 60.
*define* a function little-development, which returns true if a country’s human development index is less than 0.4.
*define* a function much-development, which returns true if a country’s human development index is greater than 0.6.
*define* a function high-indices, which returns true for a given country if, using that country as an input, much-liberty, much-security, and much-development all return true.

Functions that Return Tables:
*define* a function africa-only, which returns the rows of a table that have “Africa” as the value in the Region column.
*define* a function asia-only, which returns the rows of a table that have “Asia” as the value in the Region column.
And so on.

Functions that Return Numbers:
*define* a function pct-high-africa, which returns the percentage of Africa countries that, inputted into high-indices, return true.
*define* a function pct-high-asia, which returns the percentage of Asian countries that, inputted into high-indices, return true.
*define* a function pct-high-mideast, which returns the percentage of Middle Eastern countries that, inputted into high-indices, return true.
And so on.

//List any recommended calculations below. For example:
//
//- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
//  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
//  percentages would need to be calculated.
//- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
//  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.
