//Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
//to deepen the analysis. For example:
//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school. 
//- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
//  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

Have students

- *define* a function online-ratio, which returns the ratio of online-earnings to total-earnings for a game.

- *define* a function annual-earnings, which returns the average earnings per year since the release date for a game.

//If there are outliers teachers should be aware of, please note them below. For example:
//
//- *Outliers to be aware of:* Only a few films are from before 2000.
//- *Outlier to be aware of:* Classical High School has test scores of zero.

Note that since the data is publicly sourced, there are games with no earnings and no tournaments. Additionally, the nature of the data means that there are a few extremely large outliers that the student will have to deal with when analyzing the data.

[.question]

//List any recommended calculations below. For example:
//
//- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
//  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
//  percentages would need to be calculated.
//- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
//  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.

The data for many less popular games varies greatly due to one-off tournaments. Additionally, the number of games with zero tournaments and zero players may vary, as the data is publicly sourced. Thus, it is recommended that comparisons between genres be done with subsets containing the games with the highest earnings, as much more data is available for those games.

Other metrics that may be interesting to the student for analysis are the average earnings per year since release and the average number of tournaments per year since the release year of the game or 1998--whichever comes second.

[.question]
//Any other comments?

[.answer]
--
Keep in mind that the data only includes tournaments that occur from 1998 to 2020, even though some of the games included in the data set were released before 1998.
