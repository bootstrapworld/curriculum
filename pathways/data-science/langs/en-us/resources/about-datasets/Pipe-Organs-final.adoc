== Motivation

The questions in this section are primarily intended to encourage
dataset creators to clearly articulate their reasons for creating
the dataset and to promote transparency about funding interests.


[.answer]
--
This dataset was created to expand the set of datasets in the possesion of the Bootstrap Data Science curriculum.

--
[.question.required]
For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific
task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
Please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
This dataset was created for educational purposes. The pipe organ is a relatively obscure instrument, and this dataset is intended to provoke an interest in it.


--
[.question.required]
Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and
on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution,
organization)?


[.answer]
--
{empty}E. C. Holtz and J. Sobel created this dataset on behalf of Bootstrap.


--
[.question.optional]
Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an
associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the
grant name and number.


[.answer]
--
This dataset was provided by volunteer effort, and there is no funding involved.


--
[.question.required]
Any other comments?


[.answer]
--
No compensation was provided for those who submitted data to the dataset of which this dataset is a sample; all data was compiled by organ enthusiasts who simply want an organ database.


--


[.datasheet]
== Composition

Dataset creators should read through the questions in this
section prior to any data collection and then provide answers
once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended
to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific
tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
(e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
description.


[.answer]
--
The instances of this dataset are individual pipe organs.


--
[.question.required]
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
appropriate)?


[.answer]
--
There are 500 instances of pipe organs. 


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).


[.answer]
--
This dataset contains a small fraction of the original 66,018 instances of pipe organs from the Organ Historical Society's Pipe Organ Database. Pipe organs without stoplists were excluded from the sample taken, as not all data in the columns could be collected without a stoplist. This reduced the number of organs that could be sampled to 19,042. 


--
[.question.required]
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--
Each instance consists of text representing the state wherein it resides (or Non-US), text representing the type of institution/location wherein it resides, text representing the original builder of the organ, a number representing the number of ranks (sets of pipes spanning the entire range of a manual/the pedalboard), a number representing the number of stops (usually one rank, but sometimes groups of ranks, which can be selected by the organist to be mixed to create a particular sound), number of manuals (keyboards), a number representing the lowest pitch (written as the length of what the lowest pipe would be if it were an open tube), a number representing the year the organ was originally completed, and a boolean representing whether the organ has been modified or restored since its completion.


--
[.question.optional]
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
The label associated with each organ is the Pipe Organ Database's ID number for that particular organ.


--
[.question.required]
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
please provide a description, explaining why this information is
missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
redacted text.


[.answer]
--
No information is missing from any instances.


--
[.question.required]
Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
(e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please
describe how these relationships are made explicit.


[.answer]
--
No instances are related to any others in this dataset.


--
[.question.optional]
Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
them.


[.answer]
--
When splitting data, the user should be mindful of the fact that theater organs vary greatly from other organs, and that there are more subtle variations among organs of different builders.


--
[.question.required]
Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
dataset? If so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
Sometimes, the listed number of stops disagrees with the number listed on the stoplist. In these cases, the one listed directly on the page is the one entered into the dataset.

This dataset in its entirety is not intended for an analysis of the prolificness of any organbuilder. In order to use this dataset for that purpose, remove the first four and last four organs fromt his dataset, as they were selected as organs of note and not sampled with Simple Random Sampling. 

Also, the parent dataset relies on self-reporting of existing organs. This means that organs in certain regions may be underrepresented.


--
[.question.common]
Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other
datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over
time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete
dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed
at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any
restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the
external resources that might apply to a future user? Please
provide descriptions of all external resources and any
restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other
access points, as appropriate.

--
The dataset is self-contained.

There is an archival version of the complete dataset from which this
one was created.

The dataset is released under a CC BY-NC-SA license. Any other uses
require express permission from the Bootstrap team.
--


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered
confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or
by doctorpatient confidentiality, data that includes the content
of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide
a description.

The dataset does not contain any confidential information.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.common]
Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might
be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause
anxiety? If so, please describe why.

The dataset does not contain any content known or intended to be
offensive.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the
remaining questions in this section.


[.answer]
--
This dataset does not relate to people aside from most organbuilders' names being the names of their companies.



--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age,
gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are
identified and provide a description of their respective
distributions within the dataset.


[.answer]
--

XXX: missing answer.

== Process Collection

As with the previous section, dataset creators should read
through these questions prior to any data collection to flag
potential issues and then provide answers once collection is
complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the
answers to questions here may provide information that allow
others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.


[.answer]
--
The data in this dataset was recorded in the Organ Historical Society's Pipe Organ Database. Stop counts could be verified by stoplists, but no organs were directly observed in the coellction of this data.


--
[.question.required]
What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
(e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
procedures validated?


[.answer]
--
This data was mostly collected by a web scraper scraping the database, but eight manually curated organs of note were included.


--
[.question.required]
If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
specific sampling probabilities)?


[.answer]
--
The first four  and last four organs in the dataset are organs of note. The rest were collected by Simple Random Sampling.


--
[.question.common]
Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g.,
students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they
compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?


[.answer]
--
This data was collected by two student volunteers who were not compensated monetarily.


--
[.question.required]
Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe
match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the
instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not,
please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with
the instances was created.


[.answer]
--
This data was collected in December 2020/January 2021. It does not match the creation timeframe of the data in question, which started in the 1950s and is ongoing.


--
[.question.common]
Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an
institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description
of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a
link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

Creating this dataset did not undergo ethics review. The assumption is
that the original dataset was suitably guarded.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the
remainder of the questions in this section.


[.answer]
--
This dataset does not relate to people beyond the extent of their organ companies being named after them.


--
[.question.optional]
Did you collect the data from the individuals in question
directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g.,
websites)?


[.answer]
--
The data was obtained from a third party, the Pipe Organ Database, who in turn collected the data from the organ enthusiasts who directly observed the organs.


--
[.question.optional]
Were the individuals in question notified about the data
collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or
other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or
other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language
of the notification itself.


[.answer]
--



--
[.question.optional]
Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and
use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with
screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and
provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or
otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals
consented.


[.answer]
--



--
[.question.optional]
If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals
provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future
or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well
as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if
appropriate).


[.answer]
--



--
[.question.optional]
Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its
use on data subjects (e.g., a data protection impact
analysis)been conducted? If so, please provide a description of
this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other
access point to any supporting documentation.

== Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any
preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers
once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are
intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they
need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in
ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example,
text that has been converted into a “bag of words” is not
suitable for tasks involving word order.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.required]
Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g.,
discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech
tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances,
processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a
description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions
in this section.


[.answer]
--
All church organs' venues was labeled as "Church", rather than being listed by denomination.


--
[.question.required]
Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the
preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated
future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point
to the “raw” data.


[.answer]
--
The "raw" data was not saved.


--
[.question.required]
Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances
available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.

== Uses

These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to
reflect on the tasks for which the dataset should and should not
be used. By explicitly highlighting these tasks, dataset creators
can help dataset consumers to make informed decisions, thereby
avoiding potential risks or harms.


[.answer]
--
This dataset can be used for comparisons between numbers of manuals, ranks, and stops, as well as the lowest pitch of a pipe, provided that the user takes into account the fact that theater organs differ drastically from pipe organs in the difference between ranks and stops. The first four and last four elements of this dataset should not be used in any attempt to find the prolificness of any organbuilder, as they were not obtained by simple random sampling. This was to highlight certain organs of note to show the true ranges of the distributions of organ characteristics.


--
[.question.required]
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please
provide a description.


[.answer]
--
This dataset has not been used for any other tasks.


--
[.question.required]
Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or
systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or
other access point.


[.answer]
--
No such repository exists because no such papers or systems exist.


--
[.question.required]
What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?


[.answer]
--
This dataset may also be used for an analysis by year of pipe organ, for instance observing a trend in the lowest pitches or number of stops in pipe organs as time wears on.


--
[.question.required]
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
harms?


[.answer]
--
The composition of this dataset should not impact future uses.


--
[.question.required]
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
so, please provide a description.


[.answer]
--
Users should proceed with caution when using this dataset to analyze organs by venue because of the small number of non-church organs.


--
[.question.required]
Any other comments?


[.answer]
--
No other comments.

--
[.question.common]
Will the dataset be updated (e.g., to correct labeling errors,
add new instances, delete instances)? If so, please describe how
often, by whom, and how updates will be communicated to users
(e.g., mailing list, GitHub)?

This derivative dataset is not expected to be actively updated, and
therefore quite likely will not track changes made to the original
dataset. However, changes may be made in response to feedback from
users or finding errors. Significant changes will be announced on
Bootstrap teacher support forums.


[.answer]
--


--
[.question.optional]
If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits
on the retention of the data associated with the instances (e.g.,
