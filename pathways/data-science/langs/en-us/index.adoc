Looking for our *Data Literacy* materials? You can choose from the @dist-link{courses/data-literacy/, Pyret} or @dist-link{courses/data-literacy-codap/, CODAP} version of these materials.

_**Algebra 2** teachers looking to integrate only the non-linear modeling content into their classes will want our @dist-link{courses/algebra-2/, Algebra 2} materials._

== What about Non-linear Models and Algebra 2?

There's no reason the modeling work introduced in this pathway has to stop at line of best fit! Our @dist-link{courses/algebra-2/, Algebra 2} materials extend into quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, and periodic models - all using inquiries into real data as a foundation for the non-linear content! We especially recommend this extension for Data Science teachers looking to count their course as an alternative to Algebra 2.
