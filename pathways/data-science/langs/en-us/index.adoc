= Bootstrap:Data Science

@pathway-logo

These materials are appropriate for teachers of *full-year, high-school Data Science classes*, and is also designed to support those interested in *3rd-year mathematics credit*. It includes material focused on programming, statistics, civics, and ethics, along with significant lessons on _non-linear modeling_, using the quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions commonly found in 3rd-year math classes (periodic models coming this fall!).

_*Algebra 2* teachers looking to integrate only the non-linear modeling content into their classes will want our @dist-link{courses/algebra-2/, Algebra 2} materials, while those teaching earlier-grade courses or looking to *integrate Data Science* into their existing Math, Science, or History classes should look at @dist-link{courses/data-literacy/, Data Literacy}._
