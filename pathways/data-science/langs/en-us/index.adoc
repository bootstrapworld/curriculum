This course is appropriate for:
- Teachers of *full-year Data Science classes*
- Teachers who wish to use this course for 3rd-year mathematics credit

It includes all of the statistics and civics, and ethics, content from our Data Science Foundations course, as well as significant content on _modeling_, using the quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions commonly found in 3rd-year math classes.

If you are looking for something without the modeling and nonlinear content, our @dist-link{courses/data-science-foundations/, Data Science Foundations} course may be a better fit.
