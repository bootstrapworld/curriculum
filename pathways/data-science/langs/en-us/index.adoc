These materials are appropriate for teachers of *full-year, high-school Data Science classes*, and is also designed to support those interested in *3rd-year mathematics credit*. It includes all of the statistics and civics, and ethics, content from our @dist-link{courses/data-science-foundations/, Data Science Foundations} course, as well as significant content on _non-linear modeling_, using the quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions commonly found in 3rd-year math classes (periodic models coming this fall!).

_**Algebra 2** teachers looking to integrate only the non-linear modeling content into their classes will want our @dist-link{courses/data-science-foundations/, Algebra 2} materials, while those teaching earlier-grade courses or looking to **integrate Data Science** into their existing Math, Science, or History classes should look at @dist-link{courses/data-literacy/, Data Literacy}._
