= Bootstrap:AI

@pathway-logo

Bootstrap:AI is designed to complement and extend our BS:DS curriculum. This series invites students to explore decision trees, regression, clustering, and statistical language models - four commonly used machine learning methods. Students will explore the fundamentals of these methods to gain a concrete understanding of AI through applications. The first five modules are accessible even to middle-school students, while the last two are better done in high school.
