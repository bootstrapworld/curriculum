Bootstrap:AI is designed to complement and extend our @dist-link{courses/data-science/, Data Science} curriculum. This six-lesson series invites students to explore decision trees, regression, clustering, and statistical language models - four commonly used machine learning methods. Students will explore the fundamentals of these methods to gain a concrete and applied understanding of a widely misunderstood field.
