Bootstrap:AI invites students to explore a variety of commonly used machine learning methods, learning through hands-on applications that AI is neither mystical, nor a panacea. Rather, AI relies on geometry, functions, and statistics. This collection of lessons serves as a rigorous unit on machine learning, which can be integrated into a larger CS or AI class for grades 6-12.
