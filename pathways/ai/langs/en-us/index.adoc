Bootstrap:AI invites students to explore a variety of commonly used machine learning methods, learning through hands-on applications that AI is neither mystical, nor a panacea. Rather, AI relies on geometry, functions, and statistics. The first lesson offers a framework for the remaining lessons, while the second and third lessons provide requisite computer science foundational skills.
