== Summer
@link{lessons/hoc-wescheme-intro/, This Hour of Code lesson} is a great, self-paced activity to introduce students to Bootstrap. Students explore simple function composition and order of operations, and then build on that knowledge to create simple computer graphics.

== Winter
@link{lessons/hoc-winter/, This Hour of Code lesson}, like the summer one, is a gentle introduction to the programming in Bootstrap. It's got a winter theme, with students modifying code to build a snowman!
