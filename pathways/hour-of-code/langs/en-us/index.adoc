Looking for a gentle, self-paced introduction to Bootstrap? Try the Hours of Code below. No prior programming experience required!

== Intro to Graphics

@link{../../lessons/hoc-wescheme-intro/, This Hour of Code lesson} is a great, self-paced activity to introduce students to Bootstrap. Students explore simple function composition and order of operations in WeScheme, and then build on that knowledge to create simple computer graphics.

== Build a Snowman!

@link{../../lessons/hoc-winter/, This Hour of Code lesson} has a winter theme, with the option of students modifying code to build a snowman at the end! More rigorous than the first Hour of Code lesson, it includes videos to support students in learning to code at their own pace in WeScheme.

== Hour of Data

@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/61aeb1da79cd49727623544f, This Hour of Data lesson} is a self-guided Desmos activity. Students explore data visualization, introductory programming using The Pyret Programming Language, and the application of Data Science to solve real problems. Students will investigate a data set of vehicle-wildlife collisions in Vermont and make recommendations about where to build wildlife overpasses.
