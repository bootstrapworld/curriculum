= Bootstrap:Algebra 2

@pathway-logo

These materials are designed for Algebra 2 teachers looking to add a project-based approach to their existing practice. In a few class periods, students will have learned all of the programming they need to explore quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic relationships in data (periodic models coming this fall!).

These were initially developed thanks to a NSF grant, in partnership with @link{https://www.edc.org, Educational Development Center} and @link{https://doe.mass.edu, Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education}.
