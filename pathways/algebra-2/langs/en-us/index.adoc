These materials are designed for Algebra 2 teachers looking to add a project-based approach to their existing practice. In a few class periods, students will have learned all of the programming they need to explore quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, and periodic relationships in data.

*Attention CA teachers!* Schools across CA are *re-imagining Algebra 2* and Integrated Math 3 using these materials, using Data Science to enhance the traditional math sequence with real data and inquiry...*without sacrificing standards*. If your district is interested in offering "Algebra 2/IM3: A Data Science Approach", @link{mailto: info@BootstrapWorld.org, contact us} to see how other districts have integrated these materials into their courses and received Area C approval!

These materials were initially developed thanks to a NSF grant, in partnership with the @link{https://www.edc.org, Educational Development Center} and @link{https://doe.mass.edu, Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education}.
