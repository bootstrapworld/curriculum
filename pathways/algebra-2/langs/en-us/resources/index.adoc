= Teacher Resources for Data Science

== Essentials
- *Online Community (Discourse)* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share out ideas!
- *Contracts* [@link{solution-pages/Contracts.pdf, link}] - A PDF of the contracts pages from the back of the student workbook.
