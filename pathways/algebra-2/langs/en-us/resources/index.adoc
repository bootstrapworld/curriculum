= Teacher Resources for Data Science

== Essentials
- *Online Community* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org, Discourse}] -- Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share ideas!
- *Remote Instruction* [@dist-link{ImplementationNotes.shtml, link}] -- specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.
- *Poster Set for Classroom Walls* [@lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices/pages/computing-pioneers.adoc, link}] -- This poster set features Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics. For greater impact, engage your students with these materials using our @lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices} lesson. (You can also @link{https://www.printme1.com/1100aa4996, purchase a printed set yourself!})
