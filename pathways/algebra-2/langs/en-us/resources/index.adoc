= Teacher Resources for Data Science

== Essentials
- **Online Community** [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org, Discourse}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share ideas!
- **Remote Instruction** [@dist-link{ImplementationNotes.shtml, link}] - specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.
- **Poster Set for Classroom Walls** [@lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices/pages/computing-pioneers.adoc, link}] - This poster set features Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics. For greater impact, engage your students with these materials using our @lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices} lesson.

== Starter Files
Many of our lessons have their own starter files, linked from the materials section of each lesson plan. Below is a collated list of all the starter files from across the curriculum.

== Other Curricular Materials

- **Contracts** [@link{solution-pages/Contracts.pdf, PDF}] - for teachers who want only the contracts reference from the back of the student workbook, without using the entire book.
- **Glossary** [@dist-link{Glossary.shtml?pathway=algebra-2, link}] - All of the vocabulary words (and their definitions) used in this pathway.
- **Bilingual Glossary of Bootstrap Terms (English-Spanish)** [@dist-link{lib/bilingual-glossary.html, PDF}] - For teachers with ELL/ESL students, we provide a bilingual glossary for all of the terms used across our curriculum library.
