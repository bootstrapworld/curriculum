The Bootstrap:Social Studies materials are a collaboration between Bootstrap and  the @link{https://www.kipp.org/, KIPP Charter School Network}, thanks to support from the @link{https://www.robinhood.org/, Robin Hood Foundation}. These materials are actively being developed, and we are sharing two units that have been successfully piloted by KIPP teachers.

The Data Science infused social studies materials are designed for 5th graders, and use spreadsheets as the tool for exploring data. Note: while these materials are explicitly designed and formatted for the KIPP 5^th^ grade curriculum, they can be used by anyone!

Unit 2 - Exploring the Maya Civilization:: What happened to the Maya civilization to cause its sudden collapse? How can we learn about people who lived before there were adequate written records? What can past civilizations teach us about the environment’s role in a society’s survival?
Unit 3 - American Food: Past and Present:: How has the way Americans produce food changed from the time of early Native Americans up until now? Does the way we eat now seem better or worse than before?

== Teaching Remotely?
If you're teaching remotely, we've assembled an @link{../../ImplementationNotes.shtml, Implementation Notes} page that makes specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.
