= Teacher Resources for Algebra

== Essentials
- *Online Community (Discourse)* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org, Discourse}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share out ideas!
- *Collection of Bootstrap:Algebra Desmos Activities* [@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5fbecc2b40d7aa0d844956f0, link}]
- *Contracts* [@link{solution-pages/contracts.pdf, PDF}] - for teachers who want only the contracts reference from the back of the student workbook, without using the entire book.

== Projects in Bootstrap:Algebra
Designing an original video game is the (optional) capstone project for Bootstrap Algebra. This project involves all of the various algebra and programming concepts covered in the lessons, providing students with a creative way to demonstrate their mastery of the material.

You can find the description of this project (and the grading rubric!) at @link{../../../lessons/project-video-game-wescheme, the video game Project Page}.

- *Grading Rubric* [@link{https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YYUmMbE77VwC3W24yZykZe1I0ELL_jE2_NQyH473MY/edit#, Google Doc}] - A simple grading rubric for Design Recipes.

- *Sample Homework Submission Form* [@link{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fyf1xHQElboxDoHy_Voq1YNRy3aRpxIS99ofek5ti8c/viewform, Google Doc}]

- *Broadening Participation* [@link{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17uEl-yS2smjSuOdDLJPzMWWffeXTqBsENjAaZe_qkso/view, Google Slides}] - Making computing relevant, accessible and welcoming to all students isn't a pipe-dream. Like anything else worth doing, it takes some good practice and a desire to do it right and keep improving. We've put together some pointers based on best-practices from the CS-Education literature, for Bootstrap teachers or anyone looking to broaden participation in Computer Science.

== Standalone Hour of Code Activities from Bootstrap

- *Hour of Data* [@lesson-link{hoc-data/, link}] - A self-guided Desmos activity for exploring a real dataset, and using it to make sense of a real-world problem.

- *Snowman Puzzle* [@link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=tt8HB7mig9, link}] - This WeScheme Starterfile has all the pieces your students will need to make a snowman by changing the coordinates in the code.
