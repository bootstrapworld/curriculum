= Teacher Resources for Algebra

== Let's Get Started
- *Online Community* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org, Discourse}] - Talk with other Bootstrap teachers, ask questions, and share ideas!
- *Remote Instruction* [@dist-link{ImplementationNotes.shtml, link}] - specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.
- *Poster Set for Classroom Walls* [@lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices/pages/computing-pioneers.adoc, link}] - This poster set features Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics. For greater impact, engage your students with these materials using our @lesson-link{computing-needs-all-voices} lesson. (You can also @link{https://www.printme1.com/1100aa4996, purchase a printed set yourself!})
- *Information for Families about Bootstrap:Algebra* [@link{pages/info-for-families-alg.adoc, link}]

=== Standalone Hour of Code Activities from Bootstrap

- *Hour of Data* [@lesson-link{hoc-data/, link}] - A self-guided Desmos activity for exploring a real dataset to make sense of a real-world problem.
- *Snowman Puzzle* [@link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=tt8HB7mig9, link}] - This WeScheme Starterfile has all the pieces your students will need to make a snowman by changing the coordinates in the code.

== Projects in Bootstrap:Algebra

The Bootstrap:Algebra curriculum includes three mini projects, each designed to span 2-5 class periods. Projects allow students to express their creativity while showcasing their math and programming skills.

- @lesson-link{project-logo, "Create Your Own Logo"}
- @lesson-link{project-flags, "Make a Flag"}
- @lesson-link{project-function, "Create Your Own Function"}

@lesson-link{project-video-game, "Building an original video game"} is the (optional) capstone project for Bootstrap Algebra. This project involves all of the various algebra and programming concepts covered in the lessons, providing students with a creative way to demonstrate their mastery of the material.

== Other Curricular Materials

- *Contracts* [@link{solution-pages/Contracts.pdf, PDF}] - for teachers who want only the contracts reference from the back of the student workbook, without using the entire book.
- *Glossary* [@dist-link{Glossary.shtml?pathway=algebra-wescheme, link}] - All of the vocabulary words (and their definitions) used in this pathway.
- *Bilingual Glossary of Bootstrap Terms (English-Spanish)* [@dist-link{lib/bilingual-glossary.html, PDF}] - For teachers with ELL/ESL students, we provide a bilingual glossary for all of the terms used across our curriculum library.
- *Blank Design Recipe Worksheet* - [@dist-link{pages/2-blank-wescheme-recipes.adoc, html}] - Use alongside story problems for a function development template.
- *Design Recipe Rubric* [@dist-link{lessons/functions-dr/pages/rubric-dr.adoc, html}]
- *Collection of Bootstrap:Algebra Desmos Activities* [@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/5fbecc2b40d7aa0d844956f0, link}]
- *About Notice and Wonder pedagogy* [@dist-link{pages/notice-wonder.pdf, PDF}]
- *Game Templates*
 * @starter-file{game}
 * @starter-file{sample-game}
 * @starter-file{sample-game-w-distance}
 * @starter-file{sample-game-2d}
