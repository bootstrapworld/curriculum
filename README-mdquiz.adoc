= Writing Assessments

== Installing the Infrastructure

1. `git pull`
2. `nvm use 22.5`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm update mdquiz`
5. You're ready to rock `./build-mdquiz` once you write an assessment!

== Writing an Assessment

=== Setting up the assessments folder inside of the lesson

1. An `assessments` folder can be added to any folder at the same level as `authoring`, `images`, `pages`, etc.
2. The only thing we will see inside the `assessments` folder is subfolders, each one for a single assessment
3. The folder for each assessment included in the lesson should be named to make it clear what the assessment is about / for.
  - This folder must contain a file named `/* quiz.json`
  - If an assessment uses images, they must be stored in this folder.

You can look at `lessons/Data-Science/histograms-visualize/langs/en-us/assessments` for an example.

=== Writing the `/* quiz.json` file

1. It begins with a title that will end up being student-facing.

2. Question Types:
  - We currently have two fully functional question types: "MultipleChoice" and "ShortAnswer". 
  - To insert a slide that does not ask a question, use the type "Informational".

3. Every question must include

   {
    "type": "",
    "prompt": {
        "prompt": ""
        },
    "answer": {
        "answer": ""
        }
    }

4. Some questions have an additional "context", which provides clarifying information and/or hints for students answering the question. 

    "context": "If there is no mode, write: none\n. If there is more than one mode, separate the numbers with commas, for example by writing: 5,7\n."
    }, 

5.  MultipleChoice questions also include "distractors". By default the order of the distractors and answer is randomized. To specify the order we should... TODO CONFIRM THIS WITH ES

    "distractors": [
          "`x` is stored in the immutable region of memory.",
          "After being defined, `x` can be changed at most once.",
          "You cannot create a reference to `x`.![alt text](./react.svg 'react logo')"
        ]

6. \n is used to insert a new line in the middle of a string.

Below is an example of what the complete json might look like. 

[options="nowrap"]
  {
    "title": "Emmanuel's Demo Quizs",
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "MultipleChoice",
        "prompt": {
          "prompt": "What does it mean if a variable `x` is immutable?\n",
          "distractors": [
            "`x` is stored in the immutable region of memory.",
            "After being defined, `x` can be changed at most once.",
            "You cannot create a reference to `x`.![alt text](./react.svg 'react logo')"
          ]
        },
        "answer": {
            "answer": "`x` cannot be changed after being assigned to a value."
        },
        "context": "Immutable means \"not mutable\", or not changeable.\n"
      },
      {
          "type": "ShortAnswer",
          "prompt": {
              "prompt": "What is the keyword used after `let` to indicate that a variable can be mutated?"
          },
          "image": "./react.svg",
          "answer": {
              "answer": "mut"
          },
          "context": "For example, you can make a mutable variable `x` by writing: `let mut x = 1`.\n",
      },
      {
          "type": "Informational",
          "prompt": {
              "prompt": "Hello! Good news! This is just a poster, no questions to answer."
          },
          "image": "https://www.bootstrapworld.org/images/icon.png",
          "context": "It's so awesome!\n",
      }
      ]
    }


=== To build your quiz

1. Type `./build-mdquiz` in your terminal.
  - If you get an error like the following one `The quiz.json file inside distribution/en-us/lessons/measures-of-center/assessments/mean-median-modes-checkin is not valid JSON!`
    ** Open a browser window and type "json validator" or navigate directly to https://jsonlint.com/
    ** Select All and copy the contents of your `/* quiz.json` file. 
    ** Paste the full contents of the document into the json validator. 
    ** Click "validate" and it will identify the first issue with the file. Identify and repeat validation until you get a "JSON is valid!" message.
    ** Update the file in sublime and rerun `./build-mdquiz`.
2. Navigate to `distribution/lessons/name-of-lesson/assessments/name-of-assessment/index.html`

You'll see a webpage pop up. It will say:

Quiz +
# of questions +
Start

When you click Start you will see the first question and you will need to enter a bogus answer (just choose A) in order to see the next question.

After you complete the quiz you will see a summary of the quiz.
